INSTALL

Installation is a bit hairy at the moment. Currently you need to create a new Content type named 'oai_pmh_record', with the following fields/types

Creator   Text  
 
Date    Date  
 
Identifier  Text  
 
Language  Text  
 
Record Type Text

This all needs to be automated in an install, but this is still a pre-release. If you have any questions, first try reading the source (its not too complex), then shoot me an email, pletcher@longsight.com
