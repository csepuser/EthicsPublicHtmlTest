          <p>Most discussions of engineering ethics dismiss the idea of codes 
            of ethics from the outset. Codes are described as self-serving, unrealistic, 
            inconsistent, mere guides for novices, too vague, or unnecessary.(1) 
            I will not do that here. Instead, I will argue that a code of professional 
            ethics is central to advising individual engineers how to conduct 
            themselves, to judging their conduct, and ultimately to understanding 
            engineering as a profession. I will begin with a case now commonly 
            discussed in engineering ethics, finding my general argument in a 
            detailed analysis of a particular choice. While I believe the analysis 
            to be applicable to all professions, I shall not argue that here.</p>
          <p><br>
            <strong>I. THE CHALLENGER DISASTER(2)</strong><br>
            On the night of 27 January 1986, Robert Lund was worried. The Space 
            Center was counting down for a shuttle launch the next morning. Lund, 
            vice-president for engineering at Morton Thiokol, had earlier presided 
            over a meeting of engineers that unanimously recommended against the 
            launch. He had concurred and informed his boss, Jerald Mason. Mason 
            informed the Space Center. Lund had expected the flight to be postponed. 
            The Center's safety record was good. It was good because the Center 
            would not allow a launch unless the technical people approved.</p>
          <p>Lund had not approved. He had not approved because the temperature 
            at the launch site would be close to freezing at lift-off. The Space 
            Center was worried about the ice already forming in places on the 
            boosters, but Lund's worry was the &quot;O-rings&quot; sealing the 
            boosters' segments. They had been a great idea, permitting Thiokol 
            to build the huge rocket in Utah and ship it in pieces to the Space 
            Center two thousand miles away. Building in Utah was so much more 
            efficient than building on-site that Thiokol had been able to underbid 
            the competition. The shuttle contract had earned Thiokol $150 million 
            in profits.</p>
          <p>But, as everyone now knows, the O-rings were not perfect. Data from 
            previous flights indicated that the rings tended to erode in flight, 
            with the worst erosion occurring on the coldest preceding lift-off. 
            Experimental evidence was sketch but ominous. Erosion seemed to increase 
            as the rings lost their resiliency, and resiliency decreased with 
            temperature. At a certain temperature, the rings could lose so much 
            resiliency that one could fail to seal properly. If a ring failed 
            in flight, the shuttle could explode.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, almost no testing had been done below 40&thorn; F. 
            The engineers' scarcetime had had to be devoted to other problems, 
            forcing them to extrapolate from the little data they had. But, with 
            the lives of seven astronauts at stake, the decision seemed clear 
            enough: Safety first.</p>
          <p>Or so it had seemed earlier that day. Now Lund was not so sure. The 
            Space Center had been &quot;surprised,&quot; even &quot;appalled,&quot; 
            by the evidence on which the no-launch recommendation had been based. 
            They wanted to launch. They did not say why, but they did not have 
            to. The shuttle program was increasingly falling behind its ambitious 
            launch schedule. Congress had been grumbling for some time. And if 
            the launch went as scheduled, the president would be able to announce 
            the first teacher in space as part of his State of the Union message 
            the following evening, very good publicity just when the shuttle program 
            needed some.</p>
          <p>The Space Center wanted to launch. But they would not launch without 
            Thiokol's approval. They urged Mason to reconsider. He reexamined 
            the evidence and decided the rings should hold at the expected temperature. 
            Joseph Kilminster, Thiokol's vice-president for shuttle programs, 
            was ready to sign a launch approval, but only if Lund approved. Lund 
            was now all that stood in the way of launching.</p>
          <p>Lund's first response was to repeat his objections. But then Mason 
            said something that made him think again. Mason asked him to think 
            like a manager rather than an engineer. (The exact words seem to have 
            been, &quot;Take off your engineering hat and put on you management 
            hat.&quot;) Lund did and changed his mind. The next morning the shuttle 
            exploded during lift-off, killing all aboard. An O-ring had failed.</p>
          <p>Should Lund have reversed his decision and approved the launch? In 
            retrospect, of course, the answer is obvious: No. But most problems 
            concerning what we should do would hardly be problems at all if we 
            could foresee all the consequences of what we do. Fairness to Lund 
            requires us to ask whether he should have approved the launch given 
            only the information available to him at the time. And since Lund 
            seems to have reversed his decision and approved the launch because 
            he began to think like a manager rather than an engineer, we need 
            to consider whether Lund, an engineer, should have been thinking like 
            a manager rather than an engineer. But, before we can consider that, 
            we need to know what the difference is between thinking like a manager 
            and thinking like an engineer.</p>
          <p>One explanation of the difference stresses technical knowledge. Managers, 
            it might be said, are trained to handle people; engineers, to handle 
            things. To think like a manager rather than an engineer is to focus 
            on people rather than on things. According to this explanation, Lund 
            was asked to concern himself primarily with how best to handle his 
            boss, the Space Center, and his own engineers. He was to draw upon 
            his knowledge of engineering only as he might draw upon his knowledge 
            of foreign language, for example, to help him communicate with his 
            engineers. He was to act much as he would have acted had he never 
            earned a degree in engineering.</p>
          <p>If that explanation of what Mason was asking of Lund seems implausible 
            (as I think it does), what is the alternative? If Mason did not mean 
            that Lund should make his knowledge of engineering peripheral (as 
            it seems Mason, himself an engineer, did not when he personally reexamined 
            the evidence), what was he asking Lund to do? What is it to think 
            like an engineer if not simply to use one's technical knowledge of 
            things? That is a question engineers have been asking for almost a 
            century. Answers have often been expressed in a formal code of ethics.</p>
          <p>That may seem odd. What business, it may be asked, do engineering 
            societies have promulgating codes of ethics? What could they be thinking? 
            Ethics is not a matter for majority vote but for private conscience, 
            or, if not for private conscience, then for experts; and the experts 
            in ethics are philosophers or clergy, not engineers. Such thoughts 
            make any connection between engineering and ethics look dubious. So, 
            before we can say more about what Lund should have done, we have to 
            understand the connection.</p>
          <p><strong>II. THE POSSIBILITY OF ENGINEERING ETHICS</strong><br>
            A code of (professional) ethics generally appears when an occupation 
            organizes itself into a profession. Usually, the code is put in writing 
            and formally adopted. Even when formalization is put off, however, 
            the code may still be a subject of frequent reference, whether explicitly, 
            as in &quot;our code of ethics,&quot; or implicitly, as in, &quot;That 
            would not be proper for one of us.&quot;</p>
          <p>Why this connection between codes of (professional) ethics and organized 
            professions? Several explanations have been offered over the years.(3) 
            But, for our purposes, the most helpful is that a code of ethics is 
            primarily a convention between professionals.(4) According to this 
            explanation, a profession is a group of persons who want to cooperate 
            in serving the same ideal better than they could if they did not cooperate. 
            Engineers, for example, might be thought to serve the ideal of efficient 
            design, construction, and maintenance of safe and useful objects. 
            A code of ethics would then prescribe how professionals are to pursue 
            their common ideal so that each may do the best she can at minimal 
            cost to herself and those she cares about (including the public, if 
            looking after the public is part of what she cares about). The code 
            is to protect each professional from certain pressures (for example, 
            the pressure to cut corners to save money) by making it reasonably 
            likely (and more likely than otherwise) that most other members of 
            the profession will not take advantage of her good conduct. A code 
            protects members of a profession from certain consequences of competition. 
            A code is a solution to a coordination problem.</p>
          <p>According to this explanation, an occupation does not need society's 
            recognition in order to be a profession. It needs only a practice 
            among its members of cooperation to serve a certain ideal. Once an 
            occupation has become a profession, society has a reason to give it 
            special privileges (for example, the sole right to do certain work) 
            if, but only if, society wants to support serving the ideal in question 
            in the way the profession has chosen to serve it. Otherwise, it may 
            leave the profession unrecognized.</p>
          <p>A profession, as such, is like a union in that it is organized to 
            serve the interests of its members, and unlike a charity or government, 
            which is organized to serve someone else's interest. But professions 
            differ form unions in the interest they are organized to serve. Unions 
            are, like businesses, primarily organizations of self-interest. They 
            exist for the benefit of their members, just as businesses exist for 
            the profit of their owners. A profession, in contrast, is organized 
            to help members serve others-according to a certain ideal expressed 
            in its code of ethics. In this sense, professions are organized for 
            public service. That, I think, is true by definition. But it is not 
            a mere semantic truth. When a group of individuals constitute themselves 
            as a &quot;profession,&quot; they explicitly invoke this way of understanding 
            what they are up to. They invite examination according to the standards 
            proper to such an undertaking. They give what they do a distinct context.</p>
          <p>Understanding a code of (professional) ethics as a convention between 
            professionals, we can explain why engineers cannot depend on mere 
            private conscience when choosing how to practice their profession, 
            no matter how good that private conscience, and why engineers should 
            take into account what an organization of engineers has to say about 
            what engineers should do.(5) What conscience would tell us to do absent 
            a certain convention is not necessarily what conscience would tell 
            us given that convention. Insofar as a code of professional ethics 
            is a kind of (morally permissible) convention, it provides a guide 
            to what engineers may reasonably expect of one another, what (more 
            or less) &quot;the rules of the game&quot; are. Just as we must know 
            the rules of baseball to know what to do with the ball, so we must 
            know engineering ethics to know, for example, whether, as engineers, 
            we should merely weigh safety against the wishes of our employer or 
            instead give safety preference over those wishes.</p>
          <p>A code of ethics should also provide a guide to what we may expect 
            other members of our profession to help us do. If, for example, part 
            of being an engineer is putting safety first, then Lund's engineers 
            had a right to expect his support. When Lund's boss asked him to think 
            like a manager rather than an engineer, he should, as an engineer, 
            have responded,&quot;Sorry, if you wanted a vice-president who would 
            think like a manager rather than an engineer, you should not have 
            hired an engineer.&quot;(6)</p>
          <p>If Lund had so responded, he would, as we shall see, have responded 
            as &quot;the rules of the engineering game&quot; require. But would 
            he have done the right thing, not simply according to those rules 
            but all things considered? This is not an empty question. Even games 
            can be irrational or immoral. (Think, for example, of a game in which 
            you score points by cutting off your fingers or by shooting people 
            who happen to pass in the street below.) People are not merely members 
            of this or that profession. They are also persons with responsibilities 
            beyond their professions, moral agents who cannot escape conscience, 
            criticism, blame, or punishment just by showing that they did what 
            they did because their profession required it. While we have now explained 
            why an engineer should, as an engineer, take account of his profession's 
            code of ethics, we have not explained why anyone should be an engineer 
            in this sense.</p>
          <p>Let me put the point more dramatically. Suppose Lund's boss had responded 
            to what we just imagined Lund to say to him: &quot;Yes, we hired an 
            engineer, but-we supposed- an engineer with common sense, one who 
            understood just how much weight a rational person gives a code of 
            ethics in decisions of this kind. Be reasonable. Your job and mine 
            are on the line. The future of Thiokol is also on the line. Safety 
            counts a lot. But other things do, too. If we block this launch, the 
            Space Center will start looking for someone more agreeable to supply 
            boosters.&quot;</p>
          <p>If acting as one's professional code requires is really justified, 
            we should be able to explain to Lund (and his boss) why, as a rational 
            person, Lund should support his profession's code as a guide for all 
            engineers and why, even in his trying circumstances, he cannot justify 
            treating himself as an exception.</p>
          <p><strong>III. WHY OBEY ONE'S PROFESSIONAL CODE?</strong><br>
            The question now is why, all things considered, an engineer should 
            obey her profession's code. We should begin by dismissing two alternatives 
            some people find plausible. One is that Lund should do as his profession 
            requires because he &quot;promised,&quot; for example, by joining 
            an engineering society having a code of ethics. We must dismiss this 
            answer because it is at least possible that Lund never did anything 
            we could plausibly characterize as promising to follow a formal code. 
            Lund could, for example, have refused to join any professional society 
            having a code (as perhaps half of all U.S. engineers do). Yet, it 
            seems such a refusal would not excuse him from conducting himself 
            as an engineer should. The obligations of an engineer do not seem 
            to rest on anything so contingent as a promise, oath, or vow. So, 
            the &quot;convention between professionals&quot; (as I called it) 
            is not a contract. It is more like what lawyers call a &quot;quasi-contract&quot; 
            or a &quot;contract implied in law&quot;; that is, an obligation resting 
            not on an actual agreement (whether express or tacit) but on what 
            it is fair to require of someone given what he has voluntarily done, 
            such as accepted the benefits that go with claiming to be an engineer.</p>
          <p>The other plausible alternative we can quickly dismiss is that Lund 
            should do as his profession requires because &quot;society&quot; says 
            he should. We may dismiss this answer in part because it is not clear 
            that society does say that. One way society has of saying things is 
            through law. No law binds all engineers to abide by their profession's 
            code (as the law does bind all lawyers to abide by theirs).(7) Of 
            course, society has ways of saying things other than by law, for example, 
            by public opinion. But it seems doubtful that the public knows enough 
            about engineering to have an opinion on most matters of engineering 
            ethics. And even on the matter before us, can we honestly say that 
            society wants engineers to do as their code requires (treat safety 
            as paramount, as explained below) rather than (as most people would) 
            treat safety as an important consideration to balance against others?</p>
          <p>However that question is answered, it seems plain that neither public 
            opinion nor law should decide what it is rational or moral to do. 
            After all, there have been both irrational laws (for example, those 
            requiring the use of outmoded techniques) and immoral laws (for example, 
            those enforcing slavery). The public opinion supporting such laws 
            could not have been much less irrational or immoral than the laws 
            themselves.</p>
          <p>The two answers we have now dismissed share one notable feature. 
            Either would, if defensible, provide a reason to do as one's profession 
            requires quite independently of what in particular the profession 
            happens to require. The answers do not take account of the contents 
            of the code of ethics. They are formal. The answers we shall now consider 
            is not formal. It is that supporting a code of ethics with a certain 
            content is rational because supporting any code with a content of 
            that sort is rational.</p>
          <p>Consider, for example, the code of ethics drafted by the Accreditation 
            Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) and adopted by all major 
            American societies except the National Society of Professional Engineers 
            and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. The code 
            is divided into &quot;fundamental principles,&quot; &quot;fundamental 
            canons,&quot; and (much more detailed) &quot;guidelines.&quot; The 
            fundamental principles simply describe in general terms an ideal of 
            service. Engineers &quot;uphold and advance the integrity, honor and 
            dignity of the engineering profession by: I. using their knowledge 
            and skill for the enhancement of human welfare, II. being honest and 
            impartial, and serving with fidelity the public, their employers and 
            clients[and so on].&quot; What rational person could object to others' 
            trying to achieve that ideal? Or at least, what rational person could 
            object so long as their doing so did not interfere with what she was 
            doing? Surely every engineer-indeed, every member of society-is likely 
            to be better off overall if engineers uphold and advance the integrity, 
            honor, and dignity of engineering in that way.</p>
          <p>Below the fundamental principles are the fundamental canons. The 
            canons lay down general duties. For example, engineers are required 
            to &quot;hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public,&quot; 
            to &quot;issue public statements only in an objective and truthful 
            manner,&quot; to &quot;act in professional matters for each employer 
            or client as faithful agents and trustees,&quot; and to &quot;avoid 
            all conflicts of interest.&quot; Each engineer stands to benefit from 
            these requirements both as ordinary person and as engineer. The benefits 
            for an engineer as ordinary person are obvious: As an ordinary person, 
            an engineer is likely to be safer, healthier, and otherwise better 
            off if engineers generally hold paramount the public safety, only 
            make truthful public statements, and so on. How engineers stand to 
            benefit as engineers is less obvious. So, let us try a thought experiment.</p>
          <p>Imagine what engineering would be like if engineers did not generally 
            act as the canons require. If, for example, engineers did not generally 
            hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public, what 
            would it be like to be an engineer? The day-to-day work would, of 
            course, be much the same. But every now and then an engineer could 
            not object as an engineer. An engineer could, of course, still object 
            &quot;personally&quot; and refuse to do the job. But if he did, he 
            would risk being replaced by an engineer who would not object. An 
            employer or client might rightly treat an engineer's personal qualms 
            as a disability, much like a tendency to make errors. The engineer 
            would be under tremendous pressure to keep &quot;personal opinions&quot; 
            to himself and get on with the job. His interests as an engineer would 
            conflict with his interests as a person.</p>
          <p>That, then, is why each engineer can generally expect to benefit 
            from other engineers' acting as their common code requires. The benefits 
            are, I think, clearly substantial enough to explain how an individual 
            could rationally enter into a convention that would equally limit 
            what he himself can do.</p>
          <p>I have not, however, shown that every engineer must benefit overall 
            from such a convention, or even that any engineer will consider these 
            benefits sufficient to justify the burdens required to achieve them. 
            Professions, like governments, are not always worth the trouble of 
            maintaining them. Whether a particular profession is worth the trouble 
            is an empirical question. Professions nonetheless differ from governments 
            in at least one way relevant here. Professions are voluntary in a 
            way that governments are not. No one is born into a profession. One 
            must claim professional status to have it (by taking a degree, for 
            example, or accepting a job for which professional status is required). 
            We therefore have good reason to suppose that people are engineers 
            because, on balance, they prefer to have the benefits of being an 
            engineer, even given what is required of them in exchange.</p>
          <p>If, as we shall now assume, the only way to obtain the benefits in 
            question is to make it part of being an engineer that the public safety, 
            health, and welfare come first, every engineer, including Lund, has 
            good reason to want engineers generally to adhere to something like 
            the ABET code. But why should an engineer adhere to it himself when, 
            as in Lund's case, it seems he (or his employer or client) stands 
            to benefit by departing from it?</p>
          <p>If the question is one of justification, the answer is obvious. Lund 
            would have to justify his departure from the code by appealing to 
            such considerations as the welfare of Thiokol and his own self-interest. 
            An appeal to such considerations is just what Lund could not incorporate 
            into a code of ethics for engineers or generally allow other engineers 
            to use in defense of what they did. Lund could not incorporate such 
            an exception into a code because its incorporation would defeat the 
            purpose of the code. A code of ethics is necessary in part because, 
            without it, the self-interest of individual engineers, or even their 
            selfless devotion to their employer, could lead them to harm everyone 
            overall. Lund could not allow other engineers to defend what they 
            did by appeal to their own interests or that of their employer for 
            much the same reason. To allow such appeals would be to contribute 
            to the breakdown of a practice Lund has good reason to support.</p>
          <p>I take this argument to explain why, all things considered, Lund 
            should have done as his profession's code requires, not why he should 
            have done so in some premoral sense. I am answering the question &quot;Why 
            be ethical?&quot; not &quot;Why be moral?&quot; I therefore have the 
            luxury of falling back on ordinary moral principles to determine what 
            is right, all things considered. The moral principle on which this 
            argument primarily relies is the principle of fairness. Since Lund 
            voluntarily accepts the benefits of being an engineer (by claiming 
            to be an engineer), he is morally obliged to follow the (morally permissible) 
            convention that helps to make those benefits possible.(8) What I have 
            been at pains to show is how that convention helps to make those benefits 
            possible, and why, even now, he has good reason to endorse the convention 
            generally.</p>
          <p>I have been assuming that engineers do in fact generally act in accordance 
            with the ABET code, whether or not they know it exists. If that assumption 
            were mistaken, Lund would have had no professional reason to do as 
            the code requires. The code should be a dead letter, not a living 
            practice. It would have much the same status as a &quot;model statute&quot; 
            no government ever adopted, or the rules of a cooperative game no 
            one plays. Lund would have had to rely on private judgment. But relying 
            on private judgment is not necessary here. Lund's engineers seem to 
            have recommended as they did because they thought the safety of the 
            public, including astronauts, paramount. They did what, according 
            to the code, engineers are supposed to do. Their recommendation is 
            itself evidence that the codecorresponds to a living practice.(9)</p>
          <p>So, when Lund's boss asked him to think like a manager rather than 
            an engineer, he was in effect asking Lund to think in a way that Lund 
            must consider unjustified for engineers generally and for which Lund 
            can give no morally defensible principle for making himself an exception. 
            When Lund did as his boss asked (supposing he did), he in effect let 
            down all those engineers who helped to establish the practice that 
            today allows engineers to say &quot;no&quot; in such circumstances 
            with the reasonable hope that the client or employer will defer to 
            their professional judgment, and that other engineers will come to 
            their aid if the client or employer does not defer.</p>
          <p>Lund could, of course, still explain how his action served his own 
            interests and those of Thiokol (or, rather, how they seemed to at 
            the time).(10) He could also just thumb his nose at all talk of engineering 
            ethics, though that would probably lead to the government's barring 
            him from working on any project it funds, to fellow engineers' refusing 
            to have anything to do with him, and to his employer's coming to view 
            him as an embarrassment. What he cannot do is show that what he did 
            was right, all things considered.</p>
          <p>This conclusion assumes that I have not overlooked any relevant consideration. 
            I certainly may have. But that is not important here. I have not examined 
            Lund's decision in order to condemn him but in order to bring to light 
            the place of a code of ethics in engineering. There is more to understand.</p>
          <p><strong>IV. INTERPRETING A CODE OF ETHICS</strong><br>
            So far we have assumed that Lund did as his boss asked, that is, that 
            he thought like a manager rather than an engineer. Assuming that allowed 
            us to give a relatively clear explanation of what was wrong with what 
            Lund did: Lund acted like a manager when he was also an engineer and 
            should have acted like one.</p>
          <p>We must, however, now put that assumption aside and consider whether 
            engineering ethics actually forbids Lund to do what it seemed he did, 
            that is, weigh his own interests, his employer's, and his client's 
            against the safety of the seven astronauts. Ordinary morality seems 
            to allow such weighing. For example, no one would think you did something 
            morally wrong if you drove your child to school, rather than letting 
            him take the bus, even if your presence on the road increased somewhat 
            the risk that someone would be killed in a traffic accident. Morality 
            allows us to give special weight to the interests of those close to 
            us.(11) If engineering ethics allows that too, then Lund-whatever 
            he may have thought he was doing-would not actually have acted unprofessionally. 
            Let us then imagine Lund's reading of the ABET code. What could he 
            infer?</p>
          <p>Of the code's seven fundamental canons, only two seem relevant: (1) 
            &quot;[holding] paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public&quot; 
            and (4) &quot;[acting] in professional matters for each employer or 
            client as faithful agents or trustees.&quot; What do these provisions 
            tell Lund to do? The answer is not all that clear. Does &quot;public&quot; 
            include the seven astronauts? They are, after all, employees of Thiokol's 
            client, the Space Center, not part of the public as are, say, those 
            ordinary citizens who watch launches from the beach opposite the Space 
            Center. And what is it to be a &quot;faithful agent or trustee&quot; 
            of one's client or employer? Is it to serve all the interests of a 
            client or employer, or only the financial ones? And how is one to 
            determine even those? Does the client or employer have the final word, 
            or may an engineer make an independent assessment? After all, the 
            actual result of Lund's decision was disaster for both employer and 
            client, though one both employer and client may have thought themselves 
            justified in risking. And what is Lund to do if the public welfare 
            requires what no faithful agent or trustee could do? Does &quot;holding 
            paramount&quot; the public welfare include sometimes acting as a faithful 
            agent or trustee would not act?</p>
          <p>These questions are surprisingly easy to answer if we keep in mind 
            the connection between professions and codes of ethics, remembering 
            especially that a code is not a stone tablet inscribed with divine 
            wisdom but the work of engineers, a set of rules that is supposed 
            to win the support of engineers because the rules help engineers do 
            what they want to do.</p>
          <p>The language of any document, codes included, must be interpreted 
            in light of what it is reasonable to suppose its authors intend.(12) 
            For example, if &quot;bachelor&quot; appears undefined in a marriage 
            statute, we interpret it as referring to single males, but if the 
            same word appears in directions for a college's graduation ceremony, 
            we instead interpret it as referring to all students getting their 
            baccalaureate, whether male or female, single or married. That is 
            the reasonable interpretation because we know that marriages usually 
            involve single males (as well as single females) rather than people 
            with baccalaureates while just the reverse is true of graduation ceremonies. 
            So, once we figure out what it is reasonable to suppose engineers 
            intend by declaring the &quot;public&quot; safety, health, and welfare 
            &quot;paramount,&quot; we should be able to decide whether interpreting 
            &quot;public&quot; so that it includes &quot;employees&quot; is what 
            engineers intend (or at least what, as rational persons, they should 
            intend) and also whether they intend the paramountcy requirement to 
            take precedence over the duty to act as a faithful agent or trustee.</p>
          <p>The authors of a code of engineering ethics (whether those who originally 
            drafted or approved it or those who now give it their support) are 
            all more or less rational persons. They differ from most other rational 
            persons only in knowing what engineers must know in order to be engineers 
            and in performing duties they could not perform (or could not perform 
            as well) but for that knowledge. It is therefore reasonable to suppose 
            that their code of ethics would not require them to risk their own 
            safety, health, or welfare, or that of anyone for whom they care, 
            except for some substantial good (for example, high pay or service 
            to some ideal to which they are committed). It also seems reasonable 
            to suppose that no code they authored would include anything people 
            generally consider immoral. Most engineers are probably morally decent 
            people, unlikely to endorse an immoral rule.</p>
          <p>But what if that were not true? What if most engineers were moral 
            monsters or just self-serving opportunists? What then? Interpreting 
            their code would certainly be different, and probably harder. We could 
            not understand it as a professional code. We would have to switch 
            to principles of interpretation we reserve for mere folkways, Nazi 
            statutes, or the like. We would have to leave the presuppositions 
            of ethics behind.</p>
          <p>But, given those presuppositions, we can easily explain why a code 
            of engineering ethics would make holding the public safety paramount 
            a duty taking precedence over all others, including the duty to act 
            as a faithful agent or trustee. Rational engineers would want to avoid 
            situations in which only their private qualms stood between them and 
            a use of professional knowledge they considered morally wrong or otherwise 
            undesirable. Each would, as we say, want to be reasonably sure that 
            the knowledge of other engineers would serve the public, even when 
            the interests of the public conflicted with those of employer or client. 
            Given this purpose, what must &quot;public&quot; mean?</p>
          <p>We might interpret &quot;public&quot; as equivalent to &quot;everyone&quot; 
            (in the society, locale, or whatever). On this interpretation, the 
            &quot;public safety&quot; would mean the safety of everyone more or 
            less equally. A danger that struck only children, or only those with 
            bad lungs, or the like, would not endanger &quot;the public.&quot; 
            This interpretation must be rejected. Since few dangers are likely 
            to threaten everyone, interpreting &quot;public&quot; to mean &quot;everyone&quot; 
            would yield a duty to the public too weak to protect most engineers 
            from having to do things that would generally make life for themselves 
            (and those they care about) far worse than it would otherwise be, 
            even allowing for the occasional benefit they might obtain as individuals.</p>
          <p>We might also interpret &quot;public&quot; as referring to &quot;anyone&quot; 
            (in the society, locale, or whatever). On this interpretation, public 
            safety would be equivalent to the safety of some or all. Holding the 
            public safety paramount would mean never putting anyone in danger. 
            If our first interpretation of &quot;public&quot; made provisions 
            protection the public too weak, this second would make them too strong. 
            For example, it is hard to imagine how we could have electric power 
            stations, mountain tunnels, or chemical plants without some risk to 
            someone. No rational engineer could endorse a code of ethics that 
            made engineering virtually impossible.</p>
          <p>We seem, then, to need an interpretation of &quot;public&quot; invoking 
            some more relevant feature of people, rather than, as we have so far, 
            just their number. I would suggest that what makes people a public 
            is their relative innocence, helplessness, or passivity. On this interpretation, 
            &quot;public&quot; would refer to those persons whose lack of information, 
            technical knowledge, or time for deliberation renders them more or 
            less vulnerable to the powers an engineer wields on behalf of his 
            client or employer. An engineer should hold paramount the public safety, 
            health, and welfare to assure that engineers will not be forced to 
            give too little regard to the welfare of these &quot;innocents.&quot;</p>
          <p>On this third interpretation, someone might be part of the public 
            in one respect but not in another. For example the astronauts would 
            be part of the public with respect to the O-rings because, not knowing 
            of the danger, they were in no position to abort the launch to avoid 
            the danger. The astronauts would, in contrast, not be part of the 
            public with respect to the ice forming on the boosters because, having 
            been fully informed of that danger, they were in a position to abort 
            the launch if they were unwilling to take the risk the risk the ice 
            posed. This third interpretation of &quot;public&quot; thus seems 
            to be free of the difficulties that discredited the preceding two. 
            We now seem to have a sense of &quot;holding the public safety paramount&quot; 
            that we may reasonably suppose rational engineers would endorse.</p>
          <p>On this interpretation, the engineer's code of ethics would (all 
            else equal) require Lund either to refuse to authorize the launch 
            or to insist instead that the astronauts be briefed in order to get 
            their informed consent to the risk. Refusing authorization would protect 
            the public by holding the safety of the astronauts paramount. Insisting 
            that the astronauts be briefed and decide for themselves would hold 
            the safety of the public paramount by transferring the astronauts 
            from the category of members of the public to that of informed participants 
            in the decision. Either way, Lund would not, under the circumstances, 
            have had to treat his own interest, those of his employer Thiokol, 
            or those of his client the Space Center as comparable to those of 
            the public (assuming, of course, what is not true, that we have considered 
            all the public interests relevant here).</p>
          <p>Is this the correct interpretation of &quot;public&quot;? It is if 
            we have taken into account every relevant consideration. Have we? 
            There is, of course, no way to know. But there is good reason to think 
            we have. We can easily show that the only obvious alternative is wrong. 
            That alternative is that &quot;public&quot; refers to all &quot;innocents&quot; 
            except employees of the client or employer in question. Employees 
            are to be excluded because, it might be said, they are paid to take 
            the risks associated with their job. On this interpretation, Lund 
            would not have to hold the safety of the astronauts paramount, since 
            they would not be part of the public.</p>
          <p>What is wrong with this fourth interpretation of &quot;public&quot;? 
            Earlier, we understood &quot;innocents&quot; to include all persons 
            whose lack of information, training, or time for deliberation renders 
            them vulnerable to the powers an engineer wields on behalf of his 
            client or employer. An employee who takes a job knowing the risks 
            (and is otherwise able to avoid them) might be able to insist on being 
            paid enough to compensate for them. She could then truly be said to 
            be paid to take those risks. She would not be an &quot;innocent.&quot; 
            But she would, under our third interpretation, also not in that respect 
            be part of the public to which an engineer owed a paramount duty. 
            She would have given informed consent to the risk in question. So, 
            the third and fourth interpretations would not differ concerning such 
            an employee.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, if the employee lacked the information to evaluate 
            the risk, she would be in no position to insist on adequate compensation. 
            She could not be said to be paid to take those risks. She would, in 
            other words, be as innocent of, as vulnerable to, and as unpaid for 
            the risks in question as anyone else in the public. Since nothing 
            prevents an engineer, or someone for whom an engineer cares, from 
            being the employee unknowingly at risk, engineers have as much reason 
            to want to protect such employees as to protect the public in general. 
            &quot;Public&quot; should be interpreted accordingly; that is, according 
            to our third interpretation.</p>
          <p><strong>V. PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES</strong><br>
            Given the argument developed so far, engineers clearly are responsible 
            for acting as their profession's code of ethics requires. Do their 
            professional responsibilities go beyond the code? The answer, I think, 
            is clearly yes. Engineers should not only do as their profession's 
            code requires, but should also support it less directly by encouraging 
            others to do as it requires and by criticizing, ostracizing, or otherwise 
            calling to account those who do not. They should support their profession's 
            code in these ways for at least four reasons: First, engineers should 
            support their profession's code because supporting it will help protect 
            them and those they care about from being injured by what other engineers 
            do. Second, supporting the code will also help assure each engineer 
            a working environment in which it will be easier than it would otherwise 
            be to resist pressure to do much that the engineer would rather not 
            do. Third, engineers should support their profession's code because 
            supporting it helps make their profession a practice of which they 
            need not feel morally justified embarrassment, shame, or guilt. And 
            fourth, one has an obligation of fairness to do his part insofar as 
            he claims to be an engineer and other engineers are doing their part 
            in generating these benefits for all engineers.</p>

            Revisited, ed. J. Roland Pennock and John W. Chapman (New York: New

            Review 34 (1990): 163-86. <br>
            <strong>5.</strong> Here, then, is an important contrast between my 
            position and the &quot;personal analysis&quot; of professional duties 
            one finds, for example, in Thomas Shaffer, &quot;Advocacy as Moral 
            Discourse,&quot; North Carolina Law Review 57 (1979): 647-70; or Charles 
            Fried, &quot;The Lawyer as Friend: The Moral Foundations of the Lawyer-Client 
            Relation,&quot; Yale Law Review 85 (1976): 1060-89. Unlike these others, 
            I do not treat professional activity as primarily involving a relation 
            between one person with an important skill (the professional) and 
            a series of others (the client, patient, or whatever). The appeal 
            of the personal analysis probably comes from focusing too much on 
            professions, like law and medicine, that have a clearly defined client. 
            One feature of engineering that should make it more interesting to 
            students of professional ethics than it has been is the absence (or 
            relative unimportance) of individual clients. In this respect, engineering 
            may represent the future of law, and perhaps even of medicine. <br>
            <strong>6.</strong>Cf. my &quot;The Special Role of Professionals 
            in Business Ethics,&quot; Business and Professional Ethics Journal 
            7 (1988): 83-94. <br>
            <strong>7.</strong> Some engineers, so-called Professional Engineers 
            (PEs.), are bound by law in exactly the way lawyers, doctors, and 
            other state-licensed professionals are. But most engineers in the 
            United States-nearly 80 percent-are not so licensed. They practice 
            engineering under the &quot;manufacturer's exemption.&quot; They can 
            practice engineering only through a company with a PE, who must ultimately 
            &quot;sign off&quot; on their work. <br>
            <strong>8.</strong> I hope this appeal to fairness will raise no red 
            flags, even though the principle of fairness has been under a cloud 
            ever since the seemingly devastating criticism it received in Robert 
            Nozick, Anarchy, State, and Utopia (New York: Basic Books, 1974). 
            I have, it should be noted, limited my use to obligations generated 
            by voluntarily claiming benefits of a cooperative practice that are 
            otherwise not available. Most attacks on the principle of fairness 
            have been on the &quot;involuntary benefits&quot; version. See, e.g., 
            A. John Simmons, Moral Principles and Political Obligations (Princeton, 
            N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1979), pp. 118-36. And even those 
            attacks are hardly devastating. One can either refine the principle, 
            as Richard Arneson has done in &quot;The Principle of Fairness and 
            Free-Rider Problems,&quot; Ethics 92 (1982): 616-33; or, as in my 
            &quot;Nozick's Argument for the Legitimacy of the Welfare State,&quot; 
            Ethics 97 (1987): 576-94, show that Nozick's original criticism, and 
            most subsequent criticism, depends on examples that, upon careful 
            examination, fail to support the criticism. <br>
            <strong>9.</strong> I am not claiming that the engineers treated safety 
            as paramount because they knew what the ABET code said. When you ask 
            a lawyer about a professional code, she is likely to tell you she 
            studied the ABA code in law school and, claiming to have a copy around, 
            will produce it after only a few minutes of searching her desk or 
            bookshelves. When you ask an engineer the same question, he is likely 
            to tell you that his profession has a code while admitting both that 
            he never studied it and that he has none around to refer to. Yet, 
            anyone who has spent much time with working engineers knows they do 
            not treat safety in the same way managers do (hence Mason's plea to 
            &quot;take off your engineering hat&quot;). The engineers' code of 
            ethics seems to be &quot;hard-wired&quot; into them. Interestingly, 
            engineers are not the only professionals for whom the written code 
            seems to play so small a part. For another example, see my &quot;Vocational 
            Teachers, Confidentiality, and Professional Ethics,&quot; International 
            Journal of Applied Philosophy 4 (1988): 11-20. <br>
            <strong>10.</strong> I do not claim that he would explain his decision 
            in this way. Indeed, I think his explanation would be quite different, 
            though no less troubling. See my &quot;Explaining Wrongdoing,&quot; 
            Journal of Social Philosophy 20 (1989): 74-90. <br>
            <strong>11.</strong> Here, then, is why I reject the &quot;universalistic&quot; 
            interpretation of engineering ethics in, e.g., Kenneth Alpern, &quot;Moral 
            Responsibility for Engineers,&quot; Business and Professional Ethics 
            Journal 2 (1983): 39-48. <br>
            <strong>12.</strong> I am not here committing the &quot;originalist 
            fallacy&quot; common a few years back in debates over how to interpret 
            the U.S. Constitution. Though the first codes of ethics for American 
            engineers were adopted early in this century, all have undergone radical 
            revision within the last two decades. More importantly, as will be 
            made plain below, I use &quot;authors&quot; to include all those who 
            must currently support the code. My notion of interpretation is therefore 
            much closer to that found in Ronald Dworkin. Law's Empire (Cambridge, 
            Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1986). </p>
