    <p><a href="autonomy.html"><em>Autonomy </em></a><em>is a notable essay written 
      by IIT student Noe' Brambila in October, 1996 to fulfill an assignment for 
      a Moral Issues in Engineering course. The assignment asked &quot;How is 
      it possible (if it is ) to be self-directed and governed by a code of ethics?&quot;. 
      </em> </p>
          <p>A profession's code of ethics is by definition a set of minimal rules 
            of conduct to which the members of that profession should adhere. 
            These rules, as we have seen in class, stem from and seem very similar 
            to the moral standards that the general population follows. Just as 
            we see in everyday life, these standards of conduct are by no means 
            followed to the letter without exception. People in both cases under 
            their own power choose to follow these rules or not. With the exception 
            of crimes like murder and theft, in both cases those people choosing 
            not to behave morally and/or ethically run little chance of being 
            caught. <br>
            <br>
            People who are part of a profession choose to follow the code of ethics 
            of that profession of their own free will. In addition to the members 
            of a profession choosing to follow the code of ethics, these codes 
            are, as I mentioned, a minmum standard and by no means do the codes 
            dictate behavior. These codes suggest a set of ideas and goal that 
            one in a profession should work towards, and there fore they are not 
            coercive. For instance the NSPE's code of ethics states that engineers 
            shall "hold parrmount the safety, health, and welfare of the public 
            in the eprformance of their professional duties." In this canon there 
            is no suggestion of a specific action that should be either taken 
            or avoided. <br>
            <br>
            It then becomes possible to be &#0147;self-directed and governed by 
            a code of ethics&#0148; at the same time. The self-direction comes 
            from one's own moral beliefs and the obligation to the other people 
            within the same profession. The direction that the individual professionals 
            take is within their own judgment as long as they remain at least 
            within the bounds of the codes of ethics set forth by the profession. 
            The governing then becomes a self-imposed regulation thereby alleviating 
            the need for enforcement on the part of outside agencies.<br>
            <br>
            The code of ethics is then able to govern professional conduct without 
            stipulating penalties for failure to comply with the code because 
            the members of the profession enter the profession willingly and therefore 
            accept the code of ethics, likewise, willingly. The story of the Fifty-Nine 
            Story Crisis serves as an example of professionals who willingly accept 
            the codes of ethics established by professions. William Measure was 
            under no obligation to either the city, his employers or anyone else, 
            yet he took on the task of reevaluating the design of the building 
            to assess any weakensses that might have been overlooked. Measure's 
            actions were not mandated by law and his code of ethics did not outline 
            a specific response to the situation in which he found himself.<br>
            <br>
            It is then easy to see that beign governed by a code of ethics is 
            not equivalent to beign subject to the dictates to others. Professionals 
            are always free to choose how they will act in the performance of 
            their professional duties. These professionals are only subject to 
            their own decision making and therefore responsible for their own 
            actions. This means that the choices they make are indeed based on 
            reasons of their own and not on the specific orders outlined by others.</p>
