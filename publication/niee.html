	<p> <strong><a href="http://hum.iit.edu:8080/aire/sea/1/book/index.html">Code
	      Making: How Software Engineering Became a Profession</a>.</strong> During
	      the period of 1993-2000, CSEP fellows and staff were participant observers
	      in a joint project of the IEEE Computer Society
      (IEEE-CS) and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) f
      to
      help
      organize
      software developers and engineers into a profession. One of the main goals
      of this project was to develop a universal code of ethics for software
      engineers.  Dr. Davis was a participant
      observer
      throughout
      the drafting
      of
      the
      Software Engineering
      Code of Ethics, and afterwards
	      wrote a detailed account of how the code was developed by the ACM and
	      IEEE-CS committee. “Code Making” gives insight in how the profession of
	      software engineering was formed and wrote its own code of professional
	      ethics, and also looks at this project as a case study to see how other
	      professional societies can better go about drafting and revising their
	      own codes of ethics. The

      <p> <strong>Trying Times: Science and Responsibilities after Daubert</strong>.
         Can judges make responsible decisions about what scientific evidence
        is 
        admissible in court? When is expert witnessing unethical? How can courts
         respect scientific standards while pursuing justice? These are some
        of 
        the questions that direct attention to responsibilities of the professionals
         in legal cases requiring evidence from experts. These responsibilities
        
        are the concern of a recent publication, <u>Trying Times: Science and
        Responsibilities after <em>Daubert</em></u>, produced by the Center for
        the Study of Ethics in the Professions (CSEP) at Illinois Institute of
        Technology
         (IIT) in 
        collaboration with the Institute for Science, Law and Technology (ISLAT)
          at IIT's Chicago-Kent College of Law. The volume includes essays by
         Barbara 
        Jacobs Rothstein, a federal judge, Richard Meserve, a former litigator
          in high stakes cases involving scientific testimony, Sheila Jasanoff
         (Science 
        and Public Policy, Harvard), and Ullica Segerstrale (Social Science,
         IIT).  The editor, Vivian Weil, has an introductory essay. An annotated
         bibliography 
        acquaints readers with the lively literature since the Supreme Court's
          1993 decision in Daubert that made judges gatekeepers for admitting
         science 
        in the courts. The volume is aimed to clarify the responsibilities of
          judges, lawyers, scientists, engineers, and researchers in medicine
         at 
        this intersection of law and science. </p>

        <strong>Professional Ethics and Engineering: A Resource Guide</strong> 
        (2nd ed.). The Guide was compiled by the Center for the National Institute 
        for Engineering Ethics (NIEE), with funding from NIEE. The Guide is updated 
        from the 1990 version which was also produced by CSEP for NIEE (then an 
        entity within the National Society of Professional Engineers). It consists 
        of four sections: a bibliography, a listing of engineering ethics organizations 
        and centers, a list of key educational and popular films relating to engineering 
        ethics, and a list of key resource professionals in engineering ethics. 
        The Guide also appears freely online on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.niee.org/resource.htm">NIEE 
        homepage</a>. </p>

        Option</strong>.<br>
        Published in Sept. 1997, these practical and ethical guidelines highlight 
        correct management of the privatization process. This project, funded 
        by the Joyce Foundation, was the joint effort of CSEP and the National 
        League of Cities.</p>
      <p>The cost for either of these publications is $10.00 per copy, plus $3.00
