		<h2>2000 Sample Cases </h2>
		<p> </p>
		<p><strong>Case 1</strong> <br>
		  In Alaska about half of the State's native population of 100,000 people
		    live partially or entirely off the land. Several thousand Alaskan
		    Native Americans depend upon fishing, hunting, and gathering for more than
		    ninety
		    per-cent of their food supply. About two thirds of Alaska's lands
		    are owned by the federal government but managed by the State. In the summer
		    of 1999
		    U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced that the federal
		    government would take over the allocation of fishing rights in federally
		    owned sections
		    of Alaska unless the State legislature agreed by October 1, 1999
		    upon an amendment to the State Constitution which would guarantee a &quot;subsistence
		    priority&quot; in times of shortage to native peoples who live primarily
		    off the land in Alaska. The State legislature was unable to reach
	    agreement upon such an Amendment by October 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </p>
		<p>Title VIII of the Alaska
		      Natural Interest Lands Conservation Act, which
		    Congress passed in 1980, contained a provision which assured that
		  in years of low yield Native American Alaskans who live off the land would
		      have priority
		    rights in regard to fishing and hunting. About ten years ago the
		  Supreme
		    Court of Alaska ruled that this provision violates Alaska's State
		  Constitution. Since that time the federal government has urged the State
		  to change
		    its Constitution. This past summer Secretary Babbitt expressed disappointment
		    that the State legislature had not yet brought the issue before voters,
		    and
		    announced it was time for the federal government to act. </p>
		<p>Subsistence
		    fishing and hunting involve two to three per-cent of the State's
		  fish and game annually, and the issue of allocating priority rights
		    arises only every few years, when fish run low in some streams or
		  caribou herds thin. Nonetheless, the issue is complicated. In some cases
		  streams
		    have been closed off for weeks to everyone except subsistence fishermen,
		    which not only upsets those who fish for sport, but also can make
		  the difference between profit and loss for some commercial fishing operations.
		    There are
		    also issues of who qualifies as a subsistence fisherman or hunter.
		    Some non-native Alaskans live off the land, and many Native Americans
		  Alaskans
		    live in Anchorage
		    or Fairbanks, where they shop in supermarkets and eat at McDonalds.
		    Even the Native Americans who depend upon fishing, hunting, and gathering
		    for
		    ninety per-cent of their food supply commonly own motorboats, snowmobiles,
		    and satellite television dishes. </p>
		<p>The issue of allocating priority rights has elicited strong emotional responses
		  throughout Alaska. In the words of George Irvine, Director of the Alaskan
		  Federation of Natives: &quot;This is not 19th century history here, some
		  historical injustice we can do nothing about today. These are the last aboriginal
		  Americans still striving to live as they always have, on their homelands.
		  There has to be room in the American system for them to survive.&quot; On
		  the other side of the issue, the Alaskan Outdoors Council, a group representing
		  sportsman and sportswomen, of whom many were born in Alaska, decries as &quot;special
		  rights legislation&quot; the efforts to establish priority fishing and hunting
		  rights for native peoples in the State. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Question:</strong> Do native American Alaskans, who live primarily off the
            land, have a moral right to a subsistence priority in regard to hunting
            and fishing on federally owned lands in Alaska? If so, why? If not,
            why not? <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Case 2 </strong><br>
            Jane and Mary, two young women in their early twenties, have been
            close friends since they met during their second year of college.
            The now both live in the same city where each is pursuing her career,
            Mary as a teacher and Jane as a computer systems analyst. Jane's
            current boy friend Sam frequently borrows money from her. Jane has
            complained to Mary several times about not having enough money to
            buy things, but, as Mary observes, she (Jane) never presses Sam to
            pay her back. Last week Jane lent her car to Sam for a period of
            two weeks so that he could visit some college friends out of town.
            Jane doesn't need her car to get to work, but not having the car
            on weekends has meant she will have to put off several shopping trips
            to furnish her new apartment. It also seems to Mary, from what Jane
            told her, that Sam was a little vague to her about the identities
            of the people he plans to visit. </p>
		<p>Jane has told Mary that she considers
              Sam one of the most intelligent and creative persons she has ever
              known. Mary has met Sam several
              times. He talks constantly about grandiose plans for different
		  business ventures, but has yet to follow through on any of them. Sam has
		  no
              steady job at this time, and, so far as Mary can determine, doesn't
              seem terribly concerned about this. </p>
		<p>Mary recalls well that Jane also
              considered her boy friend in her junior year of college, Gary,
		  a graduate student in biology, as exceptionally
              bright. Gary had a difficult relationship with his thesis adviser,
              about which he bitterly complained to Jane almost daily, often
		  for well over an hour. Mary recalls that Jane endured Gary's non-stop
              venting of frustration, discouragement, and anger without ever
		  saying anything to Gary about the emotional strain it caused her (about
              which she often complained to Mary). Mary also remembers that Gary
              proved completely unable, or unwilling, to extend emotional support
              to Jane, even in situations where she needed it badly. For example
              during a very tense period when Jane and her family feared that
		  her mother might have cancer, and were awaiting test results (fortunately
              they turned out to be negative for cancer), Gary continued to go
              on about his adviser completely oblivious to Jane's situation.
		  Eventually
              Gary ended the relationship and very shortly thereafter became
		  involved with another young woman. </p>
		<p>Mary has the highest regard for Jane. She
              considers her a superb friend, and a responsible, caring person.
              Mary believes that Jane
              is extremely bright, interesting, and capable. She also views Jane
              as very sensitive, however. During all the years of their friendship
              Mary has never said anything to Jane that Jane could understand
		  as strongly critical of her. </p>
		<p><strong>Question:</strong> What should Mary do, and why?<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Case 3 </strong><br>
            Shawn and Kevin, two young men in their mid-twenties, have been close
            friends since they met during their college years. They share numerous
            similar interests and greatly enjoy each other's company. Kevin gratefully
            acknowledges to himself that Shawn has been a fine friend in every
            respect that counts. Shawn has listened patiently, and responded
            empathetically, on the many occasions Kevin sought him out to talk
            about major issues in his life concerning, for example, school plans,
            job opportunities, or romantic matters. Shawn has always been there
            when Kevin needed encouragement. He has provided assistance unselfishly
            in large and small matters - e.g. lending Kevin his car when Kevin's
            broke down, several times helping Kevin move his belongings from
            one apartment to another, and putting up Kevin's relatives from out
            of town when Kevin didn't have room for them at this apartment. This
            is not to say, however, that the friendship has been one sided in
            any way. Kevin has provided similar kinds of support, encouragement,
            and assistance to Shawn over the years. Kevin does not view all the
            things he and Shawn have done for one another as at all like a sequence
            of quid pro quos, but instead (although Kevin has never consciously
            stated the point in this way to himself) he views the deep reciprocity
            between Shawn and himself as flowing organically from the nature
            of their friendship. </p>
		<p>Shawn, who has written a number of short stories
              and poems, has been working on his first novel for the past two
		  years. Kevin is well
              aware of Shawn's first major literary project and fully supports
              it, in the sense of considering it a highly worthwhile thing for
              Shawn to do. Several weeks ago Shawn learned about a small house
              in a quiet semi-rural outer suburban area. He believes the house
              would provide an ideal working environment for him. </p>
		<p>Recently Shawn
              has asked Kevin to loan him $5,000 for the down payment on the
		  house. The request takes Kevin by surprise. Over the years
              of their friendship neither Kevin nor Shawn has asked the other
		  for a loan until now. Monetary affairs have not played a significant
              role in their relationship as friends, either directly or indirectly.
              Kevin and Shawn both grew up in families where discussion of personal
              financial issues outside of the family was disapproved of strongly.
              For this reason, both Kevin and Shawn seldom, if ever, discuss
		  their personal finances with each other. </p>
		<p>Kevin, who works as a project
              manager for a large engineering firm, can afford to loan the money
              to Shawn. He (Kevin) is not sure, however,
              exactly how Shawn plans to repay the loan on his salary as manager
              of a small bookstore. Kevin feels acutely uncomfortable raising
		  issues with Shawn such as how he plans to repay the loan, what might be
              a reasonable repayment schedule, and so forth. </p>
		<p><strong>Question: </strong>What should Kevin do, and why? <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Case 4 </strong><br>
            In early 1982 Ms. Corrine Worthen, a registered nurse, protested
            against assignment to perform kidney dialysis upon a terminally ill
            patient who was a double amputee. She notified her head nurse that
            she &quot;had moral, medical, and philosophical objections&quot; against
            doing so. Prior to her protest Ms. Worthen had performed the procedure
            on the patient and twice had to interrupt it because the patient
            suffered cardiac arrest and severe hemorrhaging. Convinced that the
            procedure was more harmful than beneficial to the patient, Ms. Worthen
            asked to be reassigned. The head nurse granted her request. </p>
		<p>Several
              months later, however, Ms. Worthen again was called upon to dialyze
              the patient. She objected, stating that she thought she
              had worked out an agreement not to be given this assignment. The
              head nurse referred Ms. Worthen to the treating physician who informed
              her that the patient's family wanted the patient kept alive, and
              that the patient would soon cease to live without dialysis. Nonetheless,
              Ms. Worthen said she refused to dialyze the patient anymore. The
              head nurse then warned her that she would be fired if she continued
              in her refusal. Ms. Worthen continued to refuse to dialyze the
		  patient, and she was terminated. </p>
		<p>The Code of Professional Ethics for Nurses,
              that applied to Ms. Worthen at the time she was fired, contained
              a provision with the following
              words:</p>
		<p> 
		  1.4 THE NATURE OF HEALTH PROBLEMS <br>
		  The nurse's respect for the worth and dignity of the individual human
            being applies irrespective of the nature of the health problem. It
            is reflected in the care given the person who is disabled as well
            as the normal, the patient with the long-term illness as well as
            the one with acute illness, or the recovering patient as well as
            the one
            who who is terminally ill or dying. &#8230;. </p>
		<p>If personally opposed to the delivery of care in a particular case because
		  of the nature of the health problem or the procedures to be used, the
		  nurse is justified in refusing to participate. Such refusal should be made
		  known
		  in advance and in time for other appropriate arrangements to be made
		  for the client's nursing care.If the nurse must knowingly enter such a case
		  under emergency
		  circumstances or enters unknowingly, the obligation to provide the
		  best possible care is observed. The nurse withdraws from this kind
		  of situation only when
		  assured that alternative sources of nursing care are available to the
		  client. </p>

            <strong>Case 5 </strong><br>
            The use of firecrackers is a prominent ritual in many traditional
            celebrations of the Chinese New Year. For the past three years, however,
            the administration of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has refused
            to allow the setting off of firecrackers in Chinese New Year celebrations.
            Citing safety considerations, a spokesperson for the Mayor's office
            recently noted an Associated Press report of a firecracker storage
            area in China that caught fire, resulting in the deaths of forty
            seven people. Opponents of the Giuliani administration's policy say
            they simply want to be allowed to use firecrackers in specially designated
            areas under close city supervision. They point out that such procedures
            are used in large public fireworks displays on the Fourth of July,
            which to their knowledge, have not resulted in any deaths or serious
            injuries. The opponents of the firecracker ban emphasize the enormous
            cultural significance for many of the Chinese people living in New
            York City of celebrating the Chinese New Year in a traditional manner
            that includes using firecrackers. </p>
		<p>In February of 1998 Mr. Wang Jian,
            a twenty eight year old former U.S. Marine, set off a string of firecrackers
            on the steps of New
            York City's City Hall. Seconds later he walked down the steps and
            calmly allowed himself to be handcuffed by police officers who arrested
            him. Mr. Wang was charged with four misdemeanor counts, including
            reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct, and one count of an
            administrative code violation, unreasonable noise. Released on $500
            bail, he faced, possibly, up to a year in prison and a fine of $1,000. &quot;I
            did it to make a political statement,&quot; said Mr. Wang. &quot;I
            wanted the politicians to know that the Chinese will stand up for
            what they believe in.&quot; </p>
		<p>Upon his release Mr. Wang received a
            hero's reception from many residents of New York's Chinatown. &quot;He
            did what many of us didn't have the courage to. &#8230;. He is not
            only my hero, but a hero for the whole community, said Mr. Thomas
            Lee, a businessman who waited in
            line in a Chinatown restaurant to shake Mr. Wang's hand shortly after
            he was released on bail.. Restaurant owners in New York's Chinatown
            offered Mr. Wang free meals, local businessmen offered to contribute
            money towards his legal defense, and even police officers showed
            deference towards him. </p>
		<p>Some members of the Chinese community in New
            York, however, were critical of Mr. Wang's action. Mr. Richard Hsueh,
            President of Chinese
            American Voice, a radio station in Flushing, expressed the opinion
            that Mr. Wang went too far in expressing his point. &quot;I do not
            have any problems with a safe legalized fireworks display, &#8230;.
            But [Mr. Wang] should not have done what he did, It's dangerous,&quot; said
            Mr. Hsueh. </p>
		<p>Mr. Wang said that before setting off the firecrackers
            on the steps of New York's City Hall, he made sure the steps were
            empty. &quot;Public
            safety was the most important thing in my mind that moment,&quot; he
            said. </p>
		<p><strong>Question:</strong> Was Wang Jian's protest against the ban on use
		  of firecrackers to celebrate the Chinese New Year in New York City morally
		  unjustifiable?
            If so, why? If not, why not? <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Case 6 </strong><br>
            In 1967 Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, then a strong contender
            for the middleweight boxing championship, was convicted with a co-defendant,
            Mr. John Artis, of murdering a bartender and two patrons in a sudden
            attack of gunfire on a tavern in Patterson, New Jersey. After a twenty
            year legal struggle, Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis had their convictions
            overturned. This struggle is the subject of a recent film entitled
            The Hurricane, starring Denzel Washington, and directed by Norman
            Jewison. </p>
		<p>At the trial of Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis in 1967 the prosecution
              introduced no motive. The only witnesses who testified for the
		  prosecution were two petty criminals, who admitted to having committed a
		  burglary
              near the scene of the crime, and claimed to see Mr. Carter and
		  Mr. Artis emerge from the scene of the crime holding guns. Sentenced
              to life imprisonment, Mr. Carter undertook relentless efforts to
              overturn the conviction. In 1973 he was able to secure the help
		  of a lawyer in the New Jersey Public Defender's Office and a free lance
              journalist, who continued the search for evidence. In 1974 the
		  attorney, and a reporter for the New York Times tracked down the two petty
              criminals, who separately recanted their testimony, claiming they
              had been pressured into it by the prosecutors. Mr. Carter's case
              became an international cause celebre, with Bob Dylan writing and
              performing a song about it. </p>
		<p>The New Jersey Supreme Court overturned
              Mr. Carter's and Mr. Artis' convictions. After only ninety days
		  of freedom, however, in 1976
              the prosecution brought the case to trial again, this time contending
              that Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis, who are both African-American, had
              been motivated by racial vengeance. The murders in the tavern had
              occurred only shortly after an African-American tavern owner in
		  Patterson, New Jersey had been killed by a white assailant. One of the petty
              criminals from the original trial took the stand again and recanted
              his recantation. Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis were reconvicted and
		  returned
              to prison. </p>
		<p>Although the international attention to the case faded,
              the lawyers who represented Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis at the second
              trial continued
              to work on their behalf for over ten years without pay, eventually
              unearthing key evidence that the prosecution had suppressed at
		  the second trial. During this period a commune of social activists from
              Canada became interested in Mr. Carter's case and established communication
              with him. The commune members provided Mr. Carter important emotional,
              moral, and financial support to continue the struggle to gain his
              freedom. In 1985, after nine years of unsuccessful appeals in State
              court, Mr. Carter's attorneys persuaded a federal judge to overturn
              Mr. Carter's and Mr. Artis' convictions. In 1988 the U.S. Supreme
              Court upheld the decision of the federal judge. </p>
		<p>Film makers have
              always taken dramatic license by simplifying history, and even
		  conflating characters and events for narrative purposes,
              while striving to retain the essential truth with respect to the
              subject matter of a film. This is often difficult. In The Hurricane
              Mr. Carter's and Mr. Artis' two trials are compressed into a brief
              courtroom scene. No mention is made of the testimony of the two
		  petty criminals. The film leaves Mr. Artis almost completely out of the
              story even though, in reality, with great moral heroism, he defiantly
              rejected an offer to avoid a long prison sentence by falsely incriminating
              Mr. Carter. The Hurricane depicts members of the Canadian commune
              as uncovering vital evidence. In reality, although the commune
		  members did useful para-legal work, as noted above, Mr. Carter's attorneys
              unearthed the critical evidence that lead to the setting aside
		  in
              federal court of Mr. Carter's and Mr. Artis' convictions. In The
              Hurricane there is a racist detective intent on keeping Mr. Carter
              behind bars, who, in one dramatic scene, almost succeeds in causing
              the deaths of several commune members. All of this was purely fictitious.
              There was no actual person corresponding to the racist detective
              in the film. </p>
		<p><strong>Question: </strong>Were the decisions made by the makers of the film Hurricane, in
		  connection with telling the story of Rubin Carter's struggle for freedom,
		  morally objectionable, specifically in not including certain true details
		  of the story, and adding certain fictional elements to the plot? If so, why?
		  If not, why not?<br>

            <strong>Case 7 </strong><br>
            Carl Y is the Director of Z Museum, a major art museum on the east
            coast of the United States. Carl badly wants to bring to Z Museum
            an exhibit of works by young British artists that recently concluded
            a very successful show at a museum in London. Carl is familiar with
            the works of many of the artists, and considers them among the most
            interesting on the contemporary art scene. </p>
		<p>Unfortunately the transportation
              and installation costs are immense. One piece of sculpture in the
              London show, for example, weighs several
              tons. Government support for the arts has declined substantially
              in recent years, so Carl concludes that in order to bring the show
              to Z Museum he needs to find a private donor who will help him
		  cover the costs. All the works in the show in London belong to a British
              art collector named Jeremy Q. Carl proposes to Jeremy that he make
              a large donation to help the Z Museum put on the exhibition, and
              Jeremy agrees to do so. </p>
		<p>After agreeing to support the exhibit at
              Z Museum, Jeremy persuades M's, a prestigious auction house, to
		  co-sponsor the exhibit, as it
              did in London. To persuade M's Jeremy tells Henry P, President
		  of M's British division, that he plans a major sale of works in his
              collection later in the year after the exhibit at Z Museum has
		  concluded, and that he might use M's as the auctioneer. At about the time
		  that
              Jeremy says this to Henry P., Carl Y has a lunch meeting with Anne
              S, President of M's North American division. Carl tells Anne that
              Z Museum is considering a significant program to sell its holdings
              in all collection categories, especially modern art, which happens
              to be M's specialty. </p>
		<p>As planning for the show at Z Museum proceeds,
              Jeremy Q proves to be very demanding and opinionated with respect
              to artistic details.
              He insists that the paintings be hung low, and he doesn't want
		  labels affixed too closely to them. The Museum staff wants to eliminate
              some paintings from the show, but Jeremy strongly urges their inclusion.
              Some of Jeremy's requests are expensive. He wants Z Museum to use
              special shipping crates, he insists that the galleries be repainted,
              and he wants Z. Museum to pay $20,000 for bringing his special
		  installation consultant to the Museum for several weeks. </p>
		<p>Carl Y and the Z Museum
              staff go along with most of Jeremy Q's wishes. They consider him,
              after all, as probably the most knowledgeable
              person in the world about contemporary British art. Jeremy, however,
              is also interested in attracting corporate sponsorship for his
		  collection. In this regard consultants tell him that a successful show at
		  Z Museum
              would be highly advantageous. When the exhibit opens, Jeremy Q's
              financial support is not made public. </p>
		<p>The Code of Ethics for Museum
            Directors says that Directors should &quot;assiduously
            avoid&quot; activities that compromise their institutions. On the
            subject of exhibition financing, the Code only contains two vague
            sentences that say a Director should not compromise standards for
            the sake of revenue. </p>
		<p><strong>Question: </strong>Assume that Musuem Z's exhibit of works by young British artists
		  takes place, and it is now one year later. The Ethics Committee of the Museum
		  Director's Association is meeting to consider revisions in the Museum Director's
		  Code of Ethics. You are a member of the Ethics Committee. Do you have any
		  recommendations to put forward for revising the Code of Ethics in connection
		  with the subject of exhibition financing? If so, what are your recommendations,
		  and why? If not, why not? <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Case 8 </strong><br>
            In October of 1999 the government of Canada agreed to pay 2.3 billion
            dollars to 230,000 federal workers, both current and retired, in
            the form of back pay with interest, to conform with the principle
            of &quot;equal pay for work of equal value&quot; embodied in Canada's
            Human Rights Act. The drafters of this law, enacted more than twenty
            years ago, noted that the vast majority of women in the workforce
            in Canada were clustered in a small number of &quot;women's&quot; jobs,
            such as office worker, nurse, or waitress. Women in these jobs, the
            drafters of Canada's Human Rights Act observed, usually receive less
            pay than men in predominantly male jobs, which, despite their higher
            salaries, are comparable to the predominantly female jobs in terms
            of factors such as the mental or physical demands of the job, working
      conditions, or educational prerequisites. </p>
	  <p>To address this situation, the government of Canada organized a committee
		  made up of employees and managers drawn from various Canadian federal
	    government departments to develop a numerically based system for comparing
	    predominantly
		  male and predominantly female jobs. The committee rated a wide array
	    of jobs in terms of four factors: educational prerequisites, job responsibilities,
		  mental demands, and on the job working conditions. The committee determined
		  that &quot;male&quot; jobs tended strongly to have higher salaries than female
		  jobs at the same point levels. For example, a chief librarian made
		  $35,050 while a dairy herd improvement manager made $38,766. A computer operations
		  supervisor made $20,193, while a forestry project supervisor made $26,947.
		  A typist made $10,531, while a sailor made $14,097. In all of the above
		  instances
		  the predominantly female and the predominantly male jobs were determined
		  to have comparable point levels. </p>
	  <p>The Canadian government's 2.3 billion
		  dollar settlement has drawn strong criticism. Monte Solberg, a Reform
	    Party member of the Canadian Parliament
		  lamented that &quot;[t]o come up with some concept where a bunch of bureaucrats
		  arbitrarily decide, based on some abstract theory, that one job that
		  women dominate is somehow the same as another completely different
		  job that men
		  dominate - it's unworkable.&quot; Other critics protest that the settlement
		  will increase the taxes in Canada, whose taxpayers already shoulder
		  the highest tax burden among the Group of Seven industrialized nations. </p>
	  <p>Defenders
		    of the Canadian government's settlement view it as needed
		    to rectify, what they consider, the discriminatory impact upon female
		    workers of the Canadian government's employment compensation policies
	    over many years.
		    Even if the lower wages for predominantly female jobs reflect going
		    market salary rates, say the supporters of the settlement, these
	    market rates themselves
		    reflect pervasive discrimination against women in the workforce.
	    Furthermore, the supporters of the settlement contest that the settlement
	    will have
		    a severely negative impact upon the Canadian economy. In this regard,
	    Daryl Bean, President of the Canadian federal service union, estimated that
		    over
		    40% of the 2.3 billion would be returned as taxes to the government. </p>
	  <p><strong>Question: </strong>Is the October 1999 settlement of the Government
	    of Canada, under the &quot;equal pay for work of equal value&quot; principle of Canada's
		  Human Rights Act, morally justifiable? If so, why? If not, why not? <br>

          <strong>Case 9 </strong><br>
          MP3 audio files enable users to exchange compact disk recordings digitally
          over the Internet. Music lovers use MP3's to search for rare recordings.
          They also can use them to copy an entire compact disk and transmit
          it to anyone at no cost. Recently the Recording Industry Association
          of America (RIAA) has undertaken a major effort to combat copyright
          violations. The RIAA sends letters to colleges and universities whenever
          its researchers discover on campus servers offering copyrighted music.
          According to Frank Creighton, an RIAA Senior Vice President, when the
          Association began its monitoring efforts several years ago it discovered
          that about seventy per-cent of the infringing sites were on university
          campuses. &quot;&#8230;We're willing to give individuals or students
          a first pass,&quot; said Mr. Creighton. &quot;But if we catch you doing
          it again,&quot; he said, &quot;we have no alternative but to take the
          stance that you're thumbing your nose at us, and you don't take us
          seriously, and there are potential civil and criminal remedies that
          we will invoke if we need to.&quot; </p>
	  <p>In the fall of 1999 network administrators
          at Carnegie Mellon University, without prior warning, checked the public
          folders of two hundred and
          fifty (250) student computers connected to the University's network,
          and found seventy one (71) students whose files contained illegally
          copied MP3's. The students lost their in-room Internet connections
          for the rest of the semester, which meant they had to use a university
          computer lab to gain access to the Internet. All the students were
          given a right to appeal their penalties, and students who attended
          a ninety minute class on copyright had their penalties reduced by one
          month. Speaking of the investigation, Paul G. Fowler, Carnegie Mellon's
          Associate Dean for Student Affairs said, &quot;It wasn't a big caper.
          All we did was go in to take a look at the culture of our Internet.&quot; Mr.
          Fowler noted that prior to the investigation, University officials
          had discussed whether it would be a good idea to step up efforts at
          educating students about copyright violations. &quot;We now know it
          would be,&quot; he said. </p>
	  <p>Under the Digital Millenium Act, which Congress
            passed last year, on-line service providers, such as universities,
            can avoid liability if they
            take certain steps specified in the Act. These include, in cases
	    when the university has been informed of an infringement, shutting off access
            to the infringing material, and notifying the user who posted it,
	    so
            that he or she can take up the matter with the copyright holder.
	    The user must be given the right by the university to appeal the shutoff.
            According to Mr. Arnold Lutzker, an attorney for the American Library
            Association, if a university meets the above requirements, in all
	    likelihood,
            it will avoid liability for any given infringement. </p>
	  <p>&quot;
        I'm no fan of the recording industry,&quot; said Mr. Fowler of Carnegie
          Mellon, &quot;but our students need to understand they're probably
          going to be out there creating software some day that's going to make
          them a million dollars.&quot; If that software winds up in some shared
          community,&quot; Mr. Fowler observed, &quot;their livelihood is jeopardized.&quot; &quot;So
          why should we not afford the same opportunities to make a living to
          other members of our community?&quot;, asked Mr. Fowler. </p>
	  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Was the action taken this fall by Carnegie-Mellon University in
		  regard to the students who the University concluded had illegally copied
		  MP3's morally justifiable? If so, why? If not, why not? </p>
		<p> <br>
		  <strong>Case 10 </strong><br>
		  Country X, located in Latin America, has recently adopted a policy
		  of strictly limiting the collection of biological specimens, both plant
		  and animal, within its borders. Under the new regulations individual scientists
		  and companies must apply for permits that, in one case, cost $600,000,
		  and
		  can take more than three years to obtain. Formerly Country X had no
		  policy in regard to collection of biological specimens for research by foreign
		  scientists.
		  During the 1950's and 1960's a major American drug company developed
		  two drugs that turned out to be effective for treating certain types of cancer
		  from plants found in the jungles of Country X. Country X did not share
		  at
		  all in the Company's profit. </p>
		<p>John R, a scientist with the National
		    Institute of Health in Washington, DC, believes that experimentation
		  with another native plant of Country
		    X could lead to a significant breakthrough in regard to treatment
		  of other kinds of cancers. He has been waiting for Country X to process his
		    permit
		    application for two and a half years now, and fears the plant may
		  become
		    extinct by the time he obtains permission to collect it. </p>
		<p>Other nations,
		    which, like Country X, historically did not restrain the collecting
		  of biological specimens within their borders, have begun
		    to impose such restrictions. One driving factor in this regard is
		  the perception of many nations that genetic engineering has significantly
		  increased
		    the
		    potential for commercial use of genes. For example, researchers at
		    the University of Wisconsin have isolated a substance 2,000 times
		  sweeter than sugar from
		    a West African berry. If a table sweetener is developed from this
		  substance it would be produced, in all likelihood, in genetically modified
		  bacteria,
		    which would eliminate the need to use the berry. Another driving
		  factor in the new restrictive policies of several nations is the patenting
		    of genetically
		    modified plants and animals in the United States, which has been
		  allowed
		    since 1980 under a major decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. Some
		  nations take the stance that if, for example, a company genetically engineers
		    a seed
		    taken from a farmer's field, patents the engineered seed, and makes
		    a profit, then, in all fairness, the company should pay substantially
		    for the original
		    seed. </p>
		<p>Many scientists agree with the preceding point of view in principle,
		    but complain that existing rules are much too restrictive. One study,
		    conducted by researchers at Columbia University, concluded that in
		    the Philippines, since that nation enacted its permit regulations
		  in 1995, only two
		    permits
		    have been granted out of thirty seven applications. Drug companies
		    contend that some nations overestimate the value of raw genetic resources.
		    They note,
		    in this regard, that in developing a drug a company may have to invest
		    $500 million dollars over fifteen years. </p>
		<p>At the Earth Summit in Rio De Janiero
		  in 1992, a convention on bio-diversity
		  was developed which states that nations have sovereignty over their
		  genetic resources, and are entitled to &quot;fair and equitable sharing of
		  their benefits.&quot; The Clinton Administration supports the bio-diversity
		  convention, but the U.S. Senate has never ratified it. </p>

          <strong>Case 11 </strong><br>
          On September 17, 1999 a fight broke out in the stands during a football
          game at Eisenhower High School in Decatur, Illinois. The fight disrupted
          the game. About half of the nearby spectators scattered to avoid getting
          hurt. The fight, however, involved no weapons and resulted in no serious
          injuries to anyone. Six Eisenhower students who had taken part in the
          fight (which had been recorded on videotape), all African American,
          were immediately suspended. Shortly thereafter a hearing took place
          at which the students were presented with the charges against them
          and given an opportunity to respond. In late October the Decatur School
          Board voted, with only one dissent, from the sole African American
          member of the School Board, to expel the six students for a period
          of two years. <br>
          In August of 1998 the Decatur School Board had adopted a resolution
          which declared a &quot;no tolerance position on school violence.&quot; In
          most other school districts a two year expulsion would be imposed only
          in the most grave kinds of disciplinary infractions. For example, of
          the three students expelled for two years in the Chicago Public Schools
          during 1999, one was charged with attempted murder (with a gun) off
          campus, another charged with aggravated battery off campus, and the
          third allegedly threatened in school to cut a student's throat with
          a pair of scissors. </p>
		<p>The decision of the Decatur School Board to expel
            the six students for two years generated immense controversy. Reverend
            Jesse Jackson,
            and other members of the Push/Rainbow Coalition, which he leads,
		  came to Decatur to take up the students' cause. In early November Illinois
            Governor George Ryan and State Superintendent of Public Instruction
            Max McGee met with the Decatur School Board and Jesse Jackson in
		  an
            effort to defuse the situation. Superintendent McGee proposed that
            the students be given an opportunity to receive alternative schooling
            while expelled (the Decatur School Board's expulsion order had made
            no such provision). He also suggested that the students be allowed
            to apply for readmission at the end of the fall semester contingent
            upon satisfactory academic work and conduct in the alternative school
            setting. Jesse Jackson, on behalf of the students, indicated that
		  he considered Superintendent McGee's suggestions fair and reasonable.
            The Decatur School Board rejected them but, owing to intense persuasive
            efforts by Governor Ryan, reduced the expulsion order to one year,
            with provision of alternative schooling. </p>
		<p>Jesse Jackson made it clear
          that the six students, their families, and their supporters in the
          community, which included many of the African
          American residents of Decatur, viewed the School Board's response as
          unacceptable. He denounced the &quot;zero tolerance&quot; position
          on school violence in Decatur as the latest in a series of vindictively
          harsh policies directed at young people throughout the United States.
          Jackson called attention to the fact that not long before the fight
          that took place on September 17, 1999, a student at Roosevelt Junior
          High School in Decatur, who had made a bomb threat, received a suspension
          of only a few days. Jackson also pointed to statistics indicating that
          of the last fifty seven students expelled from Decatur public schools,
          forty seven had been African American. <br>
          Push/Rainbow Coalition attorneys filed a lawsuit in federal court protesting
          the expulsion of the six students. On January 12, 2000 a federal judge
          in Urbana, Illinois issued a decision that upheld in every respect
          the action taken by the Decatur School Board. </p>
		<p><strong>Question:</strong> Was the decision of the federal judge on January 12, 2000 upholding
		  the action taken by the Decatur School Board in regard to the expulsion of
		  the six students involved in the fight at the football game morally justifiable?
		  If so, why? If not, why not? </p>
