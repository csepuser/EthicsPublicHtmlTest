		<p><br>
            <strong>Case 1</strong><br>
  Ryoei Saito, former chairperson of Daishowa Paper, paid a record price for
  two art masterpieces: Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet ($82.5 million), and
  Renoir&#8217;s Le Moulin de la Galette ($78.1 million). The Van Gogh, which
  hung in Frankfurt's St&auml;dtische Galerie, had previously been hidden from
  the public for several years when, in 1933, the museum&#8217;s director correctly
  anticipated the destruction of &#8220;degenerate&#8221; Expressionist art that
  would occur under Nazi rule. Hermann Goering tracked down the work in 1937
  and sold it for $53,000. The Kramarsky family later purchased the painting,
  and brought it with them to New York when they fled Nazi Germany. The Kramarsky
  family frequently loaned the work for display at the Metropolitan Museum. </p>
		<p>After purchasing the paintings in 1990, Saito had them shipped to a secret
		  climate-controlled storeroom in the Tokyo area, where he viewed the paintings
		  for a few hours, then had them packed and locked securely away. Saito would
		  not even allow his family to see the paintings. Over the next seven years,
		  the paintings were taken out of storage only once, for a dinner at a restaurant
		  where Saito entertained a guest from Sotheby's Auction House. </p>
		<p>The sale of such significant works to a private individual and their removal
		  from public access caused controversy. However, this controversy was minor
		  compared to the uproar that ensued when Saito declared his intention to have
		  the paintings cremated with him when he died. The paintings were saved from
		  destruction only when they were used as collateral against Saito&#8217;s
		  loans from Fuji Bank. </p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p><strong>Case 2</strong><br>
  Computers fail for many reasons; most commonly, because of a hard drive crash.
    Computers may also be rendered unusable by fire, flood, mistreatment, sabotage,
    rust, viruses, overheating, static electric shock, and other mishaps. Users
    sometimes lose data by forgetting a password, deleting data accidentally,
    or making other mistakes. Even the savviest user will sometimes neglect to
    back up important data. When catastrophe occurs, the data stored on the hard
    drive, though often still there, cannot be retrieved by normal means. </p>
		<p>Properly trained technicians often can recover data. The process can be
		  painstaking and delicate, and only a few are qualified to recover data. Those
		  who are qualified usually charge high prices for their service, which customers
		  are willing to pay. </p>
		<p>Fred earns a comfortable living as president of his own small data recovery
		  company, Recoupabyte Confidential, Inc. Starting five years ago from a one-person
		  operation, he now employs a team of six: three technicians for the service
		  side, and three staff members for the business side. The corporate website
		  advertises comprehensive data recovery from most mishaps, free estimates,
		  and complete confidentiality. Their tagline is &#8220;Your reputation is
		  safe with us.&#8221; Fred had often thought about that line, thinking that, &#8220;Your
		  data is safe with us&#8221; might be more accurate.</p>
		<p>Fred assigned Arnie, a new technician, to the case of a new customer, Mr.
		  Bowen. In a rage, Mr. Bowen had hurled his laptop through a window of his
		  house. After calming down, he realized that all his tax records were on the
		  computer and he had no backup. He gathered up the pieces of the laptop and
		  brought them to Recoupabyte. During the interview, with Fred and Arnie both
		  present, Bowen nervously inquired about the confidentiality promise. He wanted
		  to make sure that Recoupabyte would treat all data in the strictest confidence,
		  no matter what it might be. Fred assured him that anything on the computer,
		  unless it involved plans for future criminal activity, would be completely
		  safe with Recoupabyte. &#8220;We are all professionals here!&#8221; he said. </p>
		<p>Since the hard drive had been damaged, Arnie had to extract and examine
		  one file at a time. Many files were lost or hopelessly corrupted. In examining
		  files, Arnie noticed some poor-quality photographs of what looked like a
		  badly injured person. He continued the retrieval process and found a folder
		  called &#8220;diary&#8221; that contained files named by month and year.
		  He examined one of these files and found it to be a first-person account
		  of daily activities. His curiosity getting the better of him, he found the
		  diary file with the same date as one of the photographs. To his amazement,
		  the diary contained a brief, perfunctory account of a murder. </p>
		<p>Shocked by what he had seen, Arnie went home early. In the middle of the
		  night, unable to sleep, he got on the Internet and started searching for
		  information about a local murder committed about that time. He found nothing
		  about a murder, but a month after the date on the file, there had been an
		  unresolved missing person report. </p>
		<p>The following morning, Arnie went in early and read the entire diary. By
		  his own account, Mr. Bowen was an extremely volatile person, who frequently
		  flew into uncontrollable rages. His diary recounted numerous times he had
		  destroyed property or ruined friendships in his rage, only to come to his
		  senses later and indulge in bouts of self loathing and remorse. Remorse quickly
		  passed until the next incident. </p>
		<p>According to the diary, Bowen had struck a drinking buddy during an argument,
		  knocking him out. The sight of him lying unconscious on the floor had only
		  enraged Bowen all the more. He continued hitting and kicking him until his
		  fury was spent. When Bowen came to his senses and checked for a pulse, he
		  realized his friend was dead. The diary went on to describe how he disposed
		  of the body, but did not give a location. </p>
		<p>Arnie called Fred into the lab, showed him the files and poured out the
		  whole story. &#8220;So what do we do?&#8221; he asked. <br>
  Fred replied, &#8220;We recover his data and give it back to him.&#8221; <br>
&#8220; And then what?&#8221;<br>
&#8220; Send him a bill.&#8221; </p>
		<p>Arnie turned red and spluttered in disbelief, until Fred finally explained. &#8220;Look,
		  kid. This company is built on confidentiality. People need to know that we
		  will not turn them in, no matter who they are. Otherwise, if we start picking
		  and choosing what dirt we turn over and what we sweep under the rug, we&#8217;ll
		  lose all trust. We&#8217;re not a jury. We&#8217;re not even consultants
		  or advisors, we&#8217;re just housecleaners. Not noticing anything in the
		  house we&#8217;re cleaning is just good business practice. And what if it&#8217;s
		  not a real diary, but notes for a novel? So, finish your work and stop snooping
		  through Bowen&#8217;s files, O.K.?&#8221; </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p><strong>Case 3</strong><br>
  After the Spotsylvania, Virginia, Sheriff&#8217;s Department noticed that men
  frequented the Moon Spa late at night, the spa was put under investigation.
  Undercover officers, posing as customers, paid for and received sexual services. </p>
		<p>Many law enforcement departments specifically prohibit officers from engaging
		  in sex to aid in conviction. However, in Spotsylvania, as in some other jurisdictions,
		  prostitutes cannot be convicted of a criminal offense without evidence that
		  sexual acts were performed. Receiving money for sex without performing sexual
		  acts is not sufficient for conviction, nor is a verbal promise of sex grounds
		  for prosecution.</p>
		<p>Supporters, such as Spotsylvania County Sheriff Howard Smith, defend the
		  practice as the only way to gain convictions and rid the county of prostitution.
		  Without proof of sexual activity, the charges are misdemeanors. Once sexual
		  activity is initiated, the crime becomes a felony, allowing seizure of assets,
		  which, Smith says, is the only way to discourage prostitution from becoming
		  establishing in the area.</p>
		<p>Opponents argue that this practice poses a serious risk to officers&#8217; health,
		  as well as to their current or future partners. Many sex workers are illegal
		  aliens, coerced into the sex trade through a network of human traffickers:
		  victims too ashamed or fearful of prosecution or deportation to escape or
		  seek help. Further, they contend that the credibility of law enforcement
		  agencies is compromised when officers engage in the criminal activity they
		  are prosecuting, thus breaking the law in order to uphold it. Attorney Irv
		  Maze of Jefferson County, Kentucky (where the practice was supported until
		  recently) said, &quot;We in law enforcement have a higher standard than to
		  act like that. Otherwise, we're no better...&quot;</p>
		<p> Similarly, in many jurisdictions, law enforcement officers buy drugs with
		  public funds as part of their investigations. Some see a difference in buying
		  drugs and buying sex. They argue that buying drugs gets them off the street
		  and prevents their further distribution and use. Others see no difference,
		  and contend that buying drugs increases demand, and therefore, supply. </p>
		<p> <br>
            <strong>Case 4</strong><br>
  Onewang Rebecca Kasienyane, South African National Assembly Chairperson of
  the Portfolio Committee on Labour, announced last year that Parliament would
  soon consider a proposal to limit affirmative action to those born before 2
  February 1990 &#8211; the day bans on the African National Congress (ANC),
  the Pan African Congress (PAC) and other liberation organizations were lifted.
  The announcement by Ms. Kasienyane, an ANC Member of Parliament from North
  West Province, followed public hearings by her Committee on Youth Unemployment.
  In committee meetings, affirmative action and Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)
  policies came under fire from some youth organizations that complained about
  their perceived unfairness.</p>
		<p> The request to ban affirmative action for &#8220;born frees&#8221; (i.e.,
		  South Africans born after 2 February 1990) came from the University of Pretoria&#8217;s
		  Tuks Afrikaanse Studente (TAS), an Afrikaner youth organization. The membership
		  argued that most young white people born after that date knew nothing about
		  the apartheid dispensation and, as such, should not be penalized when trying
		  to find work. At the public hearing, Cornelius Jansen van Rensburg of TAS
		  went further. He presented statistics showing that the number of matriculating
		  black students had grown by 100 percent under affirmative action, while the
		  number of white students had decreased by 20 percent. Jansen van Rensburg
		  asserted that, whether the difference can be ascribed to large-scale emigration
		  or the government quota system for specialized courses, white students were
		  being disadvantaged twice: in university admissions, and in the job market. &#8220;We
		  had nothing to do with the previous regime, and now we are the ones bearing
		  the brunt of a policy that is in fact not serving the academic aim, but is
		  used to oppress us,&#8221; said Jansen van Rensburg.</p>
		<p> The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) later came out
		  most strongly against the proposal of dispensation for born frees. &#8220;The
		  country should deal with the enormous inequalities created under apartheid
		  for the past three centuries, rather than worrying about who gets the meat
		  and how the affirmative action is poison for others,&#8221; said the union. &#8220;A
		  black child born in 2006 in a squatter camp still does not enjoy the same
		  privileges and opportunities as white children.&#8221;</p>
		<p> Reacting to The Federation of Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA), which welcomed
		  the proposal, NUMSA stated, &#8220;We will vigorously frustrate attempts
		  by the Federation and opposition parties in Parliament to limit affirmative
		  action. Affirmative action was put on the agenda for social and economic
		  change and it was all about scrapping and burying apartheid.&#8221;</p>
		<p> FUDUSA spokesperson Kim Mapley said the federation had always believed
		  that affirmative action should be implemented for a defined period only and
		  that those who grew up with equal opportunities should be excluded from the
		  process. </p>
		<p> <br>
            <strong>Case 5</strong><br>
  Egged on by screaming fans, Cage Fighting is a bloody contest with one cage,
  two men, three rounds, and four rules (no eye gouging, no fishhooks to the
  mouth, no fingers in orifices, no groin attacks). The cage, about the size
  of a king-size bed, is made of chain link with a padded floor. </p>
		<p> Although some states now ban boxing because of its violence, most allow
		  Cage Fighting, which is less regulated and more brutal. In response to municipalities&#8217; bans
		  on cage fighting, organizers have instituted changes such as weight classes
		  and shorter matches, and outlawed some practices such as stomping and biting.
		  Yet, while some organizations travel a circuit with trained fighters, others
		  solicit inebriated participants from the audience and nearby bars.</p>
		<p> To some, a Cage Fight is a test between modern-day gladiators demonstrating
		  their athletic prowess. To others, it is cockfighting with humans that sometimes
		  leaves participant crippled. Supporters of Cage Fighting argue that it is
		  a legitimate sport, and while it does pose a danger to participants, so do
		  many other contact sports that are not restricted. Competitors want to fight,
		  and fans (sometimes thousands at a time) want to watch them. Fights are refereed,
		  and a fighter can stop the action anytime by tapping on the cage or the opponent&#8217;s
		  thigh, or telling the referee. Opponents agree that while other contact sports
		  pose the threat of harm to participants, the goal of Cage Fighting is to
		  annihilate the opponent. A contestant may become too debilitated to signal
		  the fight to stop. In addition to the violence of the fights and the danger
		  to participants, opponents raise concerns that the atmosphere surrounding
		  the matches encourages irresponsible alcohol consumption and fan violence.
		  Often matches are held in portable cages in parking lots next to a bar. Others
		  suggest a middle ground, calling for regulation and oversight, codified procedural
		  rules, standardized safety rules, and trained referees. Still others who
		  personally disapprove of Cage Fighting believe fighters have a right to get
		  pummeled if they so choose. They fear even more brutal fights if Cage Fighting
		  is forced underground.</p>
		<p> Dr. Rosi Sexton, a mathematician at Manchester University, is a cage fighter.
		  She says Cage Fighting, like mathematics is a challenge. She loves the mental
		  challenge of mathematics, and the combined physical and mental challenge
		  of Cage Fighting.</p>
		<p> Despite an increasing number of cities banning Cage Fighting, its popularity
		  continues to grow. </p>
		<p> <br>
            <strong>Case 6</strong><br>
  Several cell phone companies now offer a service that allows parents to track
  their children&#8217;s whereabouts using their cell phones. Sprint, for example,
  has its Family Locator Service. Whoever pays for the phone is provided the
  ability to track it with GPS. (Global Positioning System, a satellite based
  navigation technology) In Finland permission is needed for tracking anyone
  over fifteen. The United States has no such law.<br>
      <br>
  Parents who favor tracking are looking for security in light of child abductions,
  terrorist warnings, and online predators. C.T. O'Donnell, president of KidsPeace,
  tell his two teens, &quot;It's my job as a parent to protect you.&#8221; Robert
  Butterworth, a Los Angeles therapist, points out, &#8220;When I was growing
  up, neighbors were always watching us, and we didn't want to mess up because
  somebody might tell [our parents]. That sense of community no longer exists
  because no one wants to get involved, so parents are forced to use technology.&quot; In
  agreement with child therapists, O'Donnell agrees that kids should be told
  they are being tracked and why. </p>
		<p> Critics warn that tracking children, with or without their permission,
		  can erode trust and create anxiety about a &#8220;dangerous world.&#8221; They
		  worry that kids will become resentful and look for ways to avoid tracking.
		  Some suggest that unless a child has violated trust, such devices do more
		  harm than good. </p>
		<p> <br>
            <strong>Case 7</strong><br>
  Imaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have proven
  to be powerful diagnostic tools in clinical medicine, allowing physicians to
  identify the presence and course of many diseases and conditions that may otherwise
  go undetected or be misdiagnosed. This same technology also has provided biomedical
  researchers with a detailed map of a wide range of physiological processes,
  especially those related to the human brain. A recent innovation, functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), permits neuroscientists to track the flow
  of blood through the brain, allowing them to correlate various mental states
  and processes with neuronal activity in certain areas of the brain. Researchers
  have found that some parts of the brain are specifically associated with language
  use and development, while others correlate more closely with particular cognitive
  and emotional states. Neuronal patterns associated with complicated processes,
  such as decision-making and memory retrieval, and with personality traits,
  such as empathy and extraversion appear to be identifiable through fMRI. </p>
		<p> While the commercial use of brain scans to test for personality traits
		  is only hypothetical at this time, another kind of practical application
		  of the fMRI is already available to consumers. Last year, San Diego-based
		  No Lie MRI, opened its doors for business. No Lie MRI offers lie-detection
		  services using the fMRI, and has since expanded its operations to the Philadelphia
		  area. Likewise, Cephos Corp. of Pepperell, MA offers the same services at
		  the Medical University of South Carolina. Both boast an accuracy rate of
		  90-93 per cent, slightly higher than that boasted by polygraph makers of
		  (85-90 per cent). Polygraphs sense, among other things, perspiration, heart
		  rate, and respiratory activity. Subtle increases in heart rate or perspiration
		  are associated with the nervousness people typically experience when lying.
		  These signs can be suppressed, however, so fMRIs may enjoy an advantage.
		  According to Dr. Ferdinand B. Mohammed, director of Temple University&#8217;s
		  Functional Brain Imaging Center, &#8220;Since brain activation is arguably
		  less susceptible to being controlled by an individual, our research will
		  hopefully eliminate the shortcomings of the conventional polygraph test and
		  produce a new method of objective lie detection that can be used reliably
		  in the court room and other settings.&#8221; However, using fMRIs to detect
		  deception is both complicated and cumbersome. A subject lies down with his
		  head inside an MRI machine. Then &#8220;yes or no&#8221; questions are presented
		  on a small screen directly in front of the subject&#8217;s face, and subjects
		  respond by pushing buttons. By tracking neuronal activity associated with
		  lying, an examiner can identify the veracity of statements with a high rate
		  of accuracy.</p>
		<p> The fMRI has found practical applications unrelated to medicine, lie-detection,
		  or pure research. One proposed use relates to the possibility of detecting
		  personality traits and mental capacities. Employers, insurers, and schools
		  are interested in the character tendencies and capacities of applicants.
		  Applicants for sales positions might be screened for extroversion or persistence.
		  Others might be screened for the capacity to multi-task. Health insurers
		  might screen for personality traits associated with high-risk behaviors.
		  Credit card, mortgage, and other financial institutions might screen applicants
		  against specific character traits.</p>
		<p> Not everyone shares the enthusiasm surrounding the use of fMRIs for lie-detection
		  and characterization of personality traits. Civil libertarians worry that
		  it is one more threat to individual privacy. Says Barry Steinhardt, director
		  of the American Civil Liberties Union&#8217;s Technology and Liberty Project, &#8220;They
		  are going to be deployed to read people&#8217;s thoughts&#8230;(And) little,
		  if any, attention has been paid to potential misuses and the devastating
		  impact it would have on our civil liberties.&#8221; Information that is usually
		  legally off-limits could be gathered through an fMRI. There may be temptation
		  for employers and schools to use this technology to screen applicants for
		  desirable traits and to weed out candidates whose tests suggest undesirable
		  characteristics.
        <p>Another concern relates to the storage of personal information gathered
          through the use of fMRIs. How will confidentiality be maintained? Some
          worry that brain scans have not proven themselves in the real world.
          That is, they may work reliably with test subjects when little is at
          stake, but may provide inaccurate results when there are serious real-life
          consequences. Stronger critics reject the claims of an exceptionally
          high accuracy rate for fMRI as no better than similar claims for the
          polygraph, a device denounced by one critic as &#8220;a ruse, carefully
          constructed as a tool of intimidation, and used as an excuse to conduct
          an illegal inquisition under psychologically and physically unpleasant
          circumstances.&#8221; <br>
    <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/2001-07/polygraph.html">http://www.csicop.org/si/2001-07/polygraph.html</a></p>
        &#8221;
        Nonetheless, entrepreneurs of fMRI technology remain unconvinced that
        any serious irresolvable ethical challenges loom on the horizon. &#8220;We
        understand that there are further ethics conversations needed when science
        pushes the envelope,&#8221; says
Steven Laken of Cephos Corp, &#8220;but we don&#8217;t see these tests being
set up in dressing rooms and shopping malls. That&#8217;s not going to happen.&#8221;

    <strong>Case 8</strong><br>
  A growing number of universities have recently started offering courses in
  the study of pornography. A few such courses are &#8220;Cyberporn and Society,&#8221; at
  the State University of New York at Buffalo; &#8220;Cinema and the Sex Act,&#8221; at
  the University of California, Berkeley; &#8220;Pornography in Popular Culture,&#8221; at
  the University of Iowa; and &#8220;Sex and the Law,&#8221; at UCLA.</p>
<p>Academic discussion of pornography has been around for a long time, usually
  in the context of first-amendment issues, gender and society, or feminist studies.
  But some professors say that merely studying pornography without watching it
  is ineffective, and they advocate in-class screening or display of pornographic
  material. Time Magazine quotes a Northwestern University professor of communication
  studies as saying, &#8220;University students are often too cool, too hip to
  understand why other people get perturbed [at pornography]. Showing a film
  like this allows them to react and then take a step back and analyze their
  reaction with the critical reflective tools you give them.&#8221; The film
  she was referring to was &#8220;Sal&ograve;, or 120 days of Sodom,&#8221; which,
  she says, disgusted and horrified students who had previously expressed staunchly
  liberal views about freedom of expression.</p>
<p> Promoting pornography is not the goal expressed by teachers of these courses.
  Those who teach pornography typically do so to warn of its psychological dangers,
  expose its corrosive impact on culture, and alert the audience to the harm
  it does to the understanding of what it is to be human. For instance, according
  to Anna Reading, a Reader in Arts and Media at London (UK) South Bank University,
  Andrea Dworkin, an outspoken opponent of pornography, toured England and America
  promoting her book, &#8220;Pornography: Men Possessing Women&#8221; (1989).
  On this tour she gave lectures in which she read passages that depicted women
  as sexual slaves. According to Reading, &#8220;Her lectures shocked, disgusted,
  and dismayed student audiences, generating a new wave of women and some men
  to become involved in questioning the ideology of pornography.&#8221;</p>
<p> However, many people think the college classroom is not an appropriate venue
  for such materials. Wendy Wright, director of Communications for Concerned
  Women for America, asserts that studying it in the classroom &#8220;lends legitimacy
  to pornography.&#8221; She says, &#8220;One thing that we can do is let it
  be known that this is happening, and to let parents know that the education
  they are helping to fund is being spent not on education, but rather promoting
  pornography.&#8221;</p>
<p> Even some professors who teach courses on pornography have reservations.
  According to Paul Abramsom, a professor of psychology at UCLA, pornography
  is &#8220;so pervasive in our culture, most students have already seen it,&#8221; so,
  actually showing it in class seems unnecessary.</p>
<p> <br>
    <strong>Case 9</strong><br>
  Early in the spring of 2006, self-professed Earth Liberation Front activist
  Eric Taylor McDavid was arrested and charged with conspiracy to blow up the
  Nimbus Dam and the nearby fish hatchery in Rancho Cordova, California, as well
  as a U.S. Forest Service genetics lab in Placerville, California. While awaiting
  trial, McDavid was held in the Sacramento County prison. </p>
<p> For the three years prior to his arrest, McDavid maintained a vegan diet.
  Early in March, McDavid embarked on a hunger strike and his attorney filed
  a federal lawsuit charging that the prison&#8217;s refusal to provide McDavid
  with vegan meals constituted a violation of his civil rights. According to
  the lawsuit, &quot;His (McDavid&#8217;s) vegan diet is based upon his strongly,
  sincerely and firmly held beliefs, which are the same as a religious belief.&quot;</p>
<p> According to the Sacramento County Sheriff&#8217;s department, a vegan diet
  is considered to be a lifestyle choice rather than a matter of religious belief
  or conscience. Even if these were on a par, the department makes dietary accommodations
  only for medical reasons, not for religious reasons, and makes additional food
  items available in the prison commissary for inmates to purchase to supplement
  their meals. Some of the trouble lies in determining what constitutes a religious
  belief for legal purposes. A Buddhist inmate seeking the provision of soy milk
  to supplement his meatless diet on the grounds that vegetarian meals are necessary
  to Buddhist religious practice won his case despite the fact that his beliefs
  were not shared nor considered essential by others in the Buddhist religion. </p>
<p> Even if it could be determined what constitutes a religious belief under
  federal law, there is disagreement over whether the prison system has responsibility
  for providing special meals at all. While denying three New York inmates their
  appeal for vegan meals on the grounds that vegan meals are central to their
  orthodox Jewish beliefs, the presiding judge said she did not question the
  sincerity of the inmates&#8217; religious beliefs, but agreed with the city&#8217;s
  claim that a blanket policy of not providing vegan or vegetarian meals to any
  inmates was important to an efficient, cost-effective food program. The judge
  also noted that the inmates were managing on their current food availability,
  saying, &#8220;I am not saying it&#8217;s been pleasant. I&#8217;m not saying
  it&#8217;s been easy. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s been without effect,
  but they have tolerated it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, Sacramento sheriff's officials said McDavid is free to discard
  what he finds inedible, and still get a diet that meets nutritional standards.
  Lt. Scott Jones said a dietitian has met with McDavid and determined that even
  if McDavid discards animal products from his daily meals, his diet meets his
  nutritional needs.</p>
<p>Mark Reichel, McDavid&#8217;s attorney said, &quot;This really is beneath
  the dignity of a society that calls itself civilized.&quot;</p>
<p>After over 100 days of incarceration Eric McDavid finally received his first
  vegan meal, which consisted of two peanut butter sandwiches, cooked vegetables,
  plain rice, fruit, carrot sticks, and salad.</p>

    <strong>Case 10</strong><br>
  Sharon Duchesneau and Candace McCullough are both deaf, and are the parents
  of a deaf child, Jehanne. To increase the chances of having a second deaf child,
  they selected a sperm donor with a family history of several generations of
  deafness Their son, Gauvin, was born with a complete hearing loss in one ear
  and a serious hearing loss in the other. Although a hearing aid would allow
  Gauvin some level of hearing in the one ear, his parents refuse any treatment
  that allows even residual hearing, saying they will allow him to choose hearing
  or deafness when he is older.<br>
          <br>
          The use of reproductive technologies to select for desired traits has
          long raised ethical concerns about using technologies to give children
          a disproportionate advantage. The decisions of Gauvin&#8217;s parents
          to ensure he would be born deaf, and remain deaf, have raised the issue
          of defining &#8220;handicap&#8221; and &#8220;enhancement&#8221;. While
          many believe deafness to be a disability &#8211; it is listed as such
          in the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, and many sperm
          banks will not accept sperm from donors who have congenital deafness
          - others, such as Gauvin&#8217;s parents, believe deafness to be a
          benefit. <br>
		    Critics of genetic selection for deafness or failure to remediate
		    hearing loss consider deafness to be a disability that limits a child&#8217;s
		    potential. They believe deafness limits pleasure and safety, creates difficulty
		    in acquiring language, impedes communication, and may cause a child to
		    be ostracized. Children's rights advocates strongly oppose selecting for
		    deafness, as inability to hear limits language development and career options,
		    and eliminates the ability to hear the sounds of music, nature, or human
		    speech. Children who grow up with hearing playmates often find these friendships
		    diminish as talking in adolescence becomes as important as the physical
		    play of childhood. Others fear that selecting deafness for a child may
		    lead to more restrictive use of reproductive technologies for parents at
		    risk of conceiving a child with genetic maladies such as Cystic Fibrosis
		    or Tay Sachs. If parents are allowed to select for deafness, some ask if
		    parents may also select for blindness.</p>
<p>Proponents argue that the deaf community experiences a degree of emotional
  intimacy not achieved in the hearing world, and these bonds of community outweigh
  the benefits of hearing. Deaf people often have a heightened sense of smell,
  touch and vision. In an interview in the Washington Post, Candace McCullough
  called deafness a cultural identity, not a handicap. Supporters say that McCullough
  and Duchesneau did not create a handicapped child: they allowed a handicapped
  child to be born. Jim Roots, of the Canadian Association for the Deaf, sees
  no difference in deaf parents who wish to have a deaf child like themselves,
  and hearing parents who fit a child with hearing aids, use cochlear implants,
  or resort to surgery to allow their children to hear. Clients of sperm banks
  are able to choose characteristics they want in a donor, such as height, hair
  color, race, and other traits, and are able to choose a donor without evidence
  of disease or disability who matches themselves as closely as possible. Why
  should deaf parents not be allowed to select traits that reflect themselves
  in their children?</p>

    <strong>Case 11</strong><br>
  The Pentagon has contracted with BeNow, a commercial direct marketing firm,
  to collect and analyze wide-ranging data on 30 million US youth aged16-25.
  According to the Washington Post, information includes names and addresses,
  gender, Social Security numbers, email addresses, grade point averages, ethnicity,
  subjects of study, and interest in college. Added to that will be information
  BeNow compiles from such sources as commercial databases, state drivers&#8217; license
  records, and other government databases - but usually not directly from the
  individuals listed. The Pentagon has spent $500,000 each year since 2002 on
  the database, in addition to millions on polling and market research. <br>
      <br>
  The Pentagon believes this database will provide an efficient central recruiting
  file for all branches of the service and will help recruiters target their
  approaches to individuals. David Chu, top advisor to former Secretary of Defense
  Donald Rumsfeld, said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t want conscription, you have
  to give the Department of Defense an avenue to contact people.&#8221; High
  schools, as required by a little-known provision of the 2002 No Child Left
  Behind legislation, must supply recruiters with their students&#8217; contact
  information, or risk losing federal funding. Ironically, the No Child Left
  Behind provision allows parents to opt their children out of providing information
  to recruiters. But exercising that option automatically puts the individuals&#8217; information
  into a &#8220;suppression&#8221; file in the Pentagon&#8217;s database, assuring
  that they are still in the list.</p>
<p> Critics claim development of the database is in direct violation of the 1974
  Privacy Act that specifies that when the government collects data on individuals,
  the individual must supply that data or be notified that it is being compiled.
  The Pentagon database is being compiled by a private sector company from secondary
  sources and, in fact, was several years along in development before its existence
  was revealed. The Washington Post reports &#8220;privacy advocates said the
  plan appeared to be an effort to circumvent laws that restrict the government&#8217;s
  right to collect or hold citizen information by turning to private firms to
  do the work.&#8221; Barry Steinhardt, speaking for the American Civil Liberties
  Union (ACLU), agrees: &#8220;The government should not be able to evade the
  law and core American values by outsourcing the work to the private sector.&#8221; He
  calls the effort, &#8220;&#8230;especially disturbing when it&#8217;s targeted
  at kids as young as 16.&#8221; </p>
<p> The ACLU is also concerned that the Pentagon has reserved the right to disclose
  database information to any of fourteen entities in the &#8220;blanket routine
  uses&#8221; provision. These include tax authorities, law enforcement, and
  Congress, among others. Other critics fear for the security of such extensive
  and personal data held by either government or private sources. The threat
  of identity theft if the files are compromised seems quite high. Barbara Boxer,
  US Senator from California, said that the program &#8220;puts millions of teenagers
  unnecessarily at risk.&#8221;</p>
<p> Felicity Crush, speaking for the organization Leave My Child Alone, fears
  the level of profiling and targeting the database allows in recruiting efforts.
  She reports that students with low grades were told, &#8220;This is your one
  shot out of here,&#8221; while better students would hear, &#8220;You are a
  smart person, you belong in the military.&#8221; Other critics fear coercion,
  and targeting youth from poorer economic backgrounds or particular ethnic groups.</p>
<p>A national coalition of advocacy groups petitioned the Pentagon to abandon
  the database and related targeted marketing efforts. They contend that the
  database &#8220;represents an unprecedented foray of the government into direct
  marketing techniques previously only performed by the private sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other side of the issue, however, few would disagree that, despite
  the increasing sophistication of recent weapons technology, the legitimate
  defense interests of the United States require large numbers of trained, combat-ready
  personnel, and, for this reason, without a military draft, the armed forces
  must be able to utilize highly effective recruitment methods.</p>
<p> <br>
    <strong>Case 12</strong><br>
  After Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005, resulting in the breach
  of the complex levee system, Sacramento residents began to worry that the same
  fate might await them. Sacramento, situated at the confluence of the Sacramento
  and American Rivers, is nationally rated as the city at greatest risk of major
  flooding. </p>
<p> Farmers and private developers built many of the levees in northern California.
  In agricultural areas, levees were designed to protect fields, as well as permit
  periodic flooding. In several areas, these levees are little more than soil
  and peat mounds pushed against the riverbank and raised over the years by the
  addition of more material. Despite this complex history of private levee construction,
  a 1986 court ruling affirmed the state&#8217;s liability for flood damages
  caused by levee failures. </p>
<p>At several locations in and around the metropolitan area, land elevation is
  lower than the elevation of nearby rivers. All areas of the metropolitan region
  are vulnerable to catastrophic flooding, in some areas to an estimated water
  depth of 20 feet. The Natomas neighborhood is particularly vulnerable as it
  was built in a natural flood basin in what was recently agricultural land.
  Including the tributaries flowing into the Sacramento River, Natomas is surrounded
  on three sides by major waterways.</p>
<p>In 1998, Sacramento lifted an eight-year building moratorium in the Natomas
  area, in response to the Army Core of Engineers&#8217; certification of the
  levees and a real estate market demanding ever-greater expansion into ever-riskier
  locations. Since then, the area has grown by 47,000 new residents. However,
  in July 2006, the ACE reversed its previous certification. According to Thomas
  E. Trainer, chief of the engineering division, &#8220;We can no longer support
  our original position regarding certification of the levees system,&#8221; at
  the FEMA minimum of 100 year flood protection. </p>
<p>The city planned to build another 10,000 homes in the basin. In November 2006,
  the California Department of Water Resources, which is legally liable for maintaining
  the flood control system, requested that the city consider reinstating the
  building moratorium until the levees can be repaired. </p>
<p> According to Lester Snow, Director of DWR, &#8220;the area is at high risk
  and will continue to be at high risk for several years&#8230; It is imperative
  that additional measures be taken to reduce the threat to public safety and
  property.&#8221; This risk is significant. Governor Schwarzenegger recently
  said, &#8220;We are literally one storm or one big earthquake away from a major
  disaster.&#8221; Current estimates indicate it would take more than $68 billion
  and 4 years to conclude the necessary repairs.</p>
<p>According to Graham Brownstein, director of the Environmental Council of Sacramento, &#8220;It
  just does not make any sense from a fiscal, environmental, or moral perspective
  to continue to plan and approve more housing in deep flood basins until we
  have real protection.&#8221; </p>
<p>In response to the state agency&#8217;s request, Sacramento city mayor Heather
  Fargo said, &#8220;We&#8217;re not in denial over this&#8230; we&#8217;re just
  trying to make sure that we make a wise decision.&#8221;</p>
<p> <br>
    <strong>Case 13</strong><br>
  In the not so distant past, travelers relied mainly on guidebooks and/or seasoned
  travel agents to help them select the most appropriate accommodations when
  staying in unfamiliar locales. This was rarely problematic because guidebooks
  are written by professional writers and edited for accuracy, and agents usually
  provide candid recommendations even when commissions paid to them by hotels
  vary considerably. (The long-term financial success of travel agencies depends
  more on cultivating long-term relationships with clients than focusing on strategies
  that maximize commissions.)</p>
<p> Because of the expanding reach of the Internet, however, today&#8217;s travelers
  are likely to eschew guidebooks, viewing them as limited and dated. Even the
  less tech-savvy find it easier than ever to locate a guest review of any particular
  hotel online&#8211;sometimes within only a few days of the reviewer&#8217;s
  checkout date. The Internet puts consumers in control of their travel plans,
  and travelers increasingly turn to online travel websites as an alternative
  to travel agencies, whether virtual or brick and mortar. Online, consumers
  are able to gather all the facts they need and compare prices and options to
  find the best deal. This can be done at travelers&#8217; convenience, 24 hours
  a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p> As websites that publish guest hotel reviews become more influential, some
  hotels go to great lengths to ensure that their properties are rated highly.
  Some hoteliers claim that investing in their properties and focusing greater
  attention on customer service &#8211; the traditional course for improving
  the profile of their establishments &#8211; is an inefficient, if not entirely
  ineffective, counterweight to out-of-context rants posted by disgruntled guests.
  Analysts say that hotels now rely on a number of strategies to raise their
  online ratings, from encouraging guests to write flattering reviews, to offering
  future discounts for positive comments online, and sometimes even submitting
  bogus recommendations to websites. While most hotel operators publicly claim
  they do not to attempt to influence reviews, publishers of online travel websites
  profess to be inundated by fraudulent posts, which force them to develop numerous
  measures to protect travelers. Stanley Roberts, CEO of the dining and review
  site We8there.com, evaluates every review submitted to his site, relying on &#8220;instinct
  and experience&#8221; to ferret out reviews of doubtful authenticity. Even
  so, Mr. Roberts concedes that he is never sure if he catches all the fakes
  or retains every legitimate post. Indeed, sites such as We8there have come
  under heavy criticism by hotel executives who claim that subjective filtering
  is now preventing the posting of positive guest comments.</p>
<p> In the absence of an accurate means to gauge the influence of self-selected
  reviewer comments, the consequences of this dispute remain unknown. Yet, for
  the parties involved, the stakes are high. Whatever the case, resolution seems
  far away when even the most temperate encouragement by hoteliers to encourage
  posting feedback pushes website publishers to summarily delete every review
  of the offenders&#8217; property.</p>
<p><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Case 14</strong><br>
  The term &quot;urban university&quot; has many meanings, and varies depending
  on context. In the academy, broadly, urban universities are institutions of
  higher education located in socially and economically diverse communities of
  more than one-quarter-million. An important mission of these schools is to
  serve their communities by raising the level of educational attainment within
  them, especially for traditionally underserved populations. To do this, most
  urban universities include graduate and professional schools, some of which
  grant a terminal degree and adopt lower admission standards to increase access
  and opportunity.</p>
<p> At a large urban Midwestern university, the faculty of the Master of Urban
  Planning Program (MUP) long ago adopted a 2.50 grade point average (GPA) as
  a minimum admission standard. The Department of Urban Planning frequently admits
  students with lower GPAs who otherwise demonstrate potential for success in
  the graduate program, on the condition that they achieve at least a &quot;B&quot; average
  in their prescribed classes during the first semester of the program. By rule,
  failure to meet this conditional standard precludes students from further pursuing
  a MUP degree at the institution.</p>
<p> In recent years, the department chair refused to dismiss students who did
  not achieve the grade point upon which their continuation in the MUP program
  hinged. The chair also routinely made exceptions for students who were admitted
  without conditions to continue their studies indefinitely when their academic
  record fell below the standards set by the graduate school. When challenged
  by colleagues and university administrators, the chair defended the actions
  as necessary to advance the institution's urban mission by providing disadvantaged
  students with every chance to realize their academic goals. &quot;This is especially
  important,&quot; the chair argued, &quot;since the state is experiencing its
  most dramatic economic downturn in more than 50 years.&quot;</p>
<p> Quietly, other faculty in the department raised concerns about the chair's
  practice of retaining unqualified students. They contended that the students
  in question are unlikely ever to graduate from the program, even with the remedial
  help provided by professors. Students commonly repeat classes without appreciably
  improving their grade. Furthermore, a significant number of students who are
  failing in the program cannot be considered disadvantaged.</p>
<p> &quot;It is particularly troubling,&quot; offered a junior faculty member, &quot;to
  continue to accept tuition from students who have little chance to succeed
  in the program. The Department is not providing opportunity: it is acting opportunistically.
  This is especially disturbing because many of the under-performing MUP students
  are considerably older and the opportunity cost for them to remain in the program
  is likely very steep. &quot;</p>
<p> As the State continues to cut direct aid for higher education, the university
  finds itself hemorrhaging financially. Increases in tuition are only likely
  to help the university reduce its budget deficit as long as enrollment remains
  steady or increases. In response to continuing cuts, the administration has
  gradually begun to adjust its system of incentives to reward matriculation
  and retention numbers rather than graduation rates. As long as enrollment in
  the MUP program continues to grow steadily, the administration seems willing
  to accept the chair&#8217;s rationale concerning retention of under-performing
  students. Following such a path has allowed the administration to spare the
  MUP program from funding cuts and improve the university's bottom line. &#8220;After
  all&#8221;, the Provost commented, &quot;there would be no urban mission without
  a financially healthy University to promote it.&quot;</p>
<p> <br>
    <strong>Case 15</strong><br>
  For nearly 40 years, the young residents of Don Jean Bay have performed as
  members of a water-ski team. The Lauderdale Aqua Skiers practice their jumps,
  spins, pyramids, and other maneuvers 4 &#8211;7pm Wednesdays and Fridays, with
  3pm practice before the 6pm Saturday show. During the show, and at some practices,
  music blares over the lake. </p>
<p> Until 1999, the team launched from land owned by a private individual. When
  the land was sold, the team moved its practice site to nearby Elkhorn Lake,
  but continued to use Don Jean Bay for practices and performances on a more
  limited basis. The following year, the Lauderdale Lakes Lake Management District
  Board purchased the old launch site, and the team continued to split its practices
  and performances between the two lakes. In 2003, Elkhorn Lake Council decided
  to forbid powerboats on the lake, and the team began to use Don Jean Bay exclusively
  once again. </p>
<p> Long-time residents value the team as a healthy tradition involving generations
  of family members. The approximately 80 skiers represent about 55 families,
  some of whom are fourth generation ski-team members. Ski team is not just a
  summer sport, but a year-round activity, with the winter months devoted to
  making costumes and raising money, and the summer to practice and performance.
  Said Louise Meike, whose grandchildren are part of the fourth generation of
  Meike ski-team members &quot;This is family.&quot;</p>
<p> To some homeowners the Lauderdale Aqua Skiers are an impediment to quiet
  weekends they envisioned when they purchased their lake homes. About 20 families,
  mostly newcomers, signed a petition spelling out their concerns about safety,
  noise, and erosion. They claim the team limits others&#8217; access to the
  lake, and that they venture into the no-wake zone &#8211; a claim the skiers
  dispute. The petition states that the jump is unsafe and that the powerful
  boats churn up the lake bottom, causing shoreline erosion. Petitioners object
  to the noise of practice sessions.</p>
<p> William Kochlefl, a Winnetka lawyer, and his wife Rhonda bought Don Jean
  Bay lake property in 1998. When the team resumed heavier use of the lake in
  2004, the Kochlefls were upset with the increased noise and use. Kochlefl accused
  the team of violating environmental laws by launching from a site designated
  as a conservation area, and demanded the team&#8217;s permit be withdrawn.
  The Lake Management District, who owns the land, told Mr. Kochlefl that the
  team&#8217;s use of the land was appropriate within the intent of zoning laws.
  The LaGrange Town Board also disregarded Mr. Kochlefl&#8217;s concerns, telling
  him that team supporters outnumbered opponents. Mrs. Kochlefl responded, &quot;I
  want to know why the ski team is above the law.&quot; Walworth County, however,
  agrees with Mr. Kochlefl that the team&#8217;s use of the land violates zoning
  ordinances, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is investigating
  to see if the team needs additional permits, is operating legally, or must
  find a new launch site.</p>
<p> Scott Mason, chairman of the Lauderdale Lakes Lake Management District board,
  voiced the opinion of long-term residents who believe newcomers are trying
  to change a way of life and a community value that has existed for decades. &quot;The
  ski team has been there 30 years and these folks are relatively new.&quot; But
  Mrs. Kochlefl disagrees, believing all property owners should have the same
  rights. Meanwhile, team supporters are lobbying government officials and the
  legislature, and the Lakes Lake Management District Board is considering rezoning
  to allow the team to stay on Don Jean Bay.</p>
