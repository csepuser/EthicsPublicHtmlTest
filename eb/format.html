      <h2>Ethics Bowl Overview: </h2> 
      <br>
      <h3><a href="#rules">Rules</a>, <a href="#format">Format</a>, &amp; <a href="#significance">Significance</a></h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong><a name="rules"></a>I. How Ethics Bowl is Played:</strong></p>
      <p>In Ethics Bowl a moderator asks two teams of three to five undergraduate
        students questions that pose ethical problems on topics ranging widely
        over areas such as the classroom (e.g. cheating or plagiarism), personal
        relationships (e.g. dating or friendship), professional ethics (e.g.
        engineering, architecture, business, the military, law, medicine, etc.)
        or social and political ethics (e.g. free speech, gun control, health
        care, etc.) In an Ethics Bowl competition two teams are asked different
        questions. Each team answers its question according to the following
        format. After the moderator poses a question to a team the team gets
        one minute to confer, after which it must state its answer. (The team
        does not respond completely cold, however, because prior to the Ethics
        Bowl each competing team receives a set of cases that present ethical
        issues upon which the questions a team must answer at the Ethics Bowl
      are based.)</p>
      <p>After the team states its answer to the question posed by the moderator
        the judges then have an opportunity to ask the team brief follow-up questions
        to elicit a teams' viewpoint on ethically important aspects of the question,
        or to seek clarification of a team's response. After the judges have
        asked their questions, the opposing team then has one minute to present
        a response to the first team's answer. The first team then has an opportunity
        to respond to the opposing team's comments.</p>
      <p>The judges have been instructed prior to the Ethics Bowl concerning
        the criteria they are to apply in evaluating the teams' answers, which
        are the following:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Clarity and Intelligibility: </strong>Has the team stated and
        defended its position in a way that is logically consistent and which
        allows the Judges to
          understand clearly the team's line of reasoning?</p>
      <p><strong>Focus on Ethically Relevant Factors:</strong> Has the team identified and discussed
        the factors the Judges consider ethically relevant in connection with
        the case?</p>
      <p><strong>Avoidance of Ethical Irrelevance:</strong> Has the team stayed on track by avoiding
        preoccupation with issues that the Judges do not regard as ethically
        relevant, or as only having minor ethical relevance, in connection with
        a case?</p>
      <p><strong>Deliberative Thoughtfulness:</strong> Does the Team's presentation of its position
        on a question indicate both awareness and thoughtful consideration of
        different viewpoints, including especially those that could loom large
        in the reasoning of individuals who might disagree with the team's position? </p>
      <p><strong><a name="format"></a>II. Format :</strong></p>
      <p> The IEB is a tiered competition in which the top scoring thirty-two 
        teams in ten regional ethics bowls compete against one another at a national 
        ethics bowl. At the national ethics bowl participating teams will compete 
        in three matches during the morning on the day of the event. In the evening 
        the top scoring eight teams will compete in an eight team elimination 
        consisting of four quarter-final matches, two semi-final matches, and 
        a final match.</p>
      <p>In both the regional ethics bowls and the national ethics bowl, four
        to six weeks prior to the day of the event, each entered team, as well
        as every judge and moderator, will receive a set of ethics bowl cases.
        The questions asked of teams are to be taken from this set. As in previous
        ethics bowls, the moderators and judges will be drawn from distinguished
        individuals in diverse fields, such as law, medicine, business, government
        service, engineering, science, academia, and other fields as well.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> <br>
        <strong><a name="significance"></a>III. The Educational Value and Significance 
        of Ethics Bowl:</strong></p>
      <p> Starting in 1993 as a small intramural event at the Illinois Institute 
        of Technology (IIT), organized by IIT's Center for the Study of Ethics 
        in the Professions (CSEP), the IEB has grown to become a national competition 
        in which so many schools wished to take part that it became necessary 
        to reorganize and expand it into its current format, involving ten regional 
        ethics bowls throughout the United States, and a national ethics bowl 
        in which the top scoring teams in the regional ethics bowls compete with 
        one another. Here are some of the reasons why we believe that the IEB 
        has appealed so strongly to educators in the area of practical and professional 
        ethics.</p>
      <p>Participating in the IEB develops students' intellectual abilities and
        capacities, deepens their ethical understanding, and reinforces their
        sense of ethical commitment. With regard to the development of intellectual
        abilities and capacities, the most salient ethical issues for college
        and university students are complicated and ambiguous. Contrary to the
        implied message of a best selling book published several years ago, everything
        one needs to know about ethical issues on topics such as cheating, plagiarism,
        personal relationships, gender inequality, campus political controversies,
        and business or professional ethics in a future career can't be learned
        in kindergarten. Dealing with such issues places heavy demands upon students'
        abilities to discern, analyze, and evaluate, as well as upon their capacity
        to maintain a well organized mental focus under conditions of intellectual
        (and emotional) uncertainty. IEB participation brings all these abilities
        and capacities directly into play.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, students deepen their ethical understanding of complex,
        ambiguous, and highly viewpoint dependent questions through participating
        in the IEB. Ethical understanding in connection with such issues consists
        largely of the capability to view from the inside ethical positions with
        which one disagrees, so that one understands the concerns motivating
        those positions, and, to some extent, appreciates their force. In this
        regard, students report that when discussing IEB questions before a competition,
        team members often begin from sharply divergent positions, but as discussion
        proceeds one or the other of two outcomes tends to result. Sometimes
        differences of opinion narrow with further discussion. In many instances,
        however, this does not happen, and yet the students still succeed in
        reaching agreement upon what their response will be to a given question
        if asked it at the IEB. This is because the team members who personally
        disagree with the response have come to view it as a defensible position
        that a reasonable and responsible person could hold.</p>
      <p>Finally, participation in the IEB, we believe, can reinforce a student's
        sense of ethical commitment. Although the natural competitive inclination
        of students undoubtedly sparks their interest in the IEB, in our experience
        this factor has not dominated the event. We like to think that at the
        conclusion of the IEB the contestants, judges, moderators, and audience
        experience a sense of coming together, characteristic of joint participation
        in a significant and valued activity, guided by shared standards with
        which the participants deeply identify. This is the way it ought to be
        in our judgment, and the way we want to keep it.</p>
      <p>We believe strongly that the IEB fills a unique niche in practical and
        professional ethics education. It is also great fun. To receive more
