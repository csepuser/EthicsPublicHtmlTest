            <br>
          <strong>Case #1: Drug Companies Funding FDA Research</strong></p>
		<p>Since 1971, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had shown interest in
		  charging &#8220;user fees&#8221; as a way to speed their review process and
		  augment their funding provided by Congress. In 1992, Congress passed the
		  Pharmaceutical Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), which allowed the FDA to charge
		  drug manufacturers a &#8220;user fee&#8221; to provide funds for FDA reviewers
		  to complete their reviews within 12 months. The median drug review time was
		  approximately 33 months in the early 1990&#8217;s, which drug companies and
		  patients awaiting new life-saving drugs, believed was too long. HIV and AIDs
		  patients were pushing for opportunities to move new drugs more quickly through
		  the long approval process. Soon after the PDUFA went into effect, the average
		  review time dropped from 33 months to less than 12.</p>
		<p>In addition to the user fees, the majority of the research on new pharmaceuticals
		  is performed by the pharmaceutical companies themselves. The FDA engages
		  a 12-step process in the approval of new pharmaceuticals; both the
		  initial pre clinical trials (those not performed on humans) and later
		  human testing
		  are performed either by the pharmaceutical companies themselves or
		  by subcontractors for the pharmaceutical companies. After pre clinical
		  trials, the FDA orders
		  local institutional review boards (IRBs) to determine the procedures
		  (including dosage, measurement, and informed consent) required for
		  human testing of
		  a given drug. After 3 stages of human testing, FDA officials then review
		  the results provided to them by the pharmaceutical companies in several
		  steps in order to ensure product safety. The user fees are aimed at
		  speeding the
		  review process, by providing greater resources to the FDA so they can
		  complete the reviews in a timely manner.</p>
		<p>User fees, combined with the 12-step approval process, are aimed at providing
		  safe, but quick approval of new medications. Those who oppose drug manufacturers
		  paying for quick drug reviews fear that reviews conducted to meet a specific
		  deadline risks having errors and believe that the practice gives control
		  over FDA to the pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, critics of the FDA
		  approval process have long noted the conflict of interest created when drug
		  companies provide the information upon which approval of their own drugs
		  is based. Marcia Angell, editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine
		  from 1999 to 2000 believes &#8220;oversight of clinical trials is too important
		  to leave in the hands of drug companies and their agents.&#8221;</p>
	  <p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a trade
		  association for the drug industry, believes strongly in the process and supports
		  the use of IRBs as a safe method to move along the approval process and save
		  sick patients awaiting new drug options. &#8220;The vast majority of clinical
		  trials conducted in the United States meet high ethical standards. The U.S.
		  regulatory system is the world&#8217;s gold standard, and the Food and Drug
		  Administration has the best product safety record.&#8221; <br>
          <strong><br>
  Case #2: Churches as Polling Places</strong></p>
		<p>Political philosophers agree that the single most crucial requirement for
		  a democracy to function is for those who are governed to have a say in how
		  they are governed. This is usually accomplished by a significant portion
		  of voters regularly participating in elections. Historically, one of the
		  devices used to discourage segments of the population from voting has been
		  to make polling places difficult to reach. To guard against such manipulation
		  of the electorate, most municipalities work to distribute polling places
		  in such a way as to make access easy for all voters. </p>
		<p>That access includes not only proximity to voters&#8217; places of residence
		  or employment, but also ease of entry and exit, sufficient space for voting
		  booths and other paraphernalia, and public right of entry for the period
		  of voting. That generally excludes places of commerce and industry because
		  the comings and goings of voters would surely interfere with normal business.
		  Similarly most governmental structures would find voting operations interfered
		  with regular operations. Schools seem to work well because they have areas
		  (like gymnasia) that can be used for an occasional day without severely disrupting
		  education. But in some locales, schools are not distributed uniformly across
		  populations.</p>
		<p>The other semi-public structures whose ordinary functions are not seriously
		  impeded by elections are places of worship. Most congregations welcome non-member
		  visitors, have large, usable, open spaces, and do not have significant numbers
		  of congregants using their facilities on Tuesdays &#8211; the most common
		  election day. </p>
		<p>But a problem occurs when individuals are uncomfortable going into houses
		  of worship other than their own. An observant Jew, Rob Meltzer was deeply
		  troubled by the prospect of entering a Methodist church and has since voted
		  by absentee ballot while trying to persuade local officials to move polling
		  stations in the church and a Catholic school to secular sites, saying the
		  current locations infringe on voters' constitutional rights. Some are also

		  concerned that as churches often have political agendas, making churches
		  into polling places increases the amount of influence a church could wield,
		  consciously or subconsciously, over those voting in the church.</p>
		<p>Selectmen (those in charge of the logistics of polling places) in the Boston
		  area have refused, saying the practice is widely accepted and that logistics
		  make the church the only sensible spot. They argue that proof that the location
		  of polling places in religious structures does not interfere with a voter&#8217;s
		  rights is proven by Meltzer&#8217;s own case. According to his claim he has
		  been free to vote by absentee ballot (and has done so) so as to avoid the &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; location. </p>
	  <p> <br>
	    <strong>Case #3: Adjunct Faculty </strong></p>
		<p> In the 1970&#8217;s, economic and political factors gave rise to the current,
		  business-style model of the university. As with any business, output and
		  bottom line were the focus of management, in this case, university administration
		  officials. Regular faculty are expected not only to teach and publish, but
		  also to write proposals and manage grant programs, serve on committees, and
		  direct students&#8217; research. Their classroom teaching loads typically
		  include only two to four courses a year, at least half of these consisting
		  of seminars where advanced students present their work. </p>
		<p>Due to the many roles played by full-time faculty and the drastic increases
		  in enrollment over the past decades, adjunct professors or instructors have
		  become much more common. Typically they are well-qualified, with Master&#8217;s
		  degrees or doctorates in the field they teach. Because of adjuncts, instruction
		  can be offered to students at a discount, and tenure-track faculty can pursue
		  their grants and publications. Administrators tend to believe that hiring
		  adjuncts is their panacea; without these hires, they claim, tuition and fees
		  would skyrocket and research would come to a standstill, with the return
		  of professors to lecture halls.</p>
		<p>Adjuncts tend to be paid low on a university&#8217;s scale; from around
		  $1,000 per class per semester to a livable salary in some cases. Because
		  adjuncts often are employed to teach introductory courses that are required
		  and cover broad topics, their class size is generally large, which may mean
		  greater burden on the adjunct in evaluating student performance. They may
		  teach one course per term, or several courses, up to just-below the limit
		  for full-time employment. Since they are employed on a class-by-class basis
		  (and may therefore be viewed as more &#8220;temporary&#8221;), they are monitored
		  more closely than regular faculty. Often, adjuncts teach at two or more colleges
		  at a time. Adjuncts are usually required to hold minimal office hours, and
		  may be inaccessible to students unless they choose to volunteer time for
		  consultation.</p>
		<p>Even with the lack of benefits, some adjuncts feel they make a decent living
		  while doing the work they love. Teaching adjunct can provide flexibility.
		  Most adjuncts would prefer to have tenure-track posts, but some like to be
		  free from the bureaucratic restraints of full-time academic employment. Some
		  believe the teach-and-go routine serves their family life better. Others
		  may work full-time at another type of job. Often, a full-time professor may
		  teach adjunct at a nearby college, either to help that school with its staffing
		  shortages, or to supplement his income. </p>
		<p>The flexibility and transient nature of adjunct faculty are viewed by some
		  as tantamount to acting as a &#8220;scab&#8221; on a picket line. If all
		  potential adjuncts refused to teach individual courses, universities might
		  be forced to hire more full-time faculty and provide benefits to those who
		  fill the positions. However, the adjunct positions are often filled by doctoral
		  students attempting to gain additional classroom experience before searching
		  for a full-time position post-graduation, and thus, they are only interested
		  in a small course load.</p>
	  <p> <br>
	    <strong>Case #4: Erosion of Native Art</strong></p>
	  <p>Alpine Imports, an international corporation that distributes native crafts
		  throughout the United States, has found a new production site in Guatemala.
		  Alpine has been certified by groups such as the Fair Trade Resource Network
		  for its commitment to paying fair wages and preventing inhumane working conditions
		  in the areas from which it purchases its products. Labor in Guatemala is
		  relatively cheap, even with a living wage, and moreover, the corporation
		  has found that native artisans there have a distinctive style that should
		  market well in the United States. In particular, Alpine is considering Kaqchikel
		  clothing for dolls, handmade in the Guatemalan village of San Lucas Toliman.
		  The clothing fits several generic doll figures, including American Girl&#8482; dolls. <br>
		  Alpine Imports has researched the market and determined that import
		  motif stores conspicuously lack toy divisions, and therefore it has little
		  background as to what items succeed. It hopes, however, that its venture
		  into this new arena will pay off. Managers at Alpine ordered an initial batch
		  of 1,000 dresses to be produced by the Kaqchikel workers for distribution
		  in Alpine stores throughout the United States. Managers project the cost
		  of the dresses to be about $5 a piece, and the retail price will be $15.
		  If these doll dresses are a success, they could mean a substantial profit
		  for Alpine Imports and a sustained relationship between Alpine and the Kaqchikel.<br>
		  The shipment of doll clothing arrived to the Alpine warehouse on time,
		  and was distributed; managers anxiously awaited sales results. The first
		  reports showed moderate sales; however, the response was not as strong as
		  the marketing department had hoped. Alpine attempted some advertising of
		  the dolls in local markets, to raise awareness of the new product, but still
		  sales lagged behind expectations. Executives at Alpine began to realize that
		  children are often subject to national advertising ploys coupled with strong
		  peer pressure, and that if they want to realize success in the toy market,
		  their strategy has to change. They assessed the situation and decided that
		  the clearest options would be to cut their losses and discontinue the relationship
		  with the Kaqchikel people, work on stronger marketing ploys, or to suggest
		  changes to the design of the dresses. Alpine is in no danger of bankruptcy
		  based on the sale of Kaqchikel dresses, but as a business, they strive to
		  maintain fiscal viability, and thus, must keep the success of this product
		  in mind.<br>
          <br>
        <strong>Case #5: Payday Loans</strong></p>
		<p> In recent years, businesses have appeared that offer cash advance &#8220;payday&#8221; loans
		  in many urban areas and smaller towns. These businesses usually operate out
		  of storefronts in strip malls and offer small advances ($300-$500) to people
		  who need money quickly, usually at a high interest rate. Their clientele
		  tends to be employed, but poor or lower middle-class.</p>
		<p> In order to receive the loan, the client writes a post-dated check to the
		  company for the amount he or she wants as an advance plus a fee, usually
		  about $15-$25 per $100. So if someone is being advanced $400, he or she writes
		  a check for between $460 and $500. On payday, the client deposits his or
		  her paycheck and the payday loan company deposits the post-dated check, effectively
		  ending the loan. Clients do not always have enough money in their accounts
		  to cover the post-dated check, so they are also offered the option of rolling
		  the loan amount over to the next pay period. In order to take advantage of
		  this offer, the same fee is charged: $15-$25 per $100 borrowed. This effectively
		  doubles the interest rate of the loan, so for the aforementioned $400 loan
		  spread across two pay periods, the fee would be between $120 and $200&#8212;half
		  of the amount borrowed in the worst case.</p>
		<p> Interestingly, a study by the Center for Responsible Lending found that
		  the vast majority of these loans are not made to one-time emergency borrowers.
		  It found that 91% of all payday loans are made to borrowers with five or
		  more payday loans per year. Furthermore, most payday borrowers go to more
		  than one lender, dramatically increasing their total number of payday loans
		  per year. Only 1% of all payday loans are made to emergency borrowers. </p>
		<p> Church groups and anti-poverty organizations claim that these businesses
		  lure people in with offers of quick money to handle important payments, but
		  aim to get people caught up in the system of rolling over loans. They say
		  that such high fees would be immoral to charge to anyone, but it is especially
		  heartless to charge them to people without the financial means to pay the
		  loans back and get back on their feet. These groups have fought for legislation
		  restricting the fees and ability to rollover loans from one paycheck to the
		  other as well as legislation that would crack down on companies&#8217; ability
		  to ignore current outstanding debt when giving out the loans. The payday
		  loan industry is profitable and can afford to devote a percentage of those
		  profits to opposing such legislation. Additionally, those who would benefit
		  from regulation of the industry, the working poor and lower middle-class,
		  are less likely to vote, write their congressperson, or donate to campaigns. </p>
	  <p> Payday loan advocates counter that they provide a valuable service to those
		  who need money sooner than their employers can provide. It is not their fault
		  that people get caught in the web of escalating fees, but rather the temptation
		  that consumer society creates for people to live beyond their means. Without
		  their services, advocates claim that job terminations, unpaid bills, evictions,
		  and mortgage foreclosures would soar, swelling the welfare rolls and increasing
		  taxes. They claim that existing regulations already require them to make
		  very clear how much people will pay for the loan and to limit people&#8217;s
		  ability to freely choose such fees is to treat them as children rather than
		  adults who are capable of reigning in their own spending.<br>
          <strong><br>
            Case #6: Revisionist History&#8212;Deleting Bad Acts</strong></p>
		<p> They say that history is written by the winners, but others are finding
		  that they have a say in what future generations learn about a country&#8217;s
		  past. Recently Japan&#8217;s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, has tested how far
		  that &#8220;say&#8221; can go.</p>
		<p> In March 2007, the Japanese Ministry of Education ordered that publishers
		  delete passages from history textbooks that claimed Imperial Army officers
		  ordered citizens to commit mass suicide when Okinawa was about to fall to
		  American forces near the end of the war. Responses to the ministry&#8217;s
		  order have taken the form of changing active verbs to passive ones in order
		  to describe mass suicides. Instead of saying, &#8220;There were some people
		  who were forced to commit suicide by the Japanese Army,&#8221; one textbook
		  now reads, &#8220;There were some people who were driven to mass suicide.&#8221; Opposing
		  the new official stance on the suicides are eye-witness accounts of Okinawans
		  (now Japanese citizens) who claim Japanese soldiers gave them grenades with
		  orders to use the grenades to take their own lives should the Americans win. </p>
		<p> This is not the first time modern Japan has been accused of &#8220;whitewashing&#8221; history.
		  Abe was recently in the international spotlight for claiming that the Japanese
		  military had not forced women, many Korean, into sexual slavery during World
		  War II despite testimonials from witnesses and victims alike. The remarks
		  drew strong condemnation from South Korean foreign minister Song Min-soon,
		  who said that, &#8220;&#8230;problems over perceptions of history are making
		  it difficult to move South Korean-Japanese relations forward.&#8221;</p>
		<p> Other Asian leaders have expressed similar concerns about Japan&#8217;s
		  version of events especially in China where hostility towards the Japanese
		  has lingered long after Japanese involvement in China during World War II.
		  Japanese and Chinese historians are famously at odds over the number of civilians
		  killed in the Nanking Massacre with estimates ranging from several hundred
		  to 100,000 to 300,000. </p>
		<p> Overall, the worries of other Asian nations could be summed up as a concern
		  that the truth about Japan&#8217;s actions in World War II will not be learned
		  by future generations of Japanese students, thus eliminating barriers to
		  a resurgent Japanese nationalism. Those who do not learn the mistakes of
		  the past have no chance to learn from the mistakes of the past and stand
		  a greater chance of repeating them. In the background of these arguments
		  are other echoes of Japanese nationalism, such as new nationalist &#8220;manga&#8221; comic
		  books and Abe&#8217;s move to bolster the Defense Agency, reigniting fears
		  that Japan may change its Constitution to create an army for purposes other
		  than defense.</p>
		<p> The revisionists argue that Japan need not paint such a &#8220;masochistic&#8221; view
		  of its own history, and that constant reminders of Japanese militarism and
		  atrocities only serve to keep a national attitude of guilt for events that
		  current generations are no more responsible for than current generations
		  of Germans are responsible for Nazi atrocities in Europe. A more positive,
		  less guilt-ridden view of history has been sought by most if not all nations
		  at one time or another. Whether there is an ethical duty to maintain an accurate
		  historical account, or whether history is just one of many tools leaders
		  can use to lead their people is not merely an issue faced by contemporary
		  Japan. Chinese textbooks have also been changed recently to de-emphasize
		  communism, relegating Chairman Mao Zedong (a former focal point of recent
		  Chinese history) to a section on etiquette. United States textbooks also
		  face strong criticism from historians and Native Americans for their depiction
		  of Christopher Columbus and the other &#8220;discoverers&#8221; of North
		  America. Japan claims its current interests lie in leading its citizens towards
		  the future in a positive way, rather than dwelling incessantly on every detail
		  of a troubled past.</p>
	  <p> <br>
	    <strong>Case #7: Corporate Sponsorship of College Sports</strong></p>
		<p>A college athlete&#8217;s uniform bears the endorsement of various sportswear
		  companies. The student learns of certain ethical violations tied one of the
		  companies, Nike. She finds wearing the uniform objectionable because it looks
		  as though she supports Nike. Refusing to wear the little swoosh might jeopardize
		  contracts with the uniform providers and interfere with team identity. She
		  asks that the symbol be removed from her school&#8217;s uniforms, but is
		  refused. She values her team, but wonders if she should continue to play
		  on the team if she objects to the sponsors. </p>
		<p> Nike, an American company based in Oregon, has 500,000 employees in 55
		  countries. It has been reported that Nike&#8217;s subcontractors in Asia
		  violate local labor laws, pay below minimum wages, do not provide safe working
		  conditions, oppose unionization efforts and tolerate child labor. Apparently,
		  children in Pakistan stitch Nike&#8217;s soccer balls for as little as 6
		  cents per hour. A U.S. network of child advocates has repeatedly demanded
		  identification and removal of all child laborers, arguing instead for programs
		  of education and rehabilitation for them. However, in many nations throughout
		  the world child labor is a necessary evil &#8211; the family needs the children&#8217;s
		  income to survive. The Christian Science Monitor reported that closing the
		  factories in Pakistan over the child-labor issue would cause economic distress
		  and add to human misery in Pakistan.</p>
		<p> Nike&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Phil Knight, stated, &#8220;Whether
		  you like Nike or don't like Nike, good corporations are the ones that lead
		  these countries out of poverty,&#8221; in an interview with the Washington
		  Post. He argued that Nike&#8217;s investment in Asian business has helped
		  countries like Taiwan and Japan. The article also notes that workers in many
		  Nike factories actually like the work. Despite these endorsements, Nike has
		  suffered serious public relations problems based on its labor practices.
		  Nike has invested in improving their image, and has also adopted a Labor
		  Practices Department to investigate mistreatment. The company&#8217;s measures
		  to improve the working conditions, however, have been called nothing more
		  than a public relations campaign.</p>
	  <p>The question also arises about whether US activists should focus condemnation
		  of child labor in other countries when in the United States child labor,
		  illegal as it is, still exists. For example, Latino children are known to
		  work in the agriculture industry as members of migrant farm worker families,
		  sometimes under appalling working conditions. There is little enforcement
		  of the time and effort that children in America are forced to work in family
		  businesses, and little review of the tasks that they are expected to perform
		  or the pay that they receive. <br>

          Case #8: Ethics Officers Getting Businesses off the Hook?</strong></p>
	  <p>In late June of 2007 Kevin Hunsaker, former Ethics Officer of Hewlett-Packard,
		  completed 96 hours of community service as part of a plea bargain entered
		  into earlier in the year to drop charges of misdemeanor fraud brought against
		  him, along with several other defendants, by the Attorney General of California.
		  The charges grew out of disclosures that an investigator, hired by Hewlett
		  Packard to discover the source of leaks to the press about boardroom meetings
		  had posed as another person to obtain phone records of reporters and board
		  members. </p>
	  <p>In an interview with Bloomberg.com, Professor James Post states, &#8220;The
		  failure at HP was a failure of ethical leadership, not headcount.&#8221; Post,
		  a professor of management at Boston University, further states, &#8220;The
		  fact that they had only six [ethics officials] on staff before the 2006 scandal
		  suggests an overworked staff, but I doubt that a few more people in the ethics
		  department would have deterred the board chair, the head of ethics, and the
		  general counsel from their chosen investigatory path.&#8221;</p>
		<p>According to Forbes.com, &#8220;chief ethics officers and compliance officers
		  have become trendy in recent years, but some experts fear they act mainly
		  as window dressing.&#8221; Chief ethics officers began appearing in defense
		  contractor organizational structures in 1986, when a self governing Defense
		  Industry Initiative was created as a recommendation of the Packard Commission
		  championed by President Reagan. </p>
		<p>Companies began creating more chief ethics officers in 1991, when the Federal
		  Sentencing Guidelines (FSG) for corporations went into effect. When companies
		  employ &#8220;effective&#8221; ethics compliance programs, penalties for
		  ethical violations can be reduced to 5% of fines levied. Penalties can be
		  increased up to 400% where evidence demonstrated that an effective program
		  did not exist. </p>
		<p>Many believe having a chief ethics officer is a &#8220;requirement for good
		  governance.&#8221; But according to Efrem Grail, ethics officers are sometimes &#8220;just
		  a mask for the company to hide behind.&#8221; Grail is an attorney specializing
		  in corporate investigations at Reed Smith. According to Forbes, most corporations
		  hire an attorney to fill the chief ethics officer position &#8211; while
		  attorneys generally receive training in professional responsibility, they
		  are not specialists in ethics. </p>
		<p>The New York Times reported an email exchange between HP&#8217;s officer,
		  Hunsaker, and Anthony R. Gentilucci, the head of HP&#8217;s global investigations
		  unit. Hunsaker asked whether the spying tactics used by a subcontractor were &#8220;above
		  board,&#8221; but later noted, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have asked.&#8221;<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Case #9: Differential Undergraduate Tuition</strong></p>
		<p>Many
            public institutions have seen stagnant or decreasing budgets, and
            so are now asking students to shoulder more of the financial
            burden through increased tuitions. Sometimes, the amount they are
            being asked to pay depends on their majors. At some institutions,
            students in engineering and business pay more for their undergraduate
          degrees than students completing degrees in liberal arts or education.</p>
		<p>The University of Wisconsin approved a tuition differential for students
		  enrolled in the Bachelor of Business Administration program or earning a
		  Certificate in Business beginning in fall 2007. The rationale offered for
		  the increased tuition is that the costs of business education are rising
		  faster than the university&#8217;s resource base and that the demand for
		  those programs has grown and that higher tuition would help sustain the quality
		  and expand the size of the business programs.</p>
		<p>Higher tuition for business or engineering schools can be justified based
		  on the higher costs of educating students in those disciplines. Business
		  school faculty often command higher salaries than those in other colleges
		  due to lucrative opportunities outside academia. Engineering students require
		  expensive laboratory space and equipment, which needs to be constantly maintained
		  and updated. The differential tuition policy can also be defended on the
		  basis of higher starting salaries for graduates in those majors. </p>
		<p>It can also be argued that differential tuition forces qualified students
		  from economically disadvantaged backgrounds to make career choices based
		  on affordability, rather than aptitude or interest. This is contrary to the
		  societal goal of providing equal access to higher education to every qualified
		  member of the community. Moreover, students graduating from university programs
		  that charge higher tuition may choose higher paying jobs in the private sector
		  to pay off loans, rather than choosing service positions such as careers
		  in public service.</p>
		<p>Many schools including most of the Big Ten schools have a tuition differential
		  at least for undergraduate business majors. </p>

	    <strong>Case #10: The Buddhas of Bamiyan</strong></p>
		<p>The two huge Buddhas of Bamiyan, which stood 15 stories and 10 stories respectively,
		  had survived wars and the elements for 1500 years. Their cultural importance
		  had even resulted in Genghis Khan refraining from causing them harm. In March
		  2001, however, they fell victim to the Taliban. The Taliban government ordered
		  explosives placed at the feet of these statues; over weeks of repeated shelling,
		  they reduced the sacred relics of central Afghanistan to rubble ranging in
		  size from 90 ton boulders to dust.</p>
		<p>Religion is most often cited as the primary reason for destruction. The
		  pre-Islamic artifacts were reportedly destroyed as dictated by Islamic law
		  to prevent the adoration of idols. </p>
		<p>Cultural experts are divided over what should happen with the Buddhas and
		  the Bamiyan site in a post-Taliban Afghanistan. With the focus on what was
		  one of Afghanistan&#8217;s primary tourist attractions, suggestions include
		  rebuilding the Buddhas by anastylosis &#8211; i.e. reassembly from the remaining
		  fragments, incorporating new materials where necessary, supervised by qualified
		  achaeologists. Some favor funding preservation of the site, but leaving the
		  rubble as evidence of the cultural destruction. Some argue for a solar- and
		  wind-powered laser system that will project the images of the Buddhas on
		  the cliff where they stood. Some archaeologists are delighted with the new
		  findings that have been possible only because of the destruction, and want
		  to use this opportunity to further dissect the site for the historical knowledge
		  that can be derived. </p>
		<p>Considering that the population of Afghanistan is poor and war-torn and
		  that present-day Afghans are Muslim rather than Buddhists, others suggest
		  that money that would fund anything related to the Bamiyan Buddhas would
		  be better spent on Afghan children. </p>
		<p><strong>
  Case #11: Women&#8217;s Work</strong></p>
		<p>What is a mom? &#8220;Housekeeper, day care center teacher, cook, computer
		  operator, laundry machine operator, janitor, facilities manager, van driver,
		  CEO, and psychologist,&#8221; according to Salary.com. And, what is she worth?
		  According to that website, &#8220;If paid, Stay at Home Moms would earn $134,121
		  annually &#8230;Working Moms would earn $85,876 annually for the &#8220;mom
		  job&#8221; portion of their work, in addition to their actual &#8220;work
		  job&#8221; salary.</p>
		<p>But of course, moms aren&#8217;t paid. Indeed, &#8220;On a worldwide scale,
		  the UN has found that women do two-thirds of the work in the world, receive
		  less than 5 percent of the world&#8217;s income, and own less than one percent
		  of the world&#8217;s real property,&#8221; according to a recent article
		  in the Ottawa Citizen. Statistics Canada reports that &#8220;unpaid work
		  took up 831 hours of an average man&#8217;s year, whereas it&#8217;s an average
		  of 1,482 hours for a woman.&#8221;</p>
		<p>The lack of payment for traditional woman&#8217;s work creates a variety
		  of concerns beyond basic equity and fairness, said author Penney Kome. </p>
		<p>First, the work, if performed by paid assistants, counts in a nation&#8217;s
		  Gross National Product (GNP); unpaid labor by domestic partners does not.
		  The fact that the work is often unpaid decreases the value that society places
		  on it as demonstrated by the low wages paid day care workers, housekeepers,
		  and maintenance workers. In addition, unpaid workers are not entitled to
		  benefits provided those workers who perform the same duties for pay, such
		  as &#8220;unemployment insurance, pensions, or social assistance.&#8221; Last,
		  unpaid domestic labor can be ignored or usurped by focus on market value.
		  According to Kome, &#8220;[S]ubsistence agriculture is specifically excluded
		  from IMF and World Bank Calculations. Therefore, IMF and World Bank projects
		  often evict mothers and their families from small patches of arable land &#8211; where
		  they are, at least, reasonably well nourished &#8211; to create huge plantations
		  with cash crops. The nation&#8217;s GDP (Gross Domestic Product) flourishes,
		  but the local children go hungry.&#8221; </p>

	    <strong>Case #12: Iraqi Translators</strong></p>
		<p>One of the first things most people learn in school is not to be a tattletale.
		  No matter how appropriate it might be to let the authorities know what is
		  happening, everyone learns that the consequences of &#8220;telling&#8221; are
		  severe. Such people are viewed as &#8220;collaborating with the system&#8221; and
		  putting their own personal advancement ahead of their friends and community.</p>
		<p>Throughout human history people seen as collaborators are, at best, ostracized;
		  at worst they are killed. During and after World War II, women who fraternized
		  with Nazi forces in order to survive and sustain their families were beaten,
		  shunned, and had their heads shaved as a sign of their &#8220;guilt.&#8221; Vietnamese
		  who worked for the U.S. government or military were the first people imprisoned,
		  tortured or killed after the U.S. left their country. </p>
		<p>The West lacks fluent speakers of most non-western tongues. Few westerners
		  have any significant knowledge of history, culture, and society outside Europe
		  and the U.S. (Even knowledge there is seldom incisive.) This is especially
		  true in the Middle East. With hundreds of thousands of western soldiers and
		  civilians on the ground in Iraq, Afghanistan and their surroundings, the
		  ability to communicate reliably with natives is necessary for survival. For
		  that reason one of the most effective ways for natives with linguistic skills
		  to support their families has been to become translators for government,
		  business and the military. But this employment is not without risk. As in
		  previous conflicts, translators risk being seen as collaborating with the &#8220;occupiers&#8221; and
		  to date more than 250 Iraqis who have worked for allied forces or western
		  businesses have been executed, often quite brutally, by factions who oppose
		  the U.S. presence there. Estimates suggest that a similar number of translators&#8217; family
		  members have suffered as well.</p>
		<p>One of the reasons translators still work for the U.S., despite threats
		  on their lives and those of their families is offers of political asylum
		  from countries such as the U.S. Translators conclude they only need to hide
		  their identities long enough to make enough money for their new lives in
		  the States. Others identify with the stated goals of the U.S. occupation
		  and believe that translating might help ease tensions between rival factions,
		  paving the way for non-violent political solutions to the country&#8217;s
		  problems&#8212;perhaps even paving the way for a Western-style democracy.</p>
		<p>It appears, however, that western governments are not protecting those who
		  have helped them. For instance, the U.S. State Department processes applications
		  for refugee translators. These translators who have worked for the U.S. are
		  given preferential treatment when the State Department considers them for
		  immigration. Despite such preference, the process requires that the translators
		  have already fled Iraq. Even after they have fled, the process of reviewing
		  their applications is often very slow &#8220;for security reasons.&#8221; Moreover,
		  many who have gone through the difficulty and cost of fleeing Iraq cannot
		  even apply for asylum since they do not qualify as &#8220;refugees&#8221; according
		  to the United Nations definition (which is the one the U.S. currently employs
		  in its considerations).</p>
		<p>Those individuals who worked with the U.S. have routinely had their applications
		  for immigration (even as seekers of political asylum) refused by the very
		  societies they have assisted. Justifications offered for such rejections
		  include concern that some applicants might turn out to be sleeper agents,
		  that the allies cannot afford to grant exceptions to their established immigration
		  laws, or that the risks to such people are not grave. Even without outright
		  denial, the processing of applications, which often takes many months, leads
		  many to turn back to Iraq because the wait creates an insurmountable hurdle.</p>

	    <strong>Case #13: Intelligent Debate about Intelligent Design </strong></p>
		<p>Public school boards in at least 19 states have, over the past two decades,
		  debated the teaching of &#8220;creationism&#8221; about the origins of biological
		  species in tandem with teaching evolution. There are various creationist
		  theories about how species came about, but all require some kind of intervention
		  in (if not outright replacement of) natural history by a being of great power
		  and intelligence. Frequently, this being is the Judeo-Christian God and the
		  method of creation is as outlined in the book of Genesis in the Old Testament.
		  Creationism supporters claim that teaching evolution, without offering creationist
		  accounts as an alternative, is a denial of their Constitutional right to
		  have their views expressed systematically in the educational system. The
		  movement makes no effort to disguise its political motivations in its drive
		  to include the Biblical account of creation, or some variation of it, such
		  as &#8220;intelligent design,&#8221; in public school biology classes. </p>
		<p>Many biology teachers in public schools and colleges happen to believe in
		  Biblical accounts of the beginning of the universe and of life. Other biologists
		  believe that adding the creationists&#8217; perspective balances the consideration,
		  gives a fair treatment to different points of view, and helps the students
		  with their skills in critical thinking. Others, however, feel that they are
		  being forced to violate the Constitutional separation of church and state
		  or that they are being asked to present a non-scientific theory as biological
		  science.</p>
		<p>A growing number of biology teachers in the lower grades through high school
		  have decided simply to omit evolution from their course syllabi, despite
		  that fact that the American Association for the Advancement of Science has
		  stated unequivocally that knowledge of the basic concepts of evolution must
		  be included in high school science competencies. These abstaining teachers
		  argue that they can never cover everything, so they might as well omit the
		  topics that encourage discussion and controversy, which could endanger their
		  jobs. School principals and superintendents have been inclined recently to
		  support, and even to suggest, this strategy of skipping the topic of evolution.
		  Physics and geology teachers have begun to weigh into the debate as well.
		  They object that creationism conflicts with the big bang theory, accepted
		  by virtually all physicists, and that some versions of creationism contend
		  that the universe has existed for only six thousand years.</p>
		<p>Some educational policymakers have encouraged the inclusion of &#8220;creationism
		  vs. evolution&#8221; in literature or social science courses, rather than
		  in biology classes where evolution currently appears in curricula. Their
		  argument is that liberal arts courses would be more likely to study the different
		  perspectives critically and historically, and in their sociopolitical contexts. </p>
		<p>School boards across the country have opted for creationism in a de facto
		  way, by selecting science textbooks only if they include creationism. Some
		  districts require stickers appended to their biology textbooks, stating that
		  evolution is only a theory and that there are also viable religious accounts
		  of the origins of life. Federal suits regarding the stickers have occurred
		  in several states. The Kansas school board has included knowledge about the
		  concept of intelligent design as part of high school exit examinations in
		  Kansas.</p>

	    <strong>Case #14: Jamaica and the World Bank</strong></p>
		<p>After years of unwise spending following British colonial rule, Jamaica
		  finds itself deeply in debt to other countries. Jamaica owes $4.5 billion
		  to international moneylenders like the World Bank, the International Monetary
		  Fund (IMF), and the Inter-American Development Bank. The World Bank demands
		  that Jamaica undertake economic reforms as a condition of the loans. One
		  such reform is the opening of its markets to foreign vegetables and fruits,
		  which are sold at much lower prices than Jamaican-produced crops. The hope
		  is that decreasing the debt will allow the economy to grow, raising many
		  Jamaicans out of poverty. But in a largely agricultural economy, Jamaica's
		  farmers find themselves increasingly out of work.</p>
		<p>A similar situation involves Jamaica&#8217;s banana industry. Forced to
		  compete with strong U.S.-based companies like Dole and Chiquita, which grow
		  bananas on a large scale in Central America, Jamaica&#8217;s banana production
		  has plummeted. The number of small banana farmers on the island has dropped
		  from 45,000 to 3,000.</p>
	  <p>The World Bank&#8217;s restrictions aim to deregulate the Jamaican economy,
		  and integrate it into the global market. Thus far, however, the people of
		  Jamaica have suffered while moneylenders collect interest. Only 5% of the
		  money borrowed since 1977 has stayed inside Jamaica, with the bulk of the
		  funds dedicated to paying interest. The deregulation has hurt Jamaica&#8217;s
		  farmers, who find themselves increasingly impoverished.<br>
            <br>
          <strong>Case #15: Vacillating on Public Safety</strong></p>
		<p>Grave safety concerns with the Alaskan Way Viaduct and the SR 520 Bridge
		  in Washington State have been known and debated for the past decade. At the
		  current time (September, 2007), however, no public action is imminent to
		  address the concerns. Government agencies and regulators, the private sector,
		  including building owners, corporations, and merchants, professionals in
		  architecture, construction, engineering and related fields, and individuals
		  such as homeowners, consumers, farmers, residents and tax payers have all
		  played a role in perpetuating the present condition of vulnerability. Although
		  the above players may act with the best intentions, each may have only a
		  limited view of what mitigation should involve.</p>
		<p>Independent reviews have concluded that both the Alaskan Way Viaduct and
		  the SR 520 Bridge need to be replaced. In September 2000, Tammy Doherty,
		  Regional Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), stated
		  that &#8220;Seismic hazard in the Pacific Northwest has remained constant
		  this last decade, but seismic risk has increased dramatically, due to urban
		  development, aging infrastructure and vulnerable transportation corridors.
		  A FEMA study of earthquake risk across the United States indicates that 84
		  percent of this nation&#8217;s annual losses are expected to occur in California,
		  Oregon and Washington State.&#8221;</p>
		<p>More recently, based on an independent study, the Alaskan Way Viaduct was
		  found to have one of the lowest ratings possible for structural sufficiency.
		  State bridges are given a structural sufficiency rating to prioritize them
		  for rehabilitation and replacement. This rating is a number between 0 and
		  100 that reflects the physical condition of the bridge, load ratings and
		  importance of the bridge. A new bridge receives a rating of 100. When a bridge
		  is rated at 80, it becomes eligible for rehabilitation funding. A rating
		  of 50 warrants the bridge&#8217;s replacement with a new structure. The Viaduct
		  currently has a structural sufficiency rating of 9. </p>
		<p>In 2006, an expert review panel of the Alaskan Way Viaduct and SR 520 structures
		  concluded &#8220;The Washington State Legislature, the Puget Sound region,
		  and the people of Washington Stave have explored &#8211; diligently and faithfully &#8211; the
		  various possibilities for these much needed projects. The public thoughtfulness
		  that has characterized them for the past several years is admirable. But
		  additional deliberation of the merits of various options would be counterproductive.
		  If the decision making process is extended much further, inflation will diminish
		  the purchasing power of the funds that have already been committed. Meanwhile,
		  the existing viaduct and bridge will continue to deteriorate and inch closer
		  to catastrophic failure. The time has come to move forward with these vital
		  public works projects.&#8221;</p>
		<p>This same expert review panel commented &#8220;we are concerned about the
		  political fragmentation that seems to characterize these projects today.
		  It is not evident that either political will or public support has coalesced
		  around these projects. We see strongly held opinions and positions by political
		  leaders and stakeholders, but no process for reaching a conclusion. We see
		  a great need for strong political leadership now, to move these vital public-works
		  projects forward. The biggest risk these projects face is that of indecision
		  and vacillation by political and civic leaders. The safe, speedy rebuilding
		  of these roadways and infrastructure is critical, both to the Puget Sound
		  Region and the entire statewide transportation system &#8211; not only to
		  review congested highways, but also to prevent catastrophic damage in the
		  event of an earthquake or major storm.&#8221;</p>
		<p>In 2007, voters of Washington State voted against each of two separate (and
		  conflicting), one of which called for replacing the Viaduct with a similar
		  above ground structure, and the other of which would have involved building
		  a tunnel to replace the currently existing viaduct structure. After the failure
		  of both initiatives, the Governor of Washington has commissioned another
		  study consider alternatives for the replacement of the Viaduct and SR 520
		  Bridge.</p>
