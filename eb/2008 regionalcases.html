          <strong>Case 1: Medical Outsourcing</strong></p>
	      <p>As the cost of U.S. health care continues to rise to stratospheric
	        levels, Americans have begun to shop around for medical treatment in
	        foreign countries. While medical tourism is hardly novel (for years
	        Americans have sought discounted cosmetic surgery in places like Mexico,
	        Thailand and India), the interest in foreign medical treatment among
	        uninsured (or underinsured) individuals is, indeed, a burgeoning trend.</p>
	      <p>The main incentive for outsourcing health care procedures is the relatively
	        low cost and the high quality of care. Surgical services in places like
	        India and Thailand cost 70 to 80 percent less than in the United States.
	        For example, &#8220;[h]eart bypass surgery, which can cost more than
	        $130,000 in the United States, can be performed for $10,000 in India
	        and $19,000 in Turkey.&#8221; Patients receive high-quality care in
	        luxurious hospitals exclusively designed for tourists. As he recuperates
	        from mitral valve surgery in a luxurious Indian hospital suite (fully-equipped
	        with TV, computer, and mini-fridge), Robin Steeles can be assured that
	        all of his needs will be catered to &#8211; from his diet and his galling
	        skin rash to his craving for ice cream. Furthermore, according to John
	        Lancaster of The Washington Post, Indian private hospitals have a better
	        mortality rate for heart surgery than American hospitals. </p>
	      <p>Individual patients are not the only ones taking advantage of the overseas
	        medical market. Some companies (like Blue Ridge Paper Products of North
	        Carolina), faced with the hard choice between providing health coverage
	        and staying solvent, have tried sending their employees overseas for
	        medical treatment. And companies are not the only ones engaging in this
	        trend. For example, a West Virginia legislator has been developing a
	        bill that &#8220;would encourage state employees to have nonemergency
	        medical surgeries overseas.&#8221; Concomitantly, companies in Florida,
	        California and North Carolina have begun to specialize in selling medical
	        insurance and services that rely on foreign hospitals. </p>
	      <p>Because of its economic advantages, the outsourcing of medical procedures
	        has been widely touted as a panacea. However, outsourced medical procedures
	        are outside the reach of many working class Americans, and these procedures
	        have not been shown to lower the cost of healthcare in the U.S. These
	        concerns, coupled with the lack of continuity of care after patients
	        leave the foreign hospital, have raised concern among workers and patients&#8217; advocates. </p>
      <p>Additionally, while private, for-profit hospitals offer world-class,
	        high-tech medical procedures to foreign patients and wealthy Indian
	        nationals, most Indians are at the mercy of an under-funded and overstretched
	        public health care system. Urban areas cannot keep up with the demand
	        for treatment, and rural towns often have no medical facilities whatsoever.
	        While foreign patients pay for their care at Indian hospitals, their
	        fee only partially funds these private institutions. In the 1990&#8217;s
	        the Indian government shifted from funding public health care institutions
	        to supporting private health care facilities. Thus, foreign medical
	        tourists may be reaping the benefits of Indian public funding that has
	        been channeled to private medical institutions.</p><p></p>
       
          <strong>Case 2: Poverty Tours</strong></p>
	      <p>Many Americans may never know what life without modern amenities like
	        television, air conditioning, and indoor plumbing would be like. They
	        now have one way to get a glimpse of such a life &#8211; poverty tours,
	        also known as &#8220;poorism,&#8221; help those who want to see what
	        the poor life is like, if only for a short time and second hand. While
	        poverty tours may be found in many areas of the world, some of the most
	        famous are those of Rio de Janeiro, South Africa, and Mumbai. In a New
	        York Times article, Eric Weiner notes, &#8220;Slum tourism isn&#8217;t
	        for everyone. Critics charge that ogling the poorest of the poor isn&#8217;t
	        tourism at all. It&#8217;s voyeurism. The tours are exploitative, these
	        critics say, and have no place on an ethical traveler&#8217;s itinerary.&#8221; </p>
	      <p>However, tours may expose visitors not only to the extreme poverty
	        and dismal living conditions of the slums but to the entrepreneurial
	        spirit and hard work of slum dwellers, the cohesive family and community
	        structures, and other positive aspects of poor life. </p>
	      <p>Although some tourists might come to the slum tour for voyeuristic
	        reasons, exposure to the world&#8217;s poorest people can be a transformative
	        experience for many. The direct observation of the hard work and resilient
	        spirit of the poor can earn the respect of the well-to-do tourist and
	        possibly lead to charity and advocacy work. Harold Goodwin, director
	        of the International Center for Responsible Tourism in Leeds, England,
	        states &#8220;Ignoring poverty won&#8217;t make it go away. Tourism
	        is one of the few ways that you or I are ever going to understand what
	        poverty means. To just kind of turn a blind eye and pretend the poverty
	        doesn&#8217;t exist seems to me a very denial of our humanity.&#8221; </p>

      <p>
          <strong>Case 3: HOT Lanes</strong></p>
	      <p>Civil engineers have devised a solution to traffic problems on crowded
	        highways, converting High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV or carpool) lanes into
	        High Occupancy/Toll Lane, or HOT lanes. HOT lanes provide a designated
	        lane in which motorists driving alone can use if they pay a toll, allowing
	        them to avoid traffic delays in the adjacent regular lanes. HOT lanes
	        usually are combined with HOV lanes that have enough capacity to handle
	        more vehicles. Toll-paying drivers and toll-free carpools/vanpools share
	        the lane, increasing the number of total vehicles using the HOV/HOT
	        lane.</p>
	      <p>The appeal of the HOT lane concept is three-fold. HOT lanes expand
	        mobility options in congested urban areas by providing an opportunity
	        for reliable travel times for HOT lane users; HOT lanes generate a new
	        source of revenue which can be used to pay for transportation improvements,
	        including enhanced transit service; and HOT lanes improve the efficiency
	        of HOV resources. </p>
	      <p>States such as California, Texas, Minnesota, Colorado and Washington
	        have converted under-utilized HOV lanes to HOT lanes. A typical model
	        for HOT lanes uses variable pricing, whereby toll prices increase as
	        the available space during peak times decreases. The less space that
	        is available in the HOV lane, the higher the toll for a single occupant
	        vehicle. In this way, the optimum number of vehicles can be allowed
	        in the lane.</p>
	      <p>Proponents of HOT lanes cite studies showing traffic flow is improved
	        not only in the carpool lane, but in all general purpose lanes. These
	        studies suggest that even those who choose not to pay to use the HOT
	        lanes feel the benefit. According to a recent Minnesota Department of
	        Transportation User Panel Survey Report, support for HOT lanes was consistent
	        across all income groups. When asked a more specific question, &#8220;Do
	        HOT lanes only benefit the rich?&#8221; more high-income drivers said
	        yes (13%) than low-income drivers (11%). </p>
	      <p>Additionally, a number of expert groups support the concept of HOT
	        lanes. Civil engineers believe HOT lanes provide a more efficient way
	        to allocate a limited resource. Economists believe HOT lanes are clearly
	        an example of supply and demand. Environmentalists believe high tolls
	        will discourage driving and that revenues from tolls can be used for
	        more environmentally friendly public transportation options.</p>
      <p>Critics of HOT lanes have dubbed them &#8220;Lexus Lanes.&#8221; They
	        cite the unfairness of these Lexus Lanes to low and middle income commuters
	        who can&#8217;t afford the cost of tolls. They also argue that highways
	        are paid for through public funding and therefore all tax payers have
	        equal rights to use highways. As Don Guliford, an attorney from Mercer
	        Island who opposes HOT lanes, stated about the recent opening of a HOT
	        lane in Washington State, &#8220;Article I, Section 12 of our state
	        constitution clearly states: No law shall be passed granting to any
	        citizen, class of citizens, or corporations other than municipal, privileges
	        or immunities which upon the same terms shall not equally belong to
	        all citizens.&#8221; </p><p></p>
        <p><strong>Case 4: Protecting Pirates</strong></p>
	      <p>Piracy may seem like a thing of the past, but in the waters surrounding
	        Somalia, including the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, piracy
	        still runs strong. A U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Somalia
	        warns, &#8220;Merchant vessels, fishing boats, and recreational craft
	        all risk seizure by pirates and having their crews held for ransom&#8230;.
	        There have been numerous such incidents, highlighting the continuing
	        danger of maritime travel near the Horn of Africa.&#8221; While piracy
	        poses problems for individuals, governments are also faced with a difficulty
	        in dealing with the piracy problem. </p>
	      <p>The waters off Somalia appear to be the most dangerous in the world.
	        Last year, there were 31 attacks there and so far this year there have
	        been 23 attacks by Somali pirates. Experts worry not only about the
	        frequency of attacks but also about the skill and daring of the pirates,
	        some of whom claim to be protecting the country's maritime resources
	        from foreign exploitation. </p>
	      <p>U.N. food shipments have been jeopardized by the attacks. However,
	        the United States, France, and Great Britain have worked on a U.N. Security
	        Council resolution to increase member state patrols of the area, which
	        was approved in June. This measure has yet to prove effective, however.
	        Britain has thus found itself in the midst of an ethical dilemma with
	        regard to how to treat the pirates. According to author John S. Burnett,
	        if British soldiers capture the pirates, this may violate their human
	        rights. If they return the pirates to Somalia, the pirates may face
	        death or having their hands chopped off for theft under Islamic law.
	        And if the British fail to capture the pirates, the pirates may continue
	        to endanger travelers. Even bringing the pirates to Britain may unfairly
	        enable the pirates to claim asylum.</p>
	      <p>However, one way to decrease the Somali pirate attacks might be as
	        simple as to comply with international law. &#8220;There is some truth
	        in the pirates' claim that they are acting as a coastguard. Under international
	        law, a country's &#8216;exclusive economic zone&#8217; - where it has
	        sole rights over marine and mineral resources - extends 200 nautical
	        miles out to sea. Foreign ships are allowed to pass through these waters,
	        but not to fish without a permit.&#8221; </p>
	      <p>Despite this property right, many foreign fishing vessels end up off
	        the coast of Somalia, taking advantage of its &#8220;rich waters.&#8221; Due
	        to the fact that almost all of the foreign fishing boats are fishing
	        illegally, many pirate attacks go unreported. In fact, often &#8220;the
	        ransoms paid are regarded as legitimate fines, both by the pirates and
	        the ship-owners.&#8221; <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Case 5: Surreptitious DNA Gathering</strong></p>
	      <p>Law enforcement
              regularly seeks new methods to help locate and convict criminals,
              and one such method, surreptitious DNA gathering,
              recently has been used to solve decades-old murder cases. Journalist
              Jim O&#8217;Hara relates the story of Donald Sigsbee, a man convicted
              of raping and murdering Regina Reynolds. Sigsbee&#8217;s business
              card was found near the site where Regina Reynolds&#8217; body
              was dumped in 1975, but police lacked evidence to charge Sigsbee
              with the rape and murder of the 19-year-old college student.<br>
              Years later, in 2003, after police tested DNA found in the case,
              officers followed Sigsbee and his wife to a local Wendy&#8217;s
              restaurant. The detectives retrieved Sigsbee&#8217;s discarded
              drink cup and straw, and subsequent DNA testing linked Sigsbee
              to the rape and murder of Regina Reynolds. The evidence held up
              in court, leading to Sigsbee&#8217;s conviction for murder. He
              is now serving a 25 year-to-life prison sentence.<br>
              The technique used to gather the DNA samples that convicted Sigsbee
              is an example of &#8220;surreptitious sampling,&#8221; a practice
              gaining popularity among law enforcement. Defense lawyers argue
              that DNA gathered without a person&#8217;s consent violates the
              protection against unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth
              Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. </p>
	      <p></p>
      <p> <br>
        <strong>Case 6: Mosquito Teen Deterrent</strong></p>
	      <p> A device known as the Mosquito ultrasonic teenage deterrent has offered
	        police and business people an effective way to disperse groups of young
	        people. It emits a high pitch sound, around 17.5 to 18.5 kHz, that is
	        only audible to those under the age of 25. All humans suffer from a
	        loss of hearing, most notably occurring around the age of 65. However,
	        as early as 20 years of age, nearly every human can no longer hear the
	        18 to 20 kHz range due to a natural loss of hearing known as presbycusis.
	        Teens hearing sounds in this range find them annoying and generally
	        disperse within 8 to 10 minutes. Thus, the Mosquito can target a teenage
	        audience and cause them to leave an area rather quickly. </p>
	      <p>The technology of Mosquito has been touted as an effective way to help
	        prevent vandalism and loitering that can lead to other crimes or to
	        an interruption of business for retail store owners. Since Mosquito&#8217;s
	        sounds can be broadcast as far as 40 to 60 feet, large groups can be
	        targeted at one time. According to a brochure from the American distributor
	        of Mosquito, Kids Be Gone, the device is not violent and does not hurt.
	        The brochure also suggests that the device may be used to reduce vandalism
	        and theft, and improve quality of life for those &#8220;affected by
	        anti social behavior.&#8221; The effectiveness and popularity of the
	        product led the Wall Street Journal to list it as a &#8220;hot dividend
	        stock.&#8221; </p>
	      <p>Some suggest, however, that the Mosquito should be banned &#8211; they
	        argue that the Mosquito helps perpetrate unfair age discrimination.
	        As reported by TimesOnline.com, &#8220;Sir Albert Aynsley-Green, the
	        Children's Commissioner for England&#8230; has set up a campaign &#8211; called
	        Buzz Off &#8211; that is calling for the Mosquito to be banned on grounds
	        that it infringes the rights of young people.&#8221; He argued that
	        the Mosquito promoted &#8220;fear and hatred&#8221; of young people
	        and caused greater dissention between young and old. Scottish Children&#8217;s
	        Commissioner Kathleen Marshall and other civil liberties organizations
	        also joined the Buzz Off campaign. </p>
	      <p>According to British newspaper columnist, Melanie Phillips of The Daily
	        Mail, however, banning this product would be unconscionable considering
	        the &#8220;random savagery and sadism&#8221; perpetrated by teenagers
	        in recent days. Retail entities, police, and governmental agencies have
	        also argued to continue use of the Mosquito. Columnist Kelly Kazek even
	        (although admittedly offhandedly) recommends parents using the device
	        to keep their children in line in smaller settings. </p>
	      <p>The inventor of the product, Howard Stapleton, has chimed in on the
	        debate, as well. He said hopes that government entities will regulate
	        use of the product so that it is only used for legitimate crime prevention
	        purposes, rather than as a means to shoo away unwanted teens. </p>

	  <p>          <strong>Case 7: Babies Behind Bars</strong></p>
	      <p> &#8220;The only thing that bothers me is I will have to lose her,&#8221; said
	        Ms. Jaramillo. <br>
              <br>
              Jaramillo lives in Santa Martha Acatitla prison with her child.
              In the 1990s, Mexico City determined that young children could
              spend the first six years of their lives in prison with their mothers
              rather than outside the prison with relatives or foster parents.
              As of December, fifty-three children lived at the prison.</p>
	      <p> The city government believes that giving the children&#8217;s biological
	        mothers the option to raise them is more of a benefit to the children
	        than keeping them out of prison with relatives or foster parents. </p>
	      <p> For the inmates, the benefits are clear: time passes more quickly
	        on one&#8217;s sentence when one is attending to a loved one. The children
	        present in the prison brighten up the place and break the monotony of
	        prison life with momentous events like first words, first steps, learning
	        to read, and so on. Having the responsibilities of a parent is also
	        a powerful motive for self-improvement, leading to more productive planning
	        for what one will do after being released.</p>
	      <p> The children receive education, as all children in Mexico City are
	        eligible for public education, as well as checkups from the prison psychologist.
	        They also have the opportunity to significantly bond with their biological
	        mothers, an opportunity they would not have if staying with relatives
	        or foster parents. There have been no reports of violence from inmates
	        towards the children except in isolated cases of abuse by mothers with
	        drug problems. These children were removed from their mothers&#8217; care. </p>
	      <p> However, being raised in a prison can&#8217;t help but have its disadvantages.
	        Prisons are drab, dreary places, and children are kept in this environment
	        for many years. They are allowed to leave for weekends to spend time
	        with relatives, but some women do not have a social support system outside
	        the prison, so some children have nowhere to go. And despite the fact
	        that, as one inmate says, &#8220;[My child] doesn&#8217;t know it is
	        a prison...she thinks it&#8217;s her house,&#8221; the house is a cold,
	        drafty place. Children get sick. The city and state provide no extra
	        support for children living with their mothers in prison, so mothers
	        must pay for everything out of personal funds. If they lack needed funds,
	        the children suffer.</p>
      <p> When children turn six years of age, they are sent to live with relatives
	        or foster parents outside the prison. Children lose daily contact with
	        their mothers and must adjust to a life outside of prison that is very
	        different from the one they have known. Mothers must somehow come to
	        terms with seeing their children only during weekend visits. <br>
              <br>
          <strong>Case 8: Biofuel</strong></p>
	      <p>In his most recent State of the Union address, President Bush called
	        for a five-fold increase in biofuel production over the next 10 years.
	        As oil continues to reach record-high prices, and the political landscape
	        in the Middle East grows more violent, finding a sustainable, cheaper
	        and cleaner alternative to fossil fuels seems imperative. Biofuels have
	        been touted by some as a way to finally end U.S. dependence on foreign
	        oil, and reduce our carbon foot-print. However, this naive optimism
	        about the future of biofuels was recently called into question as rising
	        food prices caused riots across the globe. </p>
	      <p>The production of corn-based ethanol in the U.S., an industry heavily
	        subsidized by taxpayers&#8217; dollars, has caused the global price
	        of corn and other grain commodities to rise. The devastating effect
	        of inflated food prices on the global poor has led experts to question
	        the wisdom of using food for fuel. Professor McKnight from University
	        of Minnesota illustrates this tension clearly when he says, &#8220;Filling
	        the 25-gallon tank of an SUV with pure ethanol requires over 450 pounds
	        of corn &#8211; which contains enough calories to feed one person for
	        a year.&#8221; </p>
	      <p>The environmental benefits of corn-based ethanol have also been called
	        into question. Growing corn requires massive amounts of fuel, pesticides
	        and fertilizers, and causes erosion and nitrate depletion of the soil &#8211; with
	        the nitrates then contaminating coastal waters and decimating sea life &#8211; only
	        to produce a fuel that, compared to gasoline, reduces greenhouse gas
	        emissions by (at most) 26%. Even more worrisome is the fact that as
	        corn becomes a coveted commodity, tropical forests are being clear-cut
	        for its cultivation. </p>
      <p>While the U.S. has focused on corn-based biofuels, the rest of the
	        world has been exploring non-food-based alternatives to oil. Cellulose-based
	        biofuels (e.g., waste sugar cane and switchgrass) seem to be the new
	        energy crop, surpassing corn in environmental benefits. It has been
	        estimated that &#8220;cellulosic ethanol could reduce greenhouse gas
	        emissions up to 87 percent.&#8221; Yet, even if the production of cellulose-based
	        fuels ever becomes commercially viable, it is unclear whether it will
	        be able to satisfy the escalating world demand for fuel. <br>
              <br>
          <strong>Case 9: Immigrants Prohibited from Public Universities</strong></p>
	      <p>Missouri&#8217;s legislature is considering a bill that would prohibit
	        illegal immigrants from enrolling in the state&#8217;s colleges and
	        universities. The bill&#8217;s sponsor, State Representative Jerry Nolte
	        argues, &#8220;We're accountable to the people of this state to spend
	        their tax dollars primarily to educate Missouri students and those lawfully
	        present.&#8221; He further notes that it is illegal under federal law
	        to allow illegal immigrants to enroll in their colleges and universities.
	        He concludes, &#8220;While we are obligated to educate children K-12
	        regardless of legal status, there is no requirement to provide post-secondary
	        education.&#8221; Legislators arguing against the bill say that children
	        of immigrants should not be punished for their parents&#8217; actions,
	        legal or not. </p>
	      <p>States other than Missouri have made accommodations for educating illegal
	        immigrants. According to New York Times Columnist, Joseph Berger, &#8220;Since
	        2001, California, Texas, Illinois, New York, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah,
	        Washington, Kansas and Nebraska have charged illegal immigrants the
	        same in-state tuition as other residents so long as they have graduated
	        from state schools. But three states &#8212; Colorado, Georgia and Arizona &#8212; have
	        explicitly outlawed such benefits.&#8221; </p>
      <p> <br>
        <strong>Case 10: Client Confidentiality</strong></p>
	      <p> Does the vow of client confidentiality extend past the client&#8217;s
	        death? The issue came up dramatically when North Carolina attorney Staples
	        Hughes testified at a hearing for a man who may have been wrongly convicted
	        of murder.</p>
	      <p> Hughes represented Jerry Cashwell, who pled guilty to the 1984 murders
	        of Roland and Lisa Matthews. A second man, Lee Wayne Hunt, was thought
	        to be an accomplice. Hunt was convicted and received a life sentence.
	        Cashwell never publicly commented on Hunt&#8217;s involvement, but soon
	        after Hunt&#8217;s conviction, Cashwell told his lawyer in confidence
	        that he had acted alone. </p>
	      <p> Hughes kept his client&#8217;s secret for 22 years, until Cashwell&#8217;s
	        death. Then Hughes began seeking ways to help free the man whom he believed
	        to be innocent. In 2007, Hughes testified at Hunt&#8217;s hearing for
	        a new trial. The judge knew that Hughes planned to reveal Cashwell&#8217;s
	        secret. The judge cautioned him not to, saying that he would be compelled
	        to report Hughes testimony as an ethics violation. Hughes testified
	        anyway, sharing Cashwell&#8217;s admission that he had acted alone in
	        the killings and that Hunt was not involved. The judge reported Hughes
	        to the state bar for violating client confidentiality and refused to
	        consider Hughes&#8217; testimony in reviewing Cashwell&#8217;s case. </p>
	      <p> The U.S. Supreme Court has held that attorneys have a responsibility
	        to keep confidentiality even after a client has died. The Model Rules
	        of Professional Conduct, the rules promulgated by the American Bar Association
	        to guide lawyers&#8217; behavior, also strongly urge against disclosing
	        information unless certain criteria are met. Some legal experts believe
	        that it is sometimes justifiable to violate confidentiality, even when
	        the client is alive, but only to prevent an innocent person from being
	        executed. In some other cases where a suspect or convicted killer had
	        information regarding unsolved crimes, lay people have argued that attorneys
	        should not keep clients&#8217; secrets at the expense of those hoping
	        to find out the fate of missing loved ones. </p>
	      <p> Eventually, Hughes was cleared of wrongdoing by the state bar and
	        continues to practice law. Despite Hughes&#8217; testimony and questions
	        regarding possible faulty analysis of evidence in the case, as of June,
	        2008, Hunt remains in prison.</p>
			<p></p>
      <p>        <strong>Case 11: Nutraloaf</strong></p>
	      <p> A disciplinary technique in prisons throughout the United States is
	        being challenged in court. At issue is a type of food called &#8220;Nutraloaf&#8221; or &#8220;Meal
	        Loaf,&#8221; which is served to unruly prisoners in lieu of regular
	        prison food. Nutraloaf is made of whole wheat bread, non-dairy cheese,
	        carrots, spinach, raisins, beans, vegetable oil, tomato paste, powdered
	        milk, and dehydrated potato flakes. It is served on a single piece of
	        paper to eliminate the need for dishes or eating utensils that might
	        be used against prison personnel or other prisoners. Everyone involved
	        in this controversy agrees that Nutraloaf constitutes a nutritionally
	        complete, though unappetizing meal.</p>
	      <p> Inmates who are restricted to eating Nutraloaf believe that this constitutes
	        a punishment over and above their sentences. They are suing the Vermont
	        Department of Corrections for feeding Nutraloaf without allowing prisoners
	        due process. By law, prisoners may not be punished without a disciplinary
	        hearing process to justify the punishment. So prisoners are not (currently)
	        asking for Nutraloaf to be banned, but for a hearing before it can be
	        used.</p>
	      <p> In the past, subjecting prisoners to Nutraloaf-like meals has been
	        found to be punishment by a federal court in Michigan. In an older decision,
	        the U.S. Supreme Court found that a meal (called &#8220;grue&#8221;)
	        used in Arkansas prisons could be cruel and unusual punishment if continued
	        for long periods of time. However, the Illinois Court of Appeals found
	        that prisoners were not entitled to a hearing before being put on &#8220;controlled
	        feeding status&#8221;, nor did they find that substituted food constituted
	        cruel or unusual punishment. </p>
      <p> Prison officials insist that Nutraloaf is an effective behavior modification
	        technique rather than punishment. According to Vermont&#8217;s Department
	        of Corrections&#8217; Commissioner, Nutraloaf is given to prisoners
	        who abuse food service privileges by using trays and utensils in assaults.
	        Nutraloaf is also fed to inmates who throw feces or urine. Officials
	        claim that once the behavior is stopped, regular food service options
	        and utensils are restored. Disciplinary hearings are not required before
	        prison staff use behavior modification techniques. <br>
              <br>
          <strong>Case 12: Soldiers Losing Custody While Serving</strong></p>
	      <p>The Servicemembers Civil Rights Relief Act was signed by President
	        Bush to &#8220;help ease the economic and legal burdens on military
	        personnel called to active duty status in Operation Iraqi Freedom.&#8221; To
	        some extent, this Act safeguards members by postponing creditor action
	        while they are serving their country (they cannot be evicted from their
	        homes, and their property cannot be taken from them) and reinstating
	        civilian health benefits upon return. </p>
	      <p>The Act is very beneficial if the only person that needs protection
	        is the service member. However, there are approximately 140,000 single
	        parents serving in the military who need protection for their families
	        in addition to themselves. Single parents in the military have been
	        forced to fight not only for their country, but their families and home
	        life as well.</p>
	      <p>Tanya Towne is a single mother of two, Derrell, 12, and Darren, 4.
	        Tanya divorced Derrell&#8217;s father 8 years ago when Derrell was only
	        4 and was granted primary custody. She has been raising him along with
	        Darren, who is her son from a later marriage that also ended in divorce. </p>
      <p>In 2004, Tanya was deployed with the rest of her National Guard unit
	        to Iraq. During that time, Derrell&#8217;s father was granted temporary
	        custody. Near the end of Tanya&#8217;s deployment, he filed a petition
	        for permanent custody of Derrell. He was eventually granted that petition.
	        Even though Tanya appealed, the appellate judges felt that Tanya&#8217;s
	        second divorce along with her deployment played a part in creating an
	        unstable environment for her son. <br>
              <br>
          <strong>Case 13: Slow Medicine Elderly Care</strong></p>
	      <p>Technological advances make it possible to prolong the life and of
	        individuals who suffer terminal illness and/or are of advanced age.
	        In some instances, these technologies have allowed individuals the opportunity
	        to overcome severe obstacles and continue living a meaningful and enjoyable
	        life. Some patients who reach an advanced age or who are suffering from
	        a terminal disease, however, may not wish to prolong their suffering
	        with unwanted surgeries and treatments. </p>
      <p>In a an article published by The New York Times on May 5, 2008, Jane
	        Gross wrote, &#8220;Grounded in research at the Dartmouth Medical School,
	        slow medicine encourages physicians to put on the brakes when considering
	        care that may have high risks and limited rewards for the elderly, and
	        it educates patients and families how to push back against emergency
	        room trips and hospitalizations designed for those with treatable illnesses,
	        not the inevitable erosion of advanced age.&quot; Slow medicine can
	        keep the elderly and terminally ill out of emergency rooms and hospital
	        beds and offers the advantage of saving costs of unwanted treatments.<br>
              <br>
              Slow medicine practitioners generally will delay treating illnesses,
              which helps give their patients more time to understand the procedures.
              Such time can help prevent a rush into unwanted treatments, but
              opponents to slow medicine argue that this laid back approach can
              endanger the health of patients &#8211; that it is the physician&#8217;s
              role to treat illnesses promptly to ensure optimal results. Under
              such a model, slow medicine might be equated to a lesser form of
              euthanasia. Beyond the physical issues associated with slow medicine,
              opponents argue that it creates a defeated mindset in patients,
              encouraging them not to fight even when they may want to. <br>
              <br>
          <strong>Case 14: Cherokee Freedmen</strong></p>
	      <p> Euro-Americans are not the only group with a history of enslaving
	        and disenfranchising African-Americans. Some Native Americans did so
	        as well and some Native tribes are still struggling with what they owe
	        the descendents of slaves, freed slaves and other African descendents
	        who were living on tribal lands in the mid-1800&#8217;s. Collectively,
	        these people are known as the &#8220;Freedmen.&#8221; </p>
	      <p>Article IX of the Treaty of 1866 between the U.S. government and Cherokee
	        Nation states that, &#8220;all freedmen who have been liberated by voluntary
	        act of their former owners or by law, as well as all free colored persons
	        who were in the country at the commencement of the rebellion, and are
	        now residents therein, or who may return within six months, and their
	        descendants, shall have all the rights of native Cherokees.&#8221; This
	        treaty was created with pressure from the U.S. Federal government. </p>
	      <p>Prior to the Civil War, African-Americans lived on Cherokee lands as
	        slaves or as free Blacks, or as children of bi-racial parents either
	        through rape or consensual relationships. Cherokee slaves were emancipated
	        in 1863. However, the first census to include African citizens of the
	        Cherokee Nation didn&#8217;t occur until 1902. In that census, individuals
	        were categorized as freedmen, intermarried whites, or Indians by blood.
	        Children of Indian-Anglo couples were included as &#8220;Indians by
	        blood.&#8221; Individuals who had a Black parent or grandparent were
	        listed as Freedmen, regardless of Indian parentage, giving them no record
	        of having Indian blood. </p>
	      <p>While some Freedmen remained active in the tribe, others have little
	        or no interest in staying connected to the tribe or its culture. In
	        2007, Cherokee tribal members voted to rescind citizenship rights initially
	        granted to Freedmen. Freedmen are fighting this decision. </p>
	      <p>Some Freedmen claim that Cherokee governmental officials have been
	        working to disenfranchise Freedmen since the Treaty of 1866. According
	        to legal interpretations and amendments to the Cherokee Constitution
	        over the past 150 years, those eligible for enrollment in the Cherokee
	        tribe must have a U.S. government &#8220;Certificate of Indian Blood
	        Card&#8221; (CDIB). With no record of Indian blood, Freedmen descendents
	        cannot successfully petition to be included on the tribal roles. Other
	        Freedmen argue that their rights were guaranteed regardless of Indian
	        Blood. Without tribe enrollment, individuals may not vote on tribal
	        matters or receive benefits provided through the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
	        such as health benefits or financial reparations provided by the U.S.
	        government. Estimates of Freedmen disenfranchised by the CDIB requirement
	        vary from 2,500 to 25,000 people. </p>
      <p> By summer 2008, the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus and the National
	        Congress of Black Women had expressed support for the Freedmen in their
	        attempt to win back their tribal rights. The National Congress of Native
	        Americans had expressed support for the Cherokee Nation&#8217;s choice
	        to limit tribal rights to those who are Indian &#8220;by blood.&#8221; And,
	        U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama had said that he supports the
	        Cherokee Nation&#8217;s right to determine tribal affiliation, but didn&#8217;t
        agree with the decision to exclude Freedmen. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Case 15: Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act</strong></p>
      <p>Newly passed legislation, known as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
	        Act (GINA), prohibits health insurance companies from using genetic
	        information to deny benefits or raise premiums for individual policies.
	        Employers who use genetic information to make decisions about hiring,
	        firing or compensation could be fined as much as $300,000 for each violation. </p>
	      <p>The reason for the Act is in the title: preventing discrimination against
	        individuals who happen to be genetically predisposed to certain diseases;
	        but some argue that this bill prevents employers from serving the public
	        interest. For instance, public safety might be jeopardized if we allow
	        an individual to drive a school bus or conduct a train if they have
	        a latent health condition that poses a direct threat, such as seizures
	        or a heart condition. </p>
	      <p>Additionally, we could potentially reduce the overall cost of insurance
	        by excluding individuals with high risk conditions, and help to better
	        allocate risk and cost. Similar to high risk insurance for drivers with
	        high accident levels, insurers would still be required to offer policies
	        to those with high risk genetic markers, but they would pay for the
	        cost of their ultimate care directly, that cost would not be shared
	        by the overall population. </p>
	      <p>On the other hand, without anti-discriminatory measures such as GINA,
	        some individuals might avoid the benefits that could be reaped from
	        early detection because they fear the potential repercussions from insurers
	        and employers. <br>
