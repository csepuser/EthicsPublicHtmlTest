		  <p><strong>1. Columbus Dispatch Rides Skybus</strong></p>
		  <p>On April 4, 2008, Amy Saunders, a business reporter for the Columbus Dispatch
		    (Ohio), received an unusual assignment. She was to fly from Columbus
		    to Ft. Lauderdale on an 8:00 PM Skybus flight. Another Dispatch reporter
		    had
		    received a tip early that evening that Skybus, a ten-month-old low
		    cost airline based in Columbus, would quit flying at midnight. The tipster
		    required
		    that no announcement of the impending bankruptcy could be made until
		    9:30 PM, after the last flights were in the air. Saunders was instructed
		    to
		    abide by the news embargo and to report on passenger reactions to
		    the announcement once the flight landed in Florida. On landing, Ft. Lauderdale
		    passengers
		    heard the usual &#8216;come back and fly Skybus soon&#8217; speech. When
		    they deplaned, they discovered that the airline would cease operations
		    at midnight and that any return legs of their tickets were useless.
    Saunders interviewed them and published her article on April 5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
		  <p>Dispatch
		    readers later criticized the paper for not telling the Ft. Lauderdale &#8211;bound
  passengers, before their flight, that Skybus would permanently cease operations
  that night. Matt Fisher, in a letter to the editor on April 22, condemned Skybus
  for deceiving passengers. He claims that the Dispatch, whose first function
  should be as a watchdog, &#8220;essentially made a deal with the burglar: &#8216;We
  won't bark until you finish robbing Skybus customers.&#8217;&quot;</p>
		  <p>Dispatch
    Editor Benjamin Marrison justified the paper&#8217;s &#8216;Silence
    on Skybus&#8217; in an April 13, 2008, editorial. He explained that the paper
    must uphold &quot;two fundamental tenets of what we do. We don't violate
    agreements with sources or break news embargoes. We don't interfere with
    the course of
    news except in extreme circumstances, such as when our silence on an impending
    event would put someone in harm's way.&#8221; Marrison explained, &#8220;The
    nature of what we do sometimes means that we have information that we can't
    report until a certain time. Typically, such restrictions involve the release
    of research. Organizations or institutions provide us their findings so that
    we can thoroughly analyze them. That way, we can have stories and explanatory
    graphics ready to go.&#8221;</p>
		  <p>Skybus claimed it embargoed the news so that
      it could tell its 450 employees before they heard it elsewhere, and to
		    avoid distressing airborne passengers. </p>
		  <p><strong>2. Dangerous Ideas</strong></p>
		  <p>The Code of Ethics of the American Library Association recognizes that
		    controlling and disseminating information carries enormous responsibility
		    and that intellectual freedom and freedom of access to information
		    are fundamental to an informed citizenry. Although prisoners, whether US
		    citizens
		    or not, retain some rights, there are reasonable limitations to those
    rights that may include restrictions on fundamental freedoms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
		  <p>Following
		    9/11, fear of terrorism led the federal Bureau of Prisons to restrict
  prisoner access to religious books. To counteract the threat of radical religious
  groups recruiting members, gaining influence, or promoting terrorist ideas
  in US prisons, the federal Bureau of Prisons compiled a list of approximately
  150 &#8220;noncontroversial&#8221; books and 150 multimedia materials (videos,
  audio books, CDs) for each of twenty major religions. The Standardized Chapel
  Library Project required chapel libraries in prisons to purge books that were
  not on the approved list. Enforcement of the policy resulted in both the removal
  of collections of religious writings acquired over decades and a prohibition
  against acquiring newly released unapproved materials. Some collections were
  comprised of thousands of books and other library materials, including thousand-year
  old classics of religious thought. Rather than identifying and removing-as
  has been done in the past-specific religious or secular library resources that
  incited hatred or violence or threatened security, the new policy limited prisoner
  access to a severely restricted number of pre-approved library materials. The
  list was to be updated occasionally, and prisoners could request that specific
  materials be reviewed for inclusion on future revisions of the list.</p>
		  <p>According
    to a September 10, 2007, New York Times article, Bureau of Prisons spokesperson
    Traci Billingsly stated: ''We really wanted consistently available
    information for all religious groups to assure reliable teachings as determined
    by reliable subject experts.'' However, The Bureau of Prisons declined to
		    publish the list of approved titles, although it is available through
		    the Freedom of
    Information Act. The Bureau also declined to release the names of the religious
    experts on staff at the Bureau of Prisons who determined, in consultation
		    with unnamed external religious scholars, which materials were deemed
		    acceptable. Despite concern that the list excluded significant works, included
		    obscure
    and insignificant ones, and was strongly biased toward a particular perspective,
    the only information released about selection guidelines specified that materials
    could not be discriminatory or disparaging, or advocate violence or radicalization.
    These guidelines did not apply to nonreligious library materials. The Bureau
    of Prisons did not provide funds for libraries without the resources to replace
    their purged collections with acceptable materials.</p>
		  <p>The Standardized Chapel
		    Library Project brought together outraged prisoners, conservative
		    advocates of religious freedom, and liberal supporters of civil
    liberties who opposed the restrictions and who challenged the government&#8217;s
    right to determine what religious ideas are permissible.</p>

	    <strong>3. Forbidden Pleasure</strong></p>
		  <p>Kate and Frederick married and had their only child, Sophia, late in life.
		    Frederick died when Sophia was eight. When Sophia was fourteen, Kate,
		    who was in failing health, worried about what would happen to Sophia. Sophia
		    was mentally handicapped. She had never been institutionalized but
		    always
		    lovingly cared for at home. Sophia began staying a couple of nights
		    a week in a group home, in preparation for the future, as no family members
		    were
		    willing to take responsibility for Sophia when Kate could no longer
		    care for her. Although it was difficult at first for Sophia to adjust to
		    being
    away from home, she soon began to enjoy spending time with her housemates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
		  <p>Kate
		    was also concerned about Sophia&#8217;s sexual and reproductive autonomy.
  Sophia loved playing with her dolls and pretending to be a mommy, and said
  she wanted to be a real mommy with a real baby. However, Sophia was not able
  to care for herself and Kate was certain that she would be incapable of raising
  a child. Sophia, an affectionate young woman, had a natural interest in sex.
  Kate was concerned that a pregnancy and termination or birth of a child,
  particularly if Sophia were not allowed to raise the child, would be extremely
  traumatic. Yet, she did not want Sophia to be denied sexual intimacy and pleasure.
  Kate believed that sterilization was in Sophia&#8217;s best interests.</p>
		  <p>Forced
    sterilization has a shameful history in the United States. The 1927 Supreme
    Court decision, Buck v. Bell (274 U.S. 200), upheld the right of states
    to forcibly sterilize individuals determined to be unfit to reproduce. By
		    1930, over half of U. S. states had laws allowing forced sterilization
		    of individuals
    identified as feeble-minded. These victims were in reality often intelligent
    but poor, uneducated, non-English speakers, or a financial burden on the
		    state. One of the most notorious programs was Virginia's Lynchburg
		    Colony for the
    Epileptic and Feebleminded, where over 8000 young people were sterilized
		    between 1927 and 1972. U.S. law and eugenic sterilization programs
		    inspired Hitler's
    social hygiene experiment that began as forced sterilization and ended with
    the Nazi death camps.</p>
		  <p>The United States Supreme Court declared reproduction
		    to be a fundamental human right (Skinner v. Oklahoma 1942), and subsequent
		    law upheld and strengthened
    this ruling. Federal guidelines forbid the use of federal funds for sterilizing
    incompetent or institutionalized women (42 CFR &sect; 441: 201-206). These
    safeguards protect individuals with limited decisional capacity from forced
    sterilization, allowing sterilization only in strictly limited situations,
    usually for medical necessity. Kate understood that these laws were established
    to safeguard against the cruel and arbitrary practices of the past, and protect
    the reproductive rights of mentally challenged women. She recognized that
    sterilization would permanently deprive Sophia of these rights. She also
    believed the laws
    could be every bit as dehumanizing as the practices they prohibited, and
    that denying sterilization deprived Sophia of the right to exercise sexual
    autonomy
    and experience sexual intimacy without the continual threat of grievous emotional
    harm.</p>
		  <p>Dr. Burns was a family practitioner who had cared for Kate for many
      years and for Sophia all her life. On several occasions as Sophia approached
      puberty,
      Kate and Dr. Burns had discussed Kate's concerns about Sophia&#8217;s sexual
      autonomy. Dr. Burns did not believe birth control devices or pills were
      appropriate for Sophia. She and Kate agreed that Sophia was not able to
      take responsibility
      for her own protection or for the consequences of her sexual actions. They
      were certain that Sophia was unlikely to be as closely supervised in the
      future as she had been while living at home.</p>
		  <p>Dr. Burns understood Kate&#8217;s
        reasons for requesting that Sophia be sterilized, but was ambivalent
		    about supporting her request. Sterilization would be permanent
        and would forever deprive Sophia of the right to reproduce. Dr. Burns
		    did not believe that Sophia could give legitimate informed consent, either
        to agree
        to or refuse sterilization: as Sophia could not envision consequences,
        she was unable to understand and weigh the risks and benefits of various
        alternatives.</p>
		  <p>On the other hand, Dr. Burns believed that nobody was as
		    capable of making
        decisions on Sophia&#8217;s behalf as Kate. Having tended Sophia all
        her life, Dr. Burns knew that Sophia was not capable of caring for a
        child. Further,
        she knew that according to the National Resource Center on Child Sexual
        Abuse, Sophia was up to ten times more likely to be sexually abused than
        a child who
        was not mentally challenged, and that Chamberlain et al. in Pediatrics
        (73:445-450, 1984) reported that 50% of mentally challenged female adolescents
        have had
        sexual intercourse. Dr. Burns was absolutely convinced that Kate was
        motivated only by what she believed was in Sophia&#8217;s best interest
        and would contribute to the best possible quality of Sophia&#8217;s life.</p>

		    Clinic patients was quickly oversubscribed, quelling fears that patients
    would worry about the security of their records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
		  <p>Google Health users
		    will create their own electronic medical record online, with the
		    capability to enter and manage health information and access it online
  from anywhere. This portable medical record will be accessible regardless of
  doctor, moves, insurance changes, etc. The record can be set to send reminders
  to refill prescriptions and schedule return medical visits. Permission from
  the patient is required to access the patient's record; however, there are
  important exceptions noted in the Google Health Terms of Service and Sharing
  Authorization to which users must agree when they sign on for the service.
  Google Health is free to users.</p>
		  <p>Experts have long touted electronic medical
		    records as a way to overcome the lack of coordination among health
		    care providers. In addition, electronic records
  provide patients and providers with search capability linking information in
  the patient's records with information about health care alternatives, thereby
  giving patients more control over their health care choices. Access is available
  to patients, and to providers with patient consent.</p>
		  <p>Google Health allows the
		    patient to determine what information is shared with medical providers
		    and pharmacies. Currently it does not sell advertisements.
  A variety of health care institutions, pharmacies, and organizations have non-exclusive
  partnerships with Google, integrating their technologies to allow information
  to flow back and forth.</p>
		  <p>The fear of a loss of privacy tempers excitement about
		    a Google-mediated record. Google vows that patients have complete
		    control over their records. Patients
  decide who may see their records, and they have the option to delete their
  records completely. The Google Health Privacy Policy (available at its website)
  promises &#8220;Google will not sell, rent, or share your information (identified
  or de-identified) without your explicit consent, except in the limited situations
  described in the Google Privacy Policy, such as when Google believes it is
  required to do so by law.&quot; Critics point out that if medical records are
  not protected, others might use the information to harm the patient: employers
  to deny jobs, insurers to deny health coverage, financial institutions to deny,
  universities to deny admission, and so forth.</p>
		  <p>Fear of commercial exploitation
    also raises concerns, especially since Google Health skirts the issue on
		    its FAQ's page about how it will make money on this
    free-to-consumer product. A program patent has been filed on behalf of Google
    Health allowing pharmaceutical, medical device, and service advertisements
    related to the patient&#8217;s record to pop up when either the patient or
    a provider (permitted by the patient) views the medical record, much as ads
    related to email content show up on pages of Gmail. Visibility is a key factor
    in the influence of information on decisions and behaviors. The positioning
    of information is not an accident, and it is likely that the assignment of
    premium web space will be determined not by the medical relevance of information,
    but by commercial interests. The patented program would allow this advertising
    feature to be disabled by the patient, but in the patent application, Google
    Health points out that insurance companies might raise premiums if people
    did this. The power of industry-supplied information from drug representatives
    to physicians has long been criticized. The broader influence of such information
    targeted at both the provider and the patient is hard to overestimate.</p>
		  <p>Google
      Health's privacy policy (to which users must agree) includes the following
      statement:<br>
      When you provide your information through Google Health, you give Google
      a license to use and distribute it in connection with Google Health and
      other Google services. However, Google may only use health information
      you provide
      as permitted by the Google Health Privacy Policy, your Sharing Authorization,
      and applicable law. Google is not a &quot;covered entity&quot; under the
      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations
      promulgated
      thereunder (&quot;HIPAA&quot;). As a result, HIPAA does not apply to the
      transmission of health information by Google to any third party.</p>
		  <p>When the
        user opts in to having information shared, Google says this:<br>
        We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies
        or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing

        based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any
        other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
		  <p>Elsewhere in
          the Privacy Policy, Google specifies the following:<br>
          If Google becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of
          sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal

	    <strong>5. Halliburton</strong></p>
		  <p>Halliburton Company provides products and services for the oil and gas
		    industry. It operates in at least seventy countries around the world.
		    It has become the center of much negative media attention for a variety
		    of
    reasons in the last few years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
		  <p>Stockholder meetings of publicly held
		    companies, such as Halliburton, are open to all owners of the stock
		    on a first-come-first-served basis. The annual meetings
  involve the election of officers and usually a number of proposals that require
  the approval of a majority of stockholders. Each share of stock counts as one
  vote, so all stockholders have the right to &quot;vote their shares.&quot; Most
  stockholders are unable to attend these meetings in person, so companies mail
  the proxy statement together with a ballot for all items to be voted at the
  meeting. The statement itself contains numerous reports and other important
  information relevant to the agenda. Sometimes management proposes items for
  voting, and sometimes one or more stockholders propose items. In the case of
  stockholder-initiated proposals, the proxy statement contains a statement by
  the proposer and a statement and recommendation by the Board of Directors.
  The management will vote any shares not voted on by the stockholders. On April
  7, 2008, Halliburton sent a proxy statement to all its shareholders announcing
  its annual stockholder meeting scheduled for May 21, 2008, at 9:00 a.m., in
  Houston Texas. </p>
		  <p>At the 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Halliburton Company,
    item four was a stockholder proposal &quot;To Develop and Adopt a Human Rights
    Policy.&quot; The
    Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary were beneficial owners of 100
    shares of Halliburton common stock. Their proposed resolution stated, &quot;Shareholders
    request management to review its policies related to human rights to assess
    areas where the company needs to adopt and implement additional policies
    and to report its findings, omitting proprietary information and prepared
    at reasonable
    expense, by December 2008.&quot; Because Halliburton has operations in 70
    countries, the Sisters stated that the company was vulnerable to a tarnished
    reputation,
    especially when operating in countries where there was &quot;civil conflict,
    weak rule of law, endemic corruption, poor labor and environmental standards.&quot; They
    claimed that Halliburton's existing Code of Business Conduct &quot;did not
    address major corporate responsibility issues, such as, human rights.&quot; They
    noted that KBR, a former subsidiary of Halliburton, &quot;has been linked
    to trafficking-related concerns, including substandard living conditions,
    extremely
    low wages and confiscating employee passports.&quot; Accordingly, the Sisters
    recommended that Halliburton &quot;base its human rights policies on the
    Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization&#8217;s
    Core Labor Standards, and the United Nations Norms on the Responsibilities
    of Transnational
    Corporations and Other Business Enterprises with Regard to Human Rights.&quot; They
    also recommended that the report include (1) an assessment of the risk of
    human rights abuses in the countries where they operate, (2) a statement
    of the current
    system for verifying that their suppliers and contractors are in compliance
    with their human rights policies, and (3) a statement of strategy for engagement
    with all stakeholders. They claimed that, &quot;Worldwide, 99 companies have
    adopted explicit human rights policies addressing a company&#8217;s responsibility
    to the communities and societies where they operate.&quot;</p>
		  <p>Halliburton's Board
      of Directors recommended a vote against this proposal. They pointed out
		    that they had at that time and had continually been addressing
      many human rights issues such as &quot;employment practices, nondiscrimination
      in employment, health and safety, and security of employees and company
      facilities.&quot; They
      pointed to Halliburton's existing Code of Business Conduct and to its employee
      policies and guidelines, saying these documents &quot;substantially incorporate
      laws and ethical principles including those pertaining to freedom of association,
      non-discrimination, privacy, collective bargaining, immigration and wages
      and hours. In some instances, our policies provide protections beyond what
      is required
      by law.&quot; The Board's comments about the proposal included a list of
      policies that covered many issues such as equal employment; internal accounting
      controls;
      antitrust and competition; harassment; health, safety, and the environment;
      and sensitive transactions. In partial elaboration of this last policy,
      they said, &quot;Our employees are strictly prohibited from paying any
      bribe, kickback or other similar unlawful payment to, or otherwise entering
      into
      a sensitive
      transaction with, any public official, political party or official, candidate
      for public office or other individual, in any country, to secure any contract,
      concession or other favorable treatment.&quot; In addition to these policies,
      they pointed to a corporate policy (3-1573), on Minimum Employment Age
      Requirement, which, they said, &quot;Establishes that we will not employ
      anyone, in any capacity, who is under the age of 18 years, except where
      this minimum employment
      age requirement is superseded by local law. Where local law supersedes
      our policy, we will not assign employees under the age of 18 to dangerous
      or
      hazardous occupations.&quot; The Board of Directors felt that, given these
      existing policies, no explicit policy on human rights was necessary.</p>
		  <p>At
        the May 21 meeting, the stockholders voted against all stockholder-initiated
        proposals, including that of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin
        Mary. </p>

	    <strong>6. How Long Is Forever?</strong></p>
		  <p>Residential development threatens thousands of scenic ranches in the least
		    populated state of Wyoming. Paul Lowham owned a 1,000-acre ranch
		    in Johnson County, a county of 7075 residents in the shadow of the Big
		    Horn Mountains.
		    He grew alfalfa and millet and irrigated with water from the Powder
    River.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
		  <p>According to National Public Radio's David Baron (March 11, 2008),
		    in 1993, the Lowham family placed a conservation easement on their
		    property and donated
  the easement to Johnson County. The easement granted the County the right to
  restrict the property to agriculture use and prohibit its subdivision. These
  restrictions bound all future landowners in perpetuity. The County became responsible
  for monitoring the use of the property and, if necessary, enforcing the terms
  of the easement. In consideration for the donation, the Lowhams received a
  federal income tax deduction of $1 million, a figure that represents the amount
  by which the easement reduced the value of the property in prohibiting its
  use for residential development.</p>
		  <p>Six years later, Paul Lowham sold his ranch
		    to Linda and Fred Dowd. The Dowds were farmers, not speculators,
		    so the development restrictions were of no concern
  to them -until the energy company that owned the mineral rights to their land
  began drilling for natural gas. Soon, the Dowds' ranch was littered with fenced
  wells and the infrastructure required to make the wells profitable. The company
  laid pipelines and cut roads across the property. The degradation caused weeds
  to spread throughout the hay meadow.</p>
		  <p>The Dowds petitioned the Johnson County
		    Commission to abandon the conservation easement on their land. They
		    claimed that the fragmentation and contamination
  of their land compromised its viability for agriculture: without the ability
  to farm, their property was essentially worthless. They pleaded that the drilling
  activity effectively made the conservation easement meaningless, because the
  impact of the drilling on the ranch was no different than if it were to be
  developed for residential use&#8211;exactly what the Lowhams didn't want. In
  2002, the County Commission agreed with the Dowds and voted unanimously not
  to sell the easement to the Dowds, but simply to abandon it.<br>
  Now, the Dowds say that they are sorry they ever bought the property. They
  accumulated nearly $50,000 in litigation expenses and claimed they were demonized
  by the residents of Johnson County. The Dowds put part of the ranch up for
  sale at an asking price $1.2 million. The ranch, for now, remains intact and
  the Dowds continue to farm it.</p>

	    <strong>7. Killer Robots</strong></p>
		  <p>The military is moving toward automated killing machines. The reasons
		    for this move are numerous. Most obviously, any dangerous mission
		    that could be carried out by an automated killing machine would reduce
		    the risk
		    to US soldiers. The so-called fog of war leads to poor decisions
		    on the part of human soldiers. Fear, anger, resentment, exhaustion, and
		    countless
		    other physical and psychological factors may lead soldiers to make

		  <p>One nagging concern, however, is the possibility
		    that one of these machines may be captured and turned into a device
		    of terrorism. Before active deployment,
  reasonable failsafe mechanisms must be in place. Here is a not-so-distant future
  scenario.</p>
		  <p>At the top level, a committee of military and civilian leaders agreed
		    that the best defense against capture would be to design robots that
		    would self-destruct
  in the event that they are disabled in a combat situation. Self-destruction
  would carry its own costs, as the robot could harm or kill US military personnel
  should it fall in combat near human soldiers. So, the instruction to self-destruct
  would not take effect if it recognized the near presence of friendly combatants.
  Details were left to the programmers. Military advisers recommended a delayed
  detonation strategy. They suggested that rather than immediately self-destruct,
  the disabled robot should be programmed to &quot;play dead&quot; until approached
  by enemy combatants, and only then explode with much damage to any nearby humans.
  In a close vote, the committee accepted the military recommendation. Details,
  again, would be left to the programmers.</p>
		  <p>During the analysis phase of development,
    the programmers isolated a number of perceptual cues that would allow the
		    robot, even when severely damaged,
    to effectively distinguish between US soldiers, enemy combatants, and all
		    others. The sequence leading to delayed detonation would only activate
		    in the presence
    of enemy combatants. They also established a set of conditions that would
		    determine if the robot had suffered damage in combat or as a result
		    of an ambush. Self-detonation
    could only occur after combat or after an ambush. </p>
		  <p>The programmers did a thorough
		    job of analysis lest an error in their AI (artificial intelligence)
		    be responsible for the death of US soldiers or
    of innocent civilians.
    Nevertheless, the programmers were not soldiers themselves, and had never
    seen field combat at close range. Therefore, their analysis was based on
    imagination
    and interviews with combat soldiers. While they took great care in the analysis
    stage, they found themselves running behind schedule at the testing stage.
    Their managers began applying more and more pressure on them to meet the
    delivery deadline, and so the last line of test and bug fixes was rushed.</p>
		  <p>The
		    robots proved highly effective in battle. After cautious and limited
		    deployments, careful analysis of results, and subsequent adjustments
		    to the
    AI, killer robots
    became less of a novelty to be treated warily, and more of an accepted tool
    for clearing out enemy nests embedded in urban settings. While there were
    occasional incidents of friendly fire or of minor collateral damage, the
    overall results
    were a clear improvement over similar errors in human judgment.</p>
		  <p>On March 12,
		    2015, Commander Ralph Calley sent his robot-assisted squad to clear
		    out a nest of insurgents embedded in a neighborhood. The troops walked
    into an ambush. All the human soldiers were killed and the robot was severely
    damaged. All but two of the insurgents were also killed, and those two were
    injured and fell unconscious nearby. As programmed, the robot fell to the
    ground and lapsed into the state its programmers had termed &quot;lethal
    hibernation.&quot; Within
    an hour, a crowd of curious civilians and children gathered around the still
    scene. The resulting massacre claimed the lives of one hundred and thirty
    eight innocent people.</p>

		    <strong>8. Low Cost Illegal Workers</strong></p>
		  <p>Many people would agree that comprehensive immigration reform is needed
		    in the US to solve issues of border enforcement, guest-worker status,
		    and pathways to legal residency and citizenship for an estimated 12-million
    undocumented immigrants. Not everyone agrees on a solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
		  <p>Sen. Dianne
		    Feinstein (D-California) has been a consistent supporter of immigration
  reform, especially in the form of guest-worker status. Sensing time running
  out for the Congressional session and for farmers approaching planting and
  harvest, she and Larry Craig (R-Idaho) sponsored the &#8220;Ag-Jobs amendment&#8221; intended
  for attachment to a giant Iraq spending bill (HR 2642). The amendment ultimately
  did not get attached to the Iraq bill, but illustrates the compelling issues
  inherent in immigration reform. Specifically this amendment would have given
  temporary legal status to 1.3 million undocumented farm workers over the next
  five years, without promise of citizenship or permanent residency. Workers
  applying for the program would have had to prove they had worked on U.S. farms
  for at least 150 days or 863 hours, or had earned at least $17,000 during the
  last four years. They would have had to remain working in agriculture for the
  next five years, when the program would expire. Without the amendment, Feinstein
  warned Congress that the U.S. would lose $5-9 billion to foreign competition,
  tens of thousands of farms would shut down and 80,000 jobs would move to Mexico.</p>
		  <p>The
    San Francisco Chronicle (May 16, 2008) reported Feinstein saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s
    an emergency. If you can't get people to prune, to plant, to pick, to pack,
    you can't run a farm.&quot; Western Growers, representing California farmers,
    and the United Farm Workers of America backed Feinstein&#8217;s bill. Increased
    pressure at the border and raids at work sites have diminished the flow of
    Mexican workers to California and a viable guest worker program does not exist.
    President of Western Growers, Tom Nassif, pointed out that large growers are
    moving their enterprises to Mexico because they cannot find enough workers
    in the US. Nassif notes that once growing operations move to Mexico they are
    unlikely to return to California. An impending Department of Homeland Security
    rule requiring employers to match workers with a valid Social Security number
    further threatens labor supply. United Farm Workers President Arturo Rodriguez
    supported Feinstein&#8217;s bill as a &quot;critical but temporary fix to a
    much larger problem&quot; according to the San Francisco Chronicle.<br>
    New York Times journalist Joshua Brustein reported similar labor shortages
    in western New York state (May 27, 2008). He interviewed Jim Bittner who
    had just cut down healthy, bearing sweet cherry and peach trees for want
    of labor
    to prune and harvest. He will grow other fruits that can be harvested by
    machine. Dairy farmers who can afford to are installing very expensive robotic
    milking
    machines to replace humans, and other farmers are switching to crops that
    do not require the careful handling by human pickers. Brustein also quotes
    Ben
    Frega, vice president of Great Lakes Kraut, who said, &quot;It's been more
    difficult to secure our crops than any year I can remember.&quot; Brustein
    cites agricultural industry experts who expect continued moves away from labor-intensive
    crops if immigration policies are not resolved. As many as 800 farms are &quot;highly
    vulnerable to going out of business or forced to severely cut back their farm
    operations,&quot; according to the Farm Credit Association of New York.</p>
		  <p>An article
    by Jennifer Moreno in the Houston Chronicle (May 25, 2008) reports findings
    of a study that &#8220;if the 8.1 million undocumented immigrants
    who cut lawns, bus tables and perform other jobs disappeared overnight, the
    nation's economy would lose nearly $1.8 trillion in annual spending.&#8221; Moreno
    also cites Charles Foster, immigration attorney and chair of Americans for
    Immigration Reform, citing the need employers have to hire immigrants legally.
    Foster claims eliminating undocumented immigrant workers would seriously
    harm the US economy.</p>
		  <p>Groups such as the Colorado Employers for Immigration
      Reform and the Arizona
      Employers for Immigration Reform have formed unusual political alliances
      with humanitarian and religious groups, immigrants' rights groups and labor
      unions
      to address the issue of immigration reform. They are looking for sensible
      solutions that solve the problems of illegal immigration while allowing
		    the use of foreign
      workers.</p>
		  <p>The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), however,
		    believes that undocumented workers take jobs from Americans and drive
		    wages down.
      Moreno
      quotes Ira Mehlman, FAIR media director: 'In many cases, there were people
      doing the jobs before the illegal immigrants showed up. In many cases,
      these are just subsidized jobs because the employer can get away with whatever
      he's paying. A lot of these studies begin with the presumption that the
      jobs
      would
      not be getting done if not for the illegal immigrants,&#8221; Moreno cites
      a 2007 FAIR study showing that &#8220;education, health care and incarceration
      of undocumented immigrants in six states, including Texas, exceeds $27
      billion annually.&#8221;</p>
		  <p>Critics question whether it is fair to give US
        farmers an advantage over foreign farmers, especially when employees
		    may be exploited outside US
        labor laws.
        Critics who oppose amnesty for illegal immigrants called the &#8216;AgJobs&#8217; amendment
        a backdoor path to amnesty. Comprehensive reform overtly leading to citizenship
        for the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants failed to pass Congress
        in 2007.</p>

		    <strong>9. Military Anthropologists</strong></p>
		  <p>Winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people proved to be more of
		    a challenge than the U.S. military command had anticipated. In 2003,
		    the military turned to social scientists for help in understanding the
		    complexities
		    of interwoven tribal values and of local socio-economic realities
		    of Iraqi culture. For instance, when one consultant realized that men from
		    a particular
		    village joined the insurgency for the wages the men could give their
		    impoverished widowed mothers, the military began a job-training program
		    for village
		    widows. Similar responses to local issues reduced the incidence of
		    armed conflict by identifying and addressing the underlying social and
		    economic
		    problems that fed the insurgency. As a result of these successes,
		    the Department of Defense established the Human Terrain System, which embedded
		    social
		    scientists in military units in Iraq and Afghanistan and laid the
    foundation for the Minerva Consortia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
		  <p>The Minerva Consortia were created
		      to strengthen ties between the military
    and academe, with the Pentagon supporting and utilizing social science research.
    Priorities were established and included strengthening national security,
		    addressing terrorism, understanding religious and ideological perspectives,
		    assessing
    Chinese foreign military capacity and technological advances, and exploiting
    new disciplines that might emerge from current conflicts (as game theory
		    emerged from Cold War technologies). </p>
		  <p>In an April 2008 speech to the Association of
    American Universities, Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense and former of Texas
    A &amp; M University president,
    assured university officials that &#8220;&#8230;the key principle of all components
    of the Minerva Consortia will be complete openness and rigid adherence to academic
    freedom and integrity. There will be no room for 'sensitive but unclassified',
    or other such restrictions in this project. We are interested in furthering
    our knowledge of these issues and in soliciting diverse points of view &#8211; regardless
    of whether those views are critical of the Department&#8217;s efforts. Too
    many mistakes have been made over the years because our government and military
    did not understand &#8211; or even seek to understand&#8211;the countries or
    cultures we were dealing with.&quot;</p>
		  <p>Social scientists were divided in their
    support of the Minerva Consortia. Proponents welcomed a closer collaboration
    between universities and the military. They
    applauded the Pentagon's commitment to understand diverse perspectives and
    values, claiming this had already helped reduce military conflicts. Establishing
    democracy and improving local governance in villages where armed conflict
		    had occurred improved quality of life and safety in these communities
		    by treating
    the disease rather than attacking the symptoms. </p>
		  <p>Opponents argued that academic
		    and military values were so fundamentally different that this collaboration
		    was faced with an inherent and irresolvable
    conflict
    between, on the one hand, the university&#8217;s commitment to open discourse
    and continual challenging of ideas and, on the other hand, the military&#8217;s
    strict hierarchy and unquestioned discipline. Opponents expressed fears that
    the military would exert undue influence on research programs and priorities;
    that researchers working in military zones could be perceived as spies, endangering
    themselves and future social scientists working on strictly academic research;
    and that military objectives violated professional ethics in the social sciences.</p>
		  <p>The
      American Anthropological Association, the world&#8217;s largest professional
      anthropological organization with over 11,000 members, was among the most
      vocal critics of the Human Terrain System. The association affirmed the obligation
      of anthropologists to work with the government to enhance appreciation of
      differences
      of culture and value, and to help shape and implement policy. The organization&#8217;s
      executive board, however, denounced the involvement of anthropologists in
      the Human Terrain System as a violation of the organization&#8217;s Code
      of Ethics. &#8220;In
      both proposing and carrying out research, anthropological researchers must
      be open about the purpose(s), potential impacts, and source(s) of support
      for research projects&quot; (Section III). It continues, &#8220;Anthropological
      researchers must do everything in their power to ensure that their research
      does not harm the safety, dignity, or privacy of the people with whom they
      work, conduct research, or perform other professional activities&quot; (Section
      IIIA2). Additional concerns involved violations of the code&#8217;s requirement
      to obtain informed consent and identify the impact the study may have on
      subjects (IIIA4, 3), avoid exploiting subjects (IIIA6), maintain the integrity
      and dignity
      of the profession (IIIB2), and ensure that knowledge gained by research is
      used responsibly and not misused for social or political reasons (IIIC1).</p>

		  <p><strong>11. Pedophile Housing</strong></p>
		  <p>Before 1994, few states had laws that even defined &#8216;sex-offender&#8217;,
		    much less laws that regulated convicted sex offenders' movements
		    and required their registration with local law enforcement. This state
		    of affairs changed
		    with passage of the Federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
		    Act of 1994, which required each state to implement a sex-offender registration
		    program or risk forfeiture of federal grants for law enforcement.
		    The 1994
		    Act was amended in 1996 to oblige states to establish community notification

		    recently, over one-half of the U.S. states proactively passed legislation
  to restrict the locations where sex-offenders may reside. These laws commonly
  restrict sex-offenders from living, and sometimes from working, within a given
  distance (ranging from 500 to 2,000 feet) of places where children gather:
  parks, schools, school bus stops, day care facilities, community centers, and
  churches. </p>
		  <p>Sex-offender laws enjoy widespread support in many quarters. From
		    the beginning, only civil libertarians seem to have challenged some
		    of these laws, usually
  on constitutional grounds. For example, laws that require some sex-offenders
  to remain in prison after their sentences have been completed have been challenged
  on due process grounds. Also, from a constitutional perspective, draconian
  public notification requirements seem to place convicted sex-offenders who
  have paid their debt to society in double jeopardy.</p>
		  <p>On the other hand, sex-offender
		    residency restrictions have lost support in recent years from constituencies
		    that traditionally endorsed them. The most
  notable, perhaps, is the Iowa County Attorneys Association (ICAA), an organization
  of county prosecutors, which issued its Statement on Sex Offender Residency
  Restrictions in Iowa explaining that sex-offender residency restrictions do &#8220;not
  provide the protection that was originally intended and that the cost of [enforcement]&#8230;and
  the unintended effects on families of offenders warrant replacing the restriction[s]
  with more effective protective measure[s].&#8221; Among other things, the document
  contends that residency restrictions force offenders into homelessness and
  otherwise cause them to provide false or no information to state sex-offender
  registries. According to the Statement, the negative consequences of the lifetime
  residency restrictions also have caused a reduction in the number of confessions
  made by offenders in cases where defendants usually confess&#8230;.&quot;</p>
		  <p><strong>12. Polygamy</strong></p>
		  <p>With the victory of gay marriage advocates in Massachusetts, and now California,
		    it seems one of the next great frontiers of social change is polygamy.
		    To use the oft cited quote of Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, &#8220;And
    now, polygamy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      &#8221; (17 Mar 2006).</p>
		  <p>In Reynolds v. U.S., the Supreme Court
		    held that federal legislation banning polygamy was constitutional
		    and did not violate the First Amendment right to
  free exercise of religion. In recent years, the Utah Supreme Court has issued
  several opinions regarding the application of the State bigamy statute to criminalize
  the religiously motivated practice of plural marriage. Without exception, the
  courts upheld the constitutionality of laws banning polygamy.</p>
		  <p>According to ACLU
		    of Utah Legal Director Stephen Clark, &quot;Living arrangements
  are really the most intimate kinds of decisions people make.&#8221; He contends
  that Utah's polygamists are just like gays and lesbians who &#8220;&#8230;want
  the right to live their lives, and not live in fear because of whom they love&#8221; (ACLU
  Release, 16 Jul 1999).</p>
		  <p>The protection of sexual privacy received a boost in
    2003 when the U.S. Supreme Court in Texas v. Lawrence struck down the long-standing
    sodomy law in Texas
    that criminalized homosexual sex. The bigamy statute in Utah, argue many,
		    is like the sodomy statutes&#8211;it is anachronistic and rides roughshod
		    over what the Supreme Court identifies as important fundamental privacy
    rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
		  <p>The arguments against legalized polygamy seem ambiguous in contrast
		    or, as
    Jonathan Rauch puts it in &quot;One Man, Many Wives, Big Problems,&quot; &#8220;The
    broad public opposes polygamy, but is unsure why.&#8221; Most commonly, detractors
    of polygamy, even the most temperate, rely on anecdotal evidence to suggest
    that polygamous marriages foster and condone statutory rape, lead to trafficking
    in underage girls, and increase instances of incest. Also circumstantially,
    but perhaps as convincingly, Jonathan Rauch points to research that shows
    no polygamous societies have ever been true democracies and crime rates tend
    to
    be higher in them (reasononline, 2006).</p>

		    <strong>13. Shock Marketing</strong></p>
		  <p>Schaqra Enterprises, a once failing clothier, had recently become profitable.
		    The management attributed the company's success to its new marketing
		    department. These &quot;Young Turks,&quot; an energetic and aggressive
		    group of recent grads, had convinced the management to take a gamble on
		    shock advertising.
		    The theory was simple: they needed to get everyone talking about
		    their company&#8211;even if the talk was critical or outraged. Public outrage
		    would generate protests, letters to editors, and news coverage, all
		    of which was free publicity. But if enough people knew about them, it didn't
		    matter how many people hated them. All it took was a small percentage
		    of
		    people interested enough to try out their products. The high quality
    of their products would then speak for itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
		  <p>Flush with the company's
		    sudden profitability, Schaqra's management sought
  to expand the small, overworked marketing team by interviewing and hiring a
  new marketing MBA. Each interviewee learned that the new hire would be assigned
  to one of three ongoing projects.</p>
		  <p>The first project was a line of dress shirts,
		    targeted at young men. The ads in this campaign featured tense dialogues
		    between men and women. Their attitudes
  and postures ranged from sultry to ominous, their conversation vague or rambling.
  Their entire figures were never quite visible, the image being cropped so their
  torsos filled the screen. The men were never wearing Schaqra clothes. At the
  end of the ad, a male voice delivered the tag line: &quot;Looking good sure
  beats rape.&quot;</p>
		  <p>The second project was a line of simple, feminine dresses,
    targeted at women in their twenties. These ads featured a painfully sharp
		    image of a somewhat
    grimy, out-of-shape man slouched on a chair in the foreground and a slender
    woman out of focus in the background. Both figures faced toward the camera,
    but the image was cropped so neither person's head was visible. As the woman
    talked to the man, he distractedly agreed. She clearly wanted him to get
		    up from his armchair and do something. The tag line was, &quot;Wear it
    just for you: he's too stupid to notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      &quot;</p>
		  <p>The third project was a line
		    of business suits, some for men, some for women, and was targeted
		    at yuppies. This campaign had appeared only on billboards
    in urban business areas. Each billboard contained a giant, black-and-white
    photograph of some shocking or unnerving image: the face of a blind beggar,
    a extreme close-up of a pierced male nipple, a cow's eye in a martini glass,
    and so forth. The image was never in any way connected with clothing. The
    company logo was the only indication that this image was meant to be an ad.
    At first,
    the logo had been fairly visible, but as the campaign progressed, the logos
    became smaller and smaller. In fact, no one needed to see the logo to know
    that Schaqra was involved. The campaign was so successful that locals had
    started saying of any outrageous behavior or incident that it was &quot;Schaqring,
    totally Schaqring.&quot; The current set of billboards featured a photograph
    of young boy with eight flippers instead of legs.</p>

		  <p>Fred was a promising computer science major at a prestigious school, so

		    driven home after a party, closed the garage door, and sat in his car without

		    The insurance company refused to pay on his life insurance because
    his policy excluded death from suicide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
		  <p>Sally, Fred's older sister, asked
		    her boyfriend, Hal, if he could gain access
  to whatever information Fred may have left behind. Hal was a computer science
  major and far more familiar with computers than any of Fred's surviving family,
  but was not a &quot;hacker.&quot; Sally, acting as executor, wanted to know
  if there was any sort of evidence that his death may have been accidental.
  But more importantly, they wanted to know, if Fred had indeed killed himself,
  what could have possibly driven him to do it.</p>
		  <p>Hal posed the question anonymously
    to an online community of computer nerds, asking (1) what was the right thing
    to do, and (2) if cracking into Fred's
    accounts was ethical, how would he go about doing it? Specifically, he wanted
    to know how to crack the root password on Fred's Linux laptop, how to get
		    into his Gmail and Hotmail accounts, and how to access a secondary
		    MySpace account
    tagged &quot;private.&quot; He explained the circumstances and emphasized
    that he wouldn't crack into the accounts of anyone who was alive, but wasn't
    sure
    what to think about privacy of a dead person.</p>
		  <p>The original post generated
      nearly 800 replies, almost all of which were serious attempts to answer
		    the numerous questions that Hal raised explicitly
      or implicitly.
      Gradually, a consensus emerged that Fred's accounts were his property and,
      as such, ownership passed to the executor of the estate, such as it was.
      At the request of the executor, Hal would be acting with complete propriety
      if
      he recovered any data from those accounts. For several posts, the conversation
      dealt with how to bypass the passwords of Linux systems and gain access
		    to passwords to other accounts that may be stored in Firefox or other programs.
      Then, one person mentioned, almost in passing, that for the sake of the
		    family,
      Fred should take a moment to &quot;accidentally&quot; delete any porn and
      such that Fred may have collected, just as a matter of common courtesy. Another
      poster added that there was a military tradition of cleaning up the locker
      of a dead companion by taking out any men's magazines, letters to local girlfriends,
      or anything that would make the soldier's family and friends think less of
      him or cause pain to survivors. Another pointed out that there was a problem
      with picking and choosing what to edit--what if there were some nasty things
      that Fred had been involved in that actually led him to commit suicide, or
      worse yet, what if it was something the family had done?</p>

		    <strong>15. Blood Pressure</strong></p>
		  <p>State University&#8217;s commitment to fostering an environment of mutual
		    respect and tolerance, and recognizing and valuing the inherent worth and
		    dignity of every person is articulated in its non-discrimination policy.
		    The policy states:<br>
		    The University prohibits and will not support discrimination or harassment
		    on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry,
		    sex, age, marital status, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity
		    or expression, disability, or status as a disabled veteran or a veteran
		    of the Vietnam War or Gulf Wars by university employees, faculty,
		    students,
		    residents, volunteers, agents, groups, and internal and external
		    organizations that use University facilities. The University will not discriminate
		    or
		    tolerate discrimination in admissions, employment, or access to and
		    treatment in University programs, activities, services, aids, or benefits.
		    This policy
		    specifically excludes, but only to the extent of the law, university
		    relations with the federal government, the military, ROTC, and private
		    employers.</p>
		  <p>The policy statement appears on all University publications,
		    and
		    each University-sponsored organization is required to sign a statement
		    agreeing to abide by the school&#8217;s non-discrimination policy. Now
		    President Portia faces a dilemma that is dividing the University
		    community as individuals and organizations that promote worthy causes appear
		    to be
		    in conflict. </p>
		  <p>Like many communities across the country, the town where State University
		    is located is experiencing a blood shortage. In response to the crisis,
		    the Student Nurses Honor Society, the Student Veterans Association, the
		    Medical Technology Student Association, the Pathology Club, and the Red
		    Cross are organizing a campus blood drive. Other students and faculty,
		    however, are challenging President Portia to uphold the University&#8217;s
		    non-discrimination policy that prohibits activities on campus that arbitrarily
		    discriminate against a particular class of individuals. </p>
		  <p>Five safety checks protect the country&#8217;s blood supply: screening,
		    testing, deferral registries, blood quarantine, and the manufacturing process.
		    Currently, the safety of any donation can be assured after 11 days &#8211; safe
		    from all but human error. Human errors in labeling and using blood before
		    the 11-day testing and treatment processes are completed are responsible
		    for almost all the tainted blood that is used. Despite opposition from
		    local governments, educational institutions, civil rights groups, blood
		    banks, the AMA, and most recently the Red Cross (who reversed its similar
		    policy two years ago), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permanently
		    bans blood donations from men who have had even one male-on-male (MOM)
		    sexual encounter since 1977. Every male donor is asked, &quot;From 1977
		    to the present, have you had sexual contact with another male, even once?&quot; If
		    the answer is yes, the man is prohibited from donating blood &#8211; forever
		    - and this information is stored permanently. The FDA is required to make
		    recommendations based solely on scientific evidence, even to the extent
		    of disregarding ethics and economics to present unbiased, hard scientific
		    evidence. Although the FDA states that the zero tolerance policy for blood
		    from MOM donors is not judgmental with regard to the donor's sexual orientation,
		    it has failed to provide either scientific or ethical justification for
		    permanently deferring MOM donors. Further, it does not impose the same
		    restrictions on either the female partners of MOM donors, who are deferred
		    from donating blood for only 12 months, or on transgendered individuals
		    (who are not acknowledged by the FDA).</p>
		  <p>President Portia discussed with city officials the possibility of holding
		    the drive at city hall, but was informed that the city discontinued blood
		    drives because the practice conflicted the with city&#8217;s non-discrimination
		    policy.</p>
