              <a name="Regional"></a>Regional IEB Rules</h3>
              <p><strong>Rules for School Eligibility</strong></p>
              <p>A school may send unlimited teams to a regional bowl. If it sends multiple
              teams, it must specify which teams are linked and which are not. Linked
              teams are closely connected &#8211; e.g. the same faculty sponsor, preparation
              together in the came class or ethics bowl club, or participation in the
              same intramural ethics bowl, etc. Unlinked teams are those without major
              connections &#8211; e.g. consisting of students from different colleges,
              with significantly different courses of study, within a large university.</p>
              <p>If any of a group of linked teams is eligible for the national bowl, a
              single team may be formed with members of any linked teams in the group
              for the national bowl, but only one space can be earned at the national
              bowl, no matter how well the linked teams perform at the regional bowl.
              If teams are not linked, each team is independently eligible for the national
              bowl, but members may not be switched from one team to another.</p>
              <p><strong>Rule for Student Eligibility</strong></p>
              <p>Members of a school&#8217;s team must be undergraduate students currently
              enrolled at the school. Students who graduate between the regional bowl
              and the national bowl remain eligible for the national bowl. </p>
              <p><strong>Rules for participating in multiple regional bowls:</strong></p>
              <p>A school may take part in more than one regional bowl. However, the school
              must notify the IEB Executive Board prior to ANY of the bowls which one
              it will use as a qualifier for the national bowl.</p>
              <p><br>
                <strong>Number of teams at the National Bowl (2008-09)</strong></p>
              <p>There will be <strong>thirty-two (32)</strong> participating teams.</p>
              <p><br>
                <strong>Qualifying Rules for teams to advance from regional bowls to
                the national bowl:</strong></p>
              </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>There will be thirty-two (32) participating teams in the National
        Ethics Bowl.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>The number of teams each regional bowl sends to the national
                bowl each year will depend on the total number of participating regional
                bowls and
              the size
          of the particular regional bowl</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>The default number of teams sent by
                a regional bowl will be D=32/N where N is the number of regional
            bowls participating, and D is the
                  default number
              of teams sent.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>If a regional bowl has fewer than 10 unlinked teams,
                the default number of teams it will send to the national bowl is
        D-1.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>The remaining spaces will be filled in by the procedure outlined
                      in the appendix.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div> Each regional bowl will therefore have
                a claim on a particular number of spaces, S. Each bowl will fill
            those spaces with
                              the top S teams
                              from its region.
                              Should a team be unable to attend the national bowl,
            its space will go to the next highest ranked team, until all
                              S spaces
        are filled. </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div> Each regional bowl will use scoring rules
                that make it possible to rank teams from top to bottom<br><br>
            <em>Appendix</em>
            <blockquote>
              <div>
                The additional spaces up to 32 are allocated to the regional bowls based on
                          the odds of a team from that regional bowl moving on. The first space is
                          allocated to the regional bowl with the lowest odds, the second space to
                          the regional bowl with the second lowest odds, and so forth. Ties are broken
                          by counting the number of schools involved (the higher the better) then total
                          number of unlinked and linked teams (the higher the better), then by coin
                  toss. </div>
          </blockquote>
          <div><em>Example:</em>   Assume that there are 8 bowls, with the following number
          of unlinked teams in each bowl:</div>
          <blockquote>
            <div>Bowl A 8<br>
              Bowl B 8<br>
              Bowl C 8<br>
              Bowl D 9<br>
              Bowl E 11<br>
              Bowl F 13<br>
              Bowl G 15<br>
              Bowl H 18
              </p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <div>The initial distribution of spaces for each bowl would be:</div>
          <blockquote>
            <div>Bowl A 3<br>
              Bowl B 3<br>
              Bowl C 3<br>
              Bowl D 3<br>
              Bowl E 4<br>
              Bowl F 4<br>
              Bowl G 4<br>
              Bowl H 4
              </p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <div>This would leave 4 open spaces. We calculate the odds of moving on from
              a particular bowl:</div>
          <blockquote>
            <div>Bowl A 3/8=37.5%<br>
              Bowl B 3/8=37.5%<br>
              Bowl C 3/8=37.5%<br>
              Bowl D 3/9= 33%<br>
              Bowl E 4/11=36.3%<br>
              Bowl F 4/13=30%<br>
              Bowl G 4/15=26%<br>
              Bowl H 4/18=22%
              </p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <div>So the four spaces would go to the following bowls:</div>
          <blockquote>
            <div>Bowl H 22%<br>
              Bowl G 26%<br>
              Bowl F 30%<br>
              Bowl D 33%
              </p>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
          <div><br>
          <strong>Dates:</strong></div><br>
          <div>Regional bowls must be held in time for teams to accept an invitation
                          to the national bowl by December 15. Teams must confirm by this date or
          risk losing their space.</div><br>
          <div><strong>Rules variations in regional bowls:</strong></div><br>
          <div>Regional bowls are expected to use the national bowl&#8217;s rules,
            guidelines, and scoring rubric, with the following exceptions:</div><br>
          <ol>
            <li type="a">Regional bowls are <u>not</u> required to conduct a straight elimination
                                      match of the top scoring teams in the three morning
                      matches, as provided for under the national rules. However, regional
                      bowls must
                      adopt scoring
            rules that enable them to rank teams from top to bottom. </li>
            <li type="a">Under certain conditions
                          other alterations will be allowed, such as the following:<br>
               Minor adjustments to timing and other rules are allowed without
                                      prior approval, but require notification to
                   the IEB Executive Board, and, where appropriate,
                                      post-bowl reports about the effects of these
                   adjustments. Pre-approved variations include:<br>
                <ol>
                  <li> initial presentations may run from 7 to 12 minutes.</li>
                          <li> commentary on initial presentations may run from 5 to
                                      8 minutes.</li>
                          <li> ratio of presenting team to opposing team
                        scores may not exceed 5:1.</li>
                          <li>judges&#8217; Q&amp;A need not be restricted to
                            one Q and one follow-up;</li>
                          <li>judges&#8217; Q&amp;A may be expanded
                                    from 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                          <li> response to commentary may be shortened in favor
                                of lengthening the judges&#8217; Q&amp;A
                                    period.</li>
                          <li> rules regarding the number of members of a team that
                                              may speak during any particular part of the round
                                  may be changed
                        without prior consent. </li>
                          <li>regional bowls may allow one minute for initial
                                conferral, and may have any policy they deem appropriate
                                on when teams may use scratch paper, as long as notes
                            are not in from the outside. </li>
                          <li>the winner of a match may be determined by which
                                team received higher scores from the majority of
                            judges rather than the highest points. </li>
              </ol>
                      <p><em>Experiments involving more significant changes require</em> approval from the
                                      IEB Executive Board and require reports about the effects of these changes.
                                      The regional bowls can serve as test beds for useful experimentation, with
                                      successful experiments ultimately being adopted by the national bowl (and
                                      therefore the other regional bowls). However, changes that alter the essential
                                      nature of the event as an academic competition will be turned down by the
                          executive board.

              Teams should wait to use the scratch paper until the case
                              has been announced. Students are permitted to pass
                              notes to one another at any point. At the halfway

                                a question to Team 1. More than one team member may contribute
                                to the commentary, but only one team member
                                          may speak at a time.<br>

          SCORING RULES:</div><br>
          <ol>
            <li> Judges shall evaluate the responses of teams solely in terms of the
                                              following criteria:<br>
              <br>
              Clarity and Intelligibility - Was the presentation clear and systematic? Regardless
                                          of whether or not you agree with the conclusion, did the team give a coherent
                                          argument in a clear and succinct manner? <br>
              <br>
              Avoidance of Ethical Irrelevance: Did the team avoid ethically irrelevant issues?
                                          Or was the team preoccupied with issues that are not ethically relevant or
                                          are of minor ethical relevance to the case?<br>
              <br>
              Identification and Discussion of Central
                                          Ethical Dimensions: Did the team&#8217;s
                                          presentation clearly identify and thoroughly
                                          discuss the central ethical dimensions
                                          of the case? <br>
              <br>
              Deliberative Thoughtfulness: Did the team&#8217;s presentation indicate both
                                          awareness and thoughtful consideration of different viewpoints, including especially
                                          those that would loom large in the reasoning of individuals who disagree with
                                          the team&#8217;s position?<br>
            </li>
            <li> The judges will score each team as follows:<br>
              <br>
              <strong>0-40 for a team's answer to the Moderator's question (40 best); In
                                          evaluating a team's answer the judges will give the team a score of 0-10 relative
                                          to each of the four evaluation criteria indicated above and total the sum.<br>
              <br>
              0-10 for the opposing team's commentary (10 best);<br>
              <br>
              0-10 for the response to the opposing team&#8217;s commentary,
                              and for the response to the judges questions, by the
                  team that answered the Moderator's
                                          question (10 best).<br>
              <br>
              Both in evaluating a team's commentary, and the other team's response to the
                                          commentary, the judges will take into account the four evaluation criteria
                                          indicated above, but give the teams an overall score, rather than a separate
                point score relative to each of the criteria.</strong><br>

            <li> The top eight teams in the competition will be determined in

              <div><u>Morning Competition: </u></div>
                        <blockquote>
                          <div><strong>Teams will be ranked based on a) the number

                                  by c)  point differential.
                                  Thus, all teams with three wins will rank ahead
                                  of all teams with
                                  two wins. All teams with two wins will rank ahead
                                  of all teams with
                                                            one win. Within rankings,
                                  a team with more ties ranks above a team with fewer
                                  ties. Finally, for teams with the same number of
                                  wins and ties,
                                      a team with a higher point differential would

                                      total points and subtracting the other team&#8217;s
