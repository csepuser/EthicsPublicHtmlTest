		<h2>1993-1996 Sample Cases </h2>
		<p> <strong>(1)</strong> Bill has been hired as a student engineering assistant for the summer
		  by acme Plastics. His superior is Frank Jones, the plant production engineer,
		  who believes in management by strict chain of command, and whom Bill finds
		  intimidating. Bill very much needs the job to earn tuition fees for the coming
		  year. His duties frequently take him through an assembly line area where
		  he observes the following conditions. Workers on an assembly line glue together
		  several small plastic parts which are then placed on a conveyor belt that
		  carries them through a heating oven where the glue is set. By the end of
		  the day drops of glue have accumulated on the conveyor belt. So, at clean-up
		  time, the workers, using rags and soap tins filled with solvent, which they
		  obtain from a nearby barrel, wipe the belt as it passes by. Bill notices
		  that during this process the oven is not shut off. It occurs to him that
		  under these conditions an explosion could take place in which workers could
		  be hurt seriously. Frank Jones has canceled the normal bimonthly safety meetings
		  until further notice because he considers them a waste of time and an impediment
	  to productivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </p>
	  
	  <p>What is Bill morally required to do in this case? Why? </p>
		<p><strong>Moderator's Answer:</strong> Bill is morally required to voice his
		    concerns to Frank. Engineers have a professional obligation not only
		  to regard the
		      public's safety as paramount, but also, as a corollary, to so view
		    the safety of fellow employees at work. This obligation applies to
		  bill, though
		      still a student, in virtue of working in the capacity of an engineer.
		    Alerting one's immediate superior within an organization to a condition
		  one believes
		      may be hazardous to fellow employees clearly falls within the scope
		    of this obligation. Sometimes acting to fulfill one's professional
		  obligations may involve an element of personal risk in terms of one's personal
		    interests,
		      but in this case, the risks do not seem great, even given Frank's
		    expressed attitude toward safety meetings. <br>
      </p>
		<p><strong>(2)</strong> Professor Bruce I Lazarus of Purdue University's School of Hotel and
		  Institutional Management has for the past several years had students
		  in his hospitality law class keep a &quot;drinking diary&quot; for a one
		  week period. In the diary students record &quot;their drinking behavior patterns
		  and any other observations they may make in relation to alcohol.&quot; Professor
		  Lazarus describes the main purpose of the assignment as to get his
		  students &quot;to
		  learn about themselves and society's attitude toward drinking.&quot; He describes
		  the student response as &quot;overwhelmingly positive.: Professor Lazarus
		  is the only person who reads the diaries, and he allows students who
		  don't want to keep a &quot;drinking diary&quot; to choose an alternative
	  assignment. (Reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Feb.'93) </p>
		<p>Is the &quot;drinking
		  diary&quot; an ethically acceptable assignment? If
	  so, why? If not, why not? </p>
		<p><strong>Moderator's Answer: </strong>Yes: It is very important
		    for students entering the hospitality field to reflect thoroughly
		  both about social attitudes toward
		    alcohol as well as about their own attitudes and behavioral patterns
		    in regard to alcohol use. By not letting anyone else read the diaries,
		  and by giving
		    students the option of doing another assignment Professor Lazarus
		  provides sufficient safeguards for student privacy. <br>
      </p>
		<p><strong>(3)</strong> In the 1970's the United States Supreme Court ruled
		  that the government was not required to fund abortions. Congress, in a hard
		  fought compromise,
		  authorized payment for Medicaid abortions in the case of rape, incest,
		  and danger to the health of the woman. The Department of Health, Education,
		  and
		  Welfare (HEW) had the responsibility of implementing this legislative
		  compromise by drafting regulations to cover the funding of abortions. The
		  Secretary
		  of HEW at that time, Joseph Califano, was a practicing Catholic who
		  personally believed both that abortion is morally wrong except to save the
		  life of the
		  woman, and that as a matter of public policy, elective abortions should
	  not be funded by the government. </p>
		<p>Which of the following courses of actions
		  would have been most appropriate
	  for Secretary Califano in the circumstances? Explain your choice.        
		<blockquote>a) instruct his staff to implement rules and regulations reflecting
		    the intent of Congress to provide Medicaid funding for abortions
		      even in cases other than rape and incest, a congressional decision
	      that Secretary
		    Califano believed to be morally wrong. <br>
	      b) use his powerful position to thwart the intent of Congress; <br>
      c) resign from his position</blockquote>
		(issue posed by Arthur Applebaum in &quot;Democratic Legitimacy and Official
	  Discretion,&quot; Philosophy and Public Affairs Vol. 21 No.3 (1992) pp. 240-73) </p>
		<p><strong>Moderator's Answer: </strong>Secretary Califano was not morally obligated to resign
		  in view of his attitude toward abortion. On the other hand, he also was not
		  obligated morally to remain in office. In choosing to remain, however, Secretary
		  Califano had an obligation as a public official to carry out the law. A public
		  official must do so even if she or he disagrees with the law either on grounds
		  of ethics or policy. It is morally inappropriate for an appointed official,
		  such as the Secretary of HEW, to use his or her position to undermine the
		  legislative decisions of the United State Congress, which reflect the will
		  of the people. <br>
		  (Secretary Califano sought advice about what to do from Father Richard
		  MacCormack, a professor at Georgetown University. Father MacCormack's advice,
		  based upon Catholic moral teachings, coincided with the above analysis. <br>
        </p>
		<p><strong>(4) </strong>Suppose there are two alternative punishments for the
		  same criminal offense, A, six months in prison, and B one year of community
		  service (with
		  no prison term). Imposing punishment A would incapacitate convicted
		  offenders and, thereby, render them incapable of engaging in criminal activity
		  for
		  the duration of the punishment. On the other hand, imposing B would
		  have no such incapacitating effect. </p>
		<p>May predicted dangerousness serve as
		    a morally legitimate basis for
		    imposing a particular penalty upon certain convicted offenders for
		    a given offense? Or, would incapacitated offenders -- e.g. those
		  who receive punishment
		    A in the above example - have any legitimate objection to their punishment
		    if other offenders who committed the same offense, but who are considered
		    predictably non-dangerous, receive a less restrictive punishment
		  -- e.g. punishment B in the above example? In either case, state your
		    reasons. </p>
		<p><strong>Moderator's Answer: </strong>Society may not justifiably base punishment upon
		    predictions of a person's predicted dangerousness. such predictions
		    cannot be made with accuracy. Furthermore, even if they could it
		  would still be
		    wrong to base punishments upon them. This is because punishment on
		    the basis of predicted dangerousness imposes penalties upon a person
		  for what he might
		    do rather than what he actually did. Thus suppose, for example, there
		    are two young drug offenders convicted of the same offense, but one
		  is from a
		    wealthy suburban environment and the other from an impoverished inner
		    city environment. suppose that the latter environment is more strongly
		  correlated with future criminal acts than the former. This difference cannot
		  morally
		    justify imposing a more severe sentence on the offender with an impoverished
		    inner city background. The only approach that is morally justifiable
		    for
		    society to deal with the relationship between a particular environment
		    and criminal behavior is to try to eliminate the factors in that
		  environment that tend to producer crime. <br>
      </p>
		<p><strong>(5)</strong> Jennifer is presenting a persuasive speech in Public Speaking 101 class.
		  She is advocating student action on a matter that has high student interest
		  on campus. You are one of her classmates and are appalled at the inaccuracy
		  of her claims. It is evident to you - but apparently not to the majority
		  of your classmates - that Jennifer has not adequately researched her topic.
		  Unfortunately, she seems to be getting an enthusiastic response from the
		  class anyway. You wonder what you should or should not do. Should you strongly
		  and vehemently indicate your displeasure? Should you tell Jennifer that she
		  could have easily acquired the facts had she made the least effort? Or should
		  you say nothing, hoping that no harm will come from the speech? Would it
		  make any difference to you if you knew that Jennifer had high anxiety and
	  low self esteem? (from Jacksha and Pritchard, Communication Ethics) </p>
		<p><strong>Moderator's Answer:</strong> As a student in the public speaking
		  class a key part of you learning experience involves analyzing and discussing
		  in public
		    the work of other students in class. If you feel pressured to remain
		  silent then you are not receiving the educational experience to which you
		  are entitled.
		    Furthermore, since the purpose of the course is to learn about effective
		    public speaking you will benefit Jennifer by pointing out the respects
		  in which her speech needs improvement, provided you do it in a way that remains
		    within the bounds appropriate for a class discussion. Some people
		  take criticism
		    better then others, but no one can learn without it.<br>
      </p>
		<p><strong>(6)</strong> Puredrug is a large global pharmaceutical company which is currently
		  facing a declining market share and weak profits. Puredrug has an opportunity
		  to sign an $8 million sales contract with the Philippine Government
		  for a new drug called Travenol, used for treating viral infections, including
		  measles.
		  Travenol is in short supply because it is difficult and expensive to
		  manufacture. Puredrug's inventory contains a large batch of Travenol produced
		  at a cost
		  of $2 million. The U.S. Government rejected this batch for the domestic
		  market, however, on the basis of a new, very sensitive test for toxic substances.
		  The test revealed a low level of a toxic substance called endotoxin
		  in the
		  batch of Travenol. The old test used by the U.S. Government uncovered
		  no endotoxin. The Philippines relies exclusively on the old test. Endotoxin
		  might cause high fever. No one can say definitively, however, if Puredrug's
		  batch of Travenol has enough endotoxin in it to produce this result
		  in patients.
		  Last year half of the Philippine children who contracted measles died.
	  (New York Times, 2/13/94) </p>
		<p>Would it be absolutely wrong for Puredurg to sign
		    the sales agreement
	    with the Philippine government? If so, why? If not, why not? </p>
		<p><strong>Moderator's Answer:</strong> It would be morally permissible for
		  Puredrug to sign the sales agreement provided that it clearly informs the
		  Philippine
		    Government about the test results under the new test. Puredrug may
		  reasonably assume that the Philippine Government has set up procedures to
		  assure the
		    safety of drugs used in the Philippines, but Puredrug must disclose
		  all the relevant information for an informed decision. The sale raises public
		  relations
		    issues related to Puredrug's image which concern the responsibility
		  of Puredrug's management with respect to its shareholders. So long as the
		  management deals
		    with these issues reasonably and in good faith, however, then it
		  meets these responsibilities. <br>
        </p>
		<p><strong>(7) </strong>Dr. William Knees of George Washington University Medical Center has
		  invented a computerized system to estimate the probability that a critically
		  ill patient will live or die. The system, known as APACHE, estimates
		  a patient;s short term probability of dying by comparing his or her characteristics
		  --
		  such as age, blood pressure, and breathing difficulty -- to a compute
		  analysis of 200,000 previous cases. APACHE, and similar systems, have been
		  used by
		  hospitals for about ten years to study death rates among groups of
		  patients to evaluate the performance of different hospitals and the effectiveness
		  of various treatment methods. For example, APACHE was used to compare
		  the
		  quality of intensive care units in 29 hospitals. According to Dr. Knees,
		  APACHE predicted the death rates of more than 37,000 patients in this
		  study with 90% accuracy. Now under intense pressure to cut costs, proposals
		  are
		  being put forward for hospitals to use APACHE to decide what to do
		  with individual patients -- e.g. whether to initiate emergency treatment.	  </p>
		<p>Should the APACHE system be used for this kind of purpose in connection
		    with treatment decisions for individual patients? If so, why? If
		  not, why not? </p>
		<p><strong>Moderator's Answer:</strong> It would be morally unjustifiable to use the
		    Apache
		    system to determine whether or not to initiate emergency treatment
		    of a hospital patient. The Apache system is an appropriate tool for
		  evaluating medical
		    procedures, but not for making treatment decisions in connection
		  with individual patients. Physicians have a professional responsibility to
		  treat
		    patients
		    on the basis of an assessment of their individual needs. In the case
		    of critical emergency treatment, the patients' need, clearly, is
		  to survive. This rules
		    out deciding whether to attempt a particular treatment of a patient
		    upon an analysis of statistical data, as would be done with the Apache
		  system. <br>

		<p><strong>(8)</strong> Janet, a fourteen year old who has just completed ninth grade, is a
		  member of a youth orchestra scheduled to tour throughout Europe during
		  the summer. The orchestra consists of outstanding young musicians throughout
		  the United States who auditioned for the orchestra. All through the
		  school
		  year each orchestra member had to learn his or her parts of the very
		  difficult music for the program in preparation for three weeks of intensive
		  rehearsing
		  in June at a summer music camp in northern Minnesota before departing
		  for Europe. Janet has worked very hard and during the first week of rehearsal
		  is selected for the first violin section. Janet, delighted with her
		  success,
		  intensifies her concentration on rehearsing, and looks forward eagerly
		  to the tour which will begin in two weeks. During the middle of the second
		  week
		  of Janet's rehearsal a sudden tragedy occurs back home. A close friend
		  of Janet named Shawn, a sixteen year old boy, who Janet dated for about four
		  months, is killed accidentally when he collides with a motor boat while
		  swimming
		  after sun down.</p>
		<p>Should Janet's parents inform her about Shawn's death
		    in the week and a half remaining before Janet goes to Europe with
		  the youth orchestra, or
		    should they not tell her until she returns in the middle of August?
		    In either case, give your reasons. </p>
		<p><strong>Moderator's Answer</strong>: Janet's parents must inform her of Shawn's death in
		  the week and a half before Janet goes to Europe. It is understandable that
		  Janet's parents would want to preserve for her the opportunity to experience
		  her concert tour in the right frame of mind to enjoy and benefit from the
		  tour to the fullest extent. At Janet's age (14), however, a more important
		  consideration, from an ethical standpoint, is whether they believe Janet
		  would want to know about Shawn's death immediately, or whether she would
		  want her parents to withhold the information about his death from her until
		  she returns from Europe. Unless Janet has highly unusual attitudes in this
		  regard, her parents must assume she would want to know immediately.</p>
