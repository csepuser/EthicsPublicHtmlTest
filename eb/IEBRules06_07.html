    <p></p>
    <h3><a name="Org"></a>Organization</h3>
    <p><strong>IEB Executive Board</strong></p>
    <p>The membership of the IEB Executive Board will consist of one representative
      from each regional ethics bowl and an IEB Executive Board Chair. Each regional
      ethics bowl will decide who its representative will be. The Executive Board
      will have decision making authority and responsibility on all issues to
      be resolved in connection with planning and implementation of the reorganized
      IEB. In this regard, the IEB Executive Board will review and make final
      decisions concerning the recommendations of all reorganization/planning
      subcommittees. Also, it will make final decisions concerning issues such
      as the permanent organizational structure of the reorganized IEB (i.e.
      beyond the planning and recommendation period), and the entrance criteria
      for new regional ethics bowls into the reorganized IEB.</p>
    <p><strong>Chair&#8217;s Advisory Council (CAC)</strong></p>
    <p>The CAC will be a group with whom the Executive Board Chair can confer
      on a regular informal basis as the planning and implementation processes
      go forward (August 2005 &#8211; February 2007). In addition, the CAC will
      develop a proposal for submission to the IEB Executive Board for a permanent
      organizational structure of the reorganized IEB, beyond the planning and
      implementation period.</p>
    <h3><br>
      <a name="Regional"></a>Regional IEB Rules</h3>
    <p><strong>Rules for School Eligibility</strong></p>
    <p>A school may send unlimited teams to a regional bowl. If it sends multiple
      teams, it must specify which teams are linked and which are not. Linked
      teams are closely connected &#8211; e.g. the same faculty sponsor, preparation
      together in the came class or ethics bowl club, or participation in the
      same intramural ethics bowl, etc. Unlinked teams are those without major
      connections &#8211; e.g. consisting of students from different colleges,
      with significantly different courses of study, within a large university.</p>
    <p>If any of a group of linked teams is eligible for the national bowl, a
      single team may be formed with members of any linked teams in the group
      for the national bowl, but only one space can be earned at the national
      bowl, no matter how well the linked teams perform at the regional bowl.
      If teams are not linked, each team is independently eligible for the national
      bowl, but members may not be switched from one team to another.</p>
    <p><strong>Rule for Student Eligibility</strong></p>
    <p>Members of a school&#8217;s team must be undergraduate students currently
      enrolled at the school. </p>
    <p><strong>Rules for participating in multiple regional bowls:</strong></p>
    <p>A school may take part in more than one regional bowl. However, the school
      must notify the IEB Executive Board prior to ANY of the bowls which one
      it will use as a qualifier for the national bowl.</p>
    <p><br>
        <strong>Number of teams at the National Bowl (2006-07)</strong></p>
    <p>There will be <strong>thirty-two (32)</strong> participating teams.</p>
    <p><br>
        <strong>Qualifying Rules for teams to advance from regional bowls to
        the national bowl:</strong></p>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div>There will be thirty-two (32) participating teams in the National
      Ethics Bowl.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>The number of teams each regional bowl sends to the national
            bowl each year will depend on the total number of participating regional
            bowls and
          the size
          of the particular regional bowl</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>The default number of teams sent by
            a regional bowl will be D=32/N where N is the number of regional
        bowls participating, and D is the
              default number
              of teams sent.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>If a regional bowl has fewer than 10 unlinked teams,
            the default number of teams it will send to the national bowl is
        D-1.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>The remaining spaces will be filled in by the procedure outlined
                      in the appendix.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div> Each regional bowl will therefore have
            a claim on a particular number of spaces, S. Each bowl will fill
        those spaces with
                          the top S teams
                          from its region.
                          Should a team be unable to attend the national bowl,
        its space will go to the next highest ranked team, until all
                          S spaces
        are filled. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div> Each regional bowl will use scoring rules
            that make it possible to rank teams from top to bottom<br><br>
            <em>Appendix</em>
            <blockquote>
          <div>
            The additional spaces up to 32 are allocated to the regional bowls based on
                      the odds of a team from that regional bowl moving on. The first space is
                      allocated to the regional bowl with the lowest odds, the second space to
                      the regional bowl with the second lowest odds, and so forth. Ties are broken
                      by counting the number of schools involved (the higher the better) then total
                      number of unlinked and linked teams (the higher the better), then by coin
                  toss. </div>
        </blockquote>
        <div><em>Example:</em>   Assume that there are 8 bowls, with the following number
          of unlinked teams in each bowl:</div>
        <blockquote>
          <div>Bowl A 8<br>
            Bowl B 8<br>
            Bowl C 8<br>
            Bowl D 9<br>
            Bowl E 11<br>
            Bowl F 13<br>
            Bowl G 15<br>
            Bowl H 18
            </p>
          </div>
        </blockquote>
        <div>The initial distribution of spaces for each bowl would be:</div>
        <blockquote>
          <div>Bowl A 3<br>
              Bowl B 3<br>
              Bowl C 3<br>
              Bowl D 3<br>
              Bowl E 4<br>
              Bowl F 4<br>
              Bowl G 4<br>
            Bowl H 4
            </p>
          </div>
        </blockquote>
        <div>This would leave 4 open spaces. We calculate the odds of moving on from
              a particular bowl:</div>
        <blockquote>
          <div>Bowl A 3/8=37.5%<br>
              Bowl B 3/8=37.5%<br>
              Bowl C 3/8=37.5%<br>
              Bowl D 3/9= 33%<br>
              Bowl E 4/11=36.3%<br>
              Bowl F 4/13=30%<br>
              Bowl G 4/15=26%<br>
            Bowl H 4/18=22%
            </p>
          </div>
        </blockquote>
        <div>So the four spaces would go to the following bowls:</div>
        <blockquote>
          <div>Bowl H 22%<br>
              Bowl G 26%<br>
              Bowl F 30%<br>
            Bowl D 33%
            </p>
          </div>
        </blockquote>
        <div><br>
          <strong>Dates:</strong></div><br>
        <div>Regional bowls must be held in time for teams to accept an invitation
                      to the national bowl by December 15. Teams must confirm by this date or
        risk losing their space.</div><br>
        <div><strong>Rules variations in regional bowls:</strong></div><br>
        <div>Regional bowls are expected to use the national bowl&#8217;s rules,
            guidelines, and scoring rubric, with the following exceptions:</div><br>
        <ol>
         <li type="a">Regional bowls are <u>not</u> required to conduct a straight elimination
                                  match of the top scoring teams in the three morning
                  matches, as provided for under the national rules. However, regional
                  bowls must
                  adopt scoring
            rules that enable them to rank teams from top to bottom. </li>
          <li type="a">Under certain conditions
                      other alterations will be allowed, such as the following:<br>
               Minor adjustments to timing and other rules are allowed without
                                  prior approval, but require notification to the IEB
                      Executive Board, and, where appropriate,
                                  post-bowl reports about the effects of these adjustments.
                      Preapproved variations include:<br>
                <ol>
                  <li> initial presentations may run from 7 to 12 minutes.</li>
                          <li> commentary on initial presentations may run from 5 to
                                      8 minutes.</li>
                          <li> ratio of presenting team to opposing team
                        scores may not exceed 5:1.</li>
                          <li>judges&#8217; Q&amp;A need not be restricted to
                            one Q and one follow-up;</li>
                          <li>Judges&#8217; Q&amp;A may be expanded
                                    from 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                          <li> response to commentary may be shortened in favor
                            of lengthening the judges&#8217; Q&amp;A
                                    period.</li>
                          <li> rules regarding the number of members of a team that
                                          may speak during any particular part of the round
                              may be changed
                        without prior consent. </li>
            </ol>
                      <p><em>Experiments involving more significant changes require</em> approval from the
                                  IEB Executive Board and require reports about the effects of these changes.
                                  The regional bowls can serve as test beds for useful experimentation, with
                                  successful experiments ultimately being adopted by the national bowl (and
                                  therefore the other regional bowls). However, changes that alter the essential
                                  nature of the event as an academic competition will be turned down by the
                      executive board.

                                          following criteria:<br>
            <br>
            Clarity and Intelligibility - Was the presentation clear and systematic? Regardless
                                      of whether or not you agree with the conclusion, did the team give a coherent
                                      argument in a clear and succinct manner? <br>
            <br>
            Avoidance of Ethical Irrelevance: Did the team avoid ethically irrelevant issues?
                                      Or was the team preoccupied with issues that are not ethically relevant or
                                      are of minor ethical relevance to the case?<br>
            <br>
            Identification and Discussion of Central
                                      Ethical Dimensions: Did the team&#8217;s
                                      presentation clearly identify and thoroughly
                                      discuss the central ethical dimensions
                                      of the case? <br>
            <br>
            Deliberative Thoughtfulness: Did the team&#8217;s presentation indicate both
                                      awareness and thoughtful consideration of different viewpoints, including especially
                                      those that would loom large in the reasoning of individuals who disagree with
                                      the team&#8217;s position?<br>
          </li>

            <strong>0-40 for a team's answer to the Moderator's question (40 best); In
                                      evaluating a team's answer the judges will give the team a score of 0-10 relative
                                      to each of the four evaluation criteria indicated above and total the sum.<br>
            <br>
            0-10 for the opposing team's commentary (10 best);<br>
            <br>
            0-10 for the response to the opposing team&#8217;s commentary,

                                      question (10 best).<br>
            <br>
            Both in evaluating a team's commentary, and the other team's response to the
                                      commentary, the judges will take into account the four evaluation criteria
                                      indicated above, but give the teams an overall score, rather than a separate

                              Thus, all teams with three wins will rank ahead
