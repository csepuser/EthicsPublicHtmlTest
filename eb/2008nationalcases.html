		<p> </p>
		<p><strong>CASE 1</strong></p>
		<p>Angela sat numbly as her sentence was read, chilled with the same sinking
		  feeling that gripped her when she and Kate had been arrested. 30 days in
		  jail!</p>
		<p>What they did was just so stupid. They&#8217;d gone out for a couple of
		  drinks after their last final, before leaving college for the summer. They
		  were hungry, and Kate suggested going someplace really nice for dinner. Neither
		  one could afford it, but that wasn&#8217;t going to be a problem. They ordered
		  dessert after the meal. Kate excused herself, and when dessert came, Angela
		  told the waiter she&#8217;d better check on her friend, who might have had
		  too much to drink. Angela slipped out the door and into the parking lot where
		  Kate was waiting with the car&#8217;s motor running. They took off, giggling
		  over their escapade. To their dismay, two waiters and the manager blocked
		  the exit, and shortly after, the police arrived.</p>
		<p>Kate&#8217;s parents hired a good lawyer for her, but neither Angela nor
		  her parents had that kind of money. Kate and Angela were tried separately,
		  and although they were charged with the same offense, their sentences were
		  quite different. Kate&#8217;s lawyer was aware of California&#8217;s Pay-to-stay
		  jail program, and had come to court prepared with a pre-arranged acceptance
		  letter from the jail to use in the event of a conviction and jail sentence.
		  The lawyer had made arrangements by phone by providing the charges, court,
		  judge and case number, and contact information for Kate's employer. Kate
		  paid $108 cash per night for a room pretty much like her college dorm room,
		  certainly cleaner and safer than the overcrowded and sometimes violent regular
		  cells. Even if Angela had been aware of the Pay-to-stay program (information
		  about the program is not universally publicized nor offered: it often must
		  be requested by the attorney), she could not afford it. Angela was assigned
		  a barred cell that she shared with another prisoner.</p>
		<p>The difference between the sentences was not limited to the type of cell.
		  Because Kate was in the Pay-to-stay program, she was allowed to leave jail
		  during the day for work release, able to keep her summer job and continue
		  earning income. She did have to return to jail at night, but she returned
		  to relative quiet and privacy. Kate was able to have her laptop and mp3 player,
		  so she could watch movies and listen to music. Angela was not allowed to
		  leave jail at all during the 30 days, and unfortunately, lost her job because
		  she was gone from it for a month. She wasn&#8217;t allowed a computer, mp3
		  player, or cell phone. She was able to get a book from the library cart a
		  few days after she was incarcerated, but before that she mostly spent her
		  time lying on her bunk with nothing to do. The constant noise and lack of
		  both privacy and cleanliness were stressful, but Angela&#8217;s greatest
		  source of distress was feeling unprepared to defend herself from gangs and
		  prison violence. She didn&#8217;t know how she could go a month without bathing,
		  but she was terrified of the communal showers.</p>
		<p>The cost per day of keeping a person in jail varies significantly from one
		  locale to another, but runs into the tens of thousands of dollars per inmate
		  per year. California has about a dozen &#8220;Pay-to-stay&#8221; jails that
		  have been in operation for the past several years, purportedly providing
		  a source of revenue for programs that benefit all prisoners.</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 2</strong></p>
		<p>Glen and Joy Stiller had lived in their neighborhood&#8212;Placid Park&#8212;for
		  fifteen years before Blair and Belle Clanghorne built a house on the lot
		  next door and moved in. For a full year before they arrived, the builders
		  had been banging and sawing away at odd hours, seeming to prefer working
		  only on nights and weekends. The Stillers had hoped the noise level would
		  drop when the construction was complete, but they were mistaken. In July,
		  the Clanghornes arrived with their five children and two nervous dogs, and
		  proceeded to celebrate their new house every weekend during August.</p>
		<p>Placid Park is a rural subdivision just outside the recently incorporated
		  village of Forest Green, Texas, which is thirty miles away from any town
		  and sixty miles from any city. When the Stillers first arrived, Forest Green
		  had only one stoplight. Now there were four. Fifteen years earlier, Forest
		  Green had not even been a township, only a loose collection of houses, retail
		  stores, and retirement communities. But as more people discovered the joys
		  of living closer to nature and away from the hassles of the city, the village
		  grew. Eventually the residents voted to incorporate. Only a few laws were
		  on the books at the time the Clanghornes arrived - and nothing similar to
		  a nuisance ordinance, so the Stillers knew they could not turn to the village
		  for help.</p>
		<p>The lots in Placid Park are big enough to ensure a certain amount of privacy:
		  nothing smaller than two acres is permitted. Nevertheless, sound travels
		  far in rural areas. The PP Property Owners&#8217; Association had passed
		  several deed restrictions, but those only covered the appearance and the
		  upkeep of property, not the noise level. The Stillers decided to wait and
		  see if their neighbors quieted down when the novelty of the new house wore
		  off.</p>
		<p>The Clanghornes did not just happen to pick the house next door from among
		  all the vacant lots: they particularly wanted that one. The lot, as well
		  as that of the Stillers, lay on the perimeter of Placid Park. Their back
		  yards bordered on a sixty-acre tract of land, entirely outside the subdivision,
		  owned by Mrs. Clanghorne&#8217;s parents. The Stillers had frequently heard,
		  to their irritation, loud noises from an unmuffled recreational four-wheeler
		  that the various Clanghornes enjoyed racing up and down a hill in the sixty-acre
		  lot just beyond the property lines.</p>
		<p>On Labor Day, the Stillers suffered through two hours of unbearable racket
		  as friends of the Clanghornes brought over three more four-wheelers and tore
		  around the neighborhood, doing wheelies and racing up and down the once peaceful
		  streets. Finally fed up, the Stillers approached their neighbors and asked
		  them not to make so much noise. Belle Clanghorne said, &#8220;I can sort
		  of understand your feelings, but one of the reasons we moved out to the country
		  was so we could do this sort of stuff. You know, they won&#8217;t let you
		  have these things in the city. We&#8217;re just thinking about buying another
		  four-wheeler, and our friends have brought them over for us to try out.&#8221; Glen
		  Stiller replied, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t the country. This is a neighborhood.
		  You&#8217;re not the only ones who live here. Please show a little respect
		  for everyone else.&#8221; Soon, the noise stopped, but within twenty minutes
		  started up again, only this time in the sixty acres just behind their houses.
		  The noise continued for another two hours.</p>
		<p>The next morning, on wild hunch, Glen Stiller went online and googled the
		  phrase &#8220;directional speakers.&#8221; To his grim satisfaction, he discovered
		  a small company with a revolutionary product that &#8220;up converted&#8221; audible
		  sound waves into ultrasound, and beamed them in a focused ray that could
		  not be heard. When the ray struck an object, like a wall, or a window, the
		  waves &#8220;down converted&#8221; back into audible sound and effectively
		  turned the object itself into a loudspeaker. A person actually standing in
		  the beam would hear the sound as though it came from inside his or her head.
		  The device was intended for use as a cheap substitute for a loudspeaker in
		  places where a traditional sound system would be too difficult or expensive
		  to install. But Glen suspected the Clanghorne&#8217;s dining room window
		  would make a nice loudspeaker for a really obnoxious racecar video game he
		  had just bought. It wouldn&#8217;t have to be too loud, not loud enough to
		  bother anyone but the Clanghornes.</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 3</strong></p>
		<p>Vicki Marks is a rural Michigan veterinarian who practices among the ever
		  more pricey and prevalent vacation homes nestled along Lake Huron. These
		  days she comes home from her animal hospital troubled&#8211;more so than
		  ever before for a professional who must routinely treat disease and injury
		  with euthanasia. Increasingly, her clients are seeking care to prolong the
		  life of deeply loved, yet critically ill or injured pets, with little concern
		  for money and, in some cases, the potential suffering of their wards. Dr.
		  Marks&#8217; training taught her to recognize pain in animals that their
		  owners often are unable to discern. Unexpressed pain is especially common
		  with dogs, as they are pack animals and avoid displaying overt signs of pain
		  so not to disturb the pack or weaken their position in it. Some pets conceal
		  suffering when they sense the distress of their owners.</p>
		<p>Even when she feels reasonably certain that she can adequately treat pain
		  and discomfort, Marks is reluctant, even loath, to take extraordinary measures
		  to prolong the life of a pet. A few years back, she treated a failing Siamese
		  cat with two rounds of chemotherapy, providing a few extra months of companionship
		  for its owner, even though chemotherapy in animals is indicated for easing
		  symptoms rather than prolonging life. &#8220;When I look back on it, I can&#8217;t
		  believe I agreed to do it. It was crazy. Six-months and $6,000 later, even
		  my client, Ms. Park, confided she really should have let him go sooner. Did
		  I take advantage of my client? I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s what some outside
		  observers might conclude.&#8221; At $2.9 billion, the pharmaceutical market
		  for small animals exceeded that for farm animals for the first time in 2005.
		  Venality aside, veterinarians like Marks find it difficult to square their
		  complicity in a bloated pet pharmaceuticals market with their anguish over
		  the millions of lost and unwanted animals they euthanize each year.</p>
		<p>Suzanne Njaal, a South African veterinarian, sees the issue of prolonged
		  care in larger terms that run to the heart of her profession. When she began
		  her practice three decades ago, veterinarians concentrated on keeping farm
		  animals healthy to protect the human food supply. Instead of treatment, doctors
		  quickly sacrificed very sick animals to save the herd. Pets typically remained
		  outside, sheltered in out buildings and rarely provided with medical care
		  beyond the most basic. Today, she points out, veterinary practice is overwhelmingly
		  the preserve of small animal practitioners, with almost three-quarters of
		  general practice veterinary incomes in the developed world stemming from
		  the treatment of domestic animals. Consequently, the profession places its
		  main economic and social emphasis on this sector, and research and teaching
		  are similarly redirected. &#8220;This shift has led us away from what we
		  profess our concerns to be&#8211;the needs of patients, and the safety of
		  the public,&#8221; protests Njaal. &#8220;Our priorities need to change.&#8221;</p>
		<p>Marks, too, is pessimistic. &#8220;I realize clients willing to shell out
		  extraordinary sums for extraordinary measures sounds ideal from a business
		  perspective, but I worry about what is becoming of the ethics of my profession,
		  and I wring my hands over what to do. I signed on to serve animals and society,
		  not just wealthy pet owners.&#8221;</p>
		<p>Concerned practitioners face a difficult task in changing the attitudes
		  of clients when it comes to end of life care for pets. New professional orientation
		  of veterinarians and the expanding market for pharmaceuticals reflects societal
		  upheaval. In an affluent society where traditional social institutions are
		  frayed and mobility severs family ties, pet owners are comforted by the unquestioning
		  love of their animals, and the intense bond between them and their pets.
		  A 2002 survey for the American Veterinary Medical Association found that
		  47% of people viewed their pets as family members.</p>
		<p>Today, Vicki Marks took a difficult step. A distraught young gentleman of
		  obvious means brought his cat, Bob, to her clinic. Bob was suffering from
		  advanced kidney failure. Bob&#8217;s owner had done his homework and asked
		  about the viability of dialysis and other options. Dr. Marks refused to consider
		  these treatments. In the end, after doing her best to be compassionate, she
		  sent him away.</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 4</strong></p>
		<p>From 1980 to 1990, the sleepy rural town of Palmdale, just outside of Los
		  Angeles experienced record growth from 12,000 to 68,000 residents. In the1990s,
		  anticipating population growth that would rival that of the fastest growing
		  cities in the United States, the community annexed nearby rural areas. In
		  the years leading up to 2006, Palmdale rapidly expanded as a bedroom community
		  for commuters who work in Los Angeles.</p>
		<p>Despite having a population of approximately 589,000 in 2007, and being
		  the fourth largest city in the Mojave Dessert (surpassed only by the three
		  cities which make up the Las Vegas metropolitan region), nearly 40% of the
		  city&#8217;s land is vacant, rural land. To cope with this growth, Palmdale
		  has extended the reach of city codes and regulations to the annexed areas,
		  including regulations regarding the ownership and housing of domesticated
		  animals.</p>
		<p>In January of 2006, Linda Papineau, a landowner and resident of Palmdale
		  since 1986, was cited for running an illegal dog kennel. Local code enforcement
		  officers who were sent to her residence to serve a warrant for having too
		  many dogs on the property found that Papineau had 104 dogs. They also found
		  her home to be in generally uninhabitable condition.</p>
		<p>Upon closer inspection, one of the officers saw that the animals were emaciated.
		  Large amounts of fecal matter had accumulated both in the yard and inside
		  the house, and a powerful stench of urine emanated from inside the home.
		  The house suffered from the additional code violations of having shattered
		  windows, a damaged roof, and broken pipes. A local Building and Safety Inspector
		  posted a sign on Papineau&#8217;s property, declaring it uninhabitable until
		  repaired.</p>
		<p>Of the 104 dogs, Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control officials impounded
		  59 of the dogs that were found to be unsuitable for adoption, having no or
		  minimal socialization. Papineau was ordered to find new homes for the remaining
		  45 dogs. She was allowed to return to her home, where the remaining dogs
		  were staying, to care for them, but was not permitted to sleep in the house
		  due to its uninhabitable condition.</p>
		<p>That the dogs were emaciated seemed unusual, since code officers found plentiful
		  supplies of dog food. Papineau maintained throughout the investigation that
		  she had rescued the animals - in rough physical and emotional condition and
		  in general ill health when she found them, and brought them home. Explaining
		  the condition of the animals, she maintained that it takes some time to recover
		  from abuse and malnourishment.</p>
		<p>In her defense, Papineau asserted that when she bought her 2 1/2 acres in
		  1986, her property was outside of existing city limits, and was zoned for
		  agriculture. The old zoning laws permitted kennels. It was only after the
		  land was annexed by the city that the area was rezoned, and dog owners were
		  limited to no more than 2 animals.</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 5</strong></p>
		<p>In 1999, Anna Mae He was born prematurely to parents Shaoqiang and Qin Luo
		  He. Because of Anna Mae&#8217;s premature birth, Shaoqiang and Luo struggled
		  to provide for her medical needs with inadequate health coverage.</p>
		<p>Friends from church, Jerry and Louise Baker, with four of their own children,
		  agreed to take in three-week-old Anna Mae. The Hes arranged a 90-day foster
		  care placement with the Bakers through a local agency. During this time,
		  the Hes&#8217; financial situation deteriorated dramatically, both now having
		  to work at local restaurants to make ends meet. Shaoqiang was accused by
		  a fellow student of sexual assault, and lost his research position at the
		  university. Though the charges were dismissed, Shaoqiang did not return to
		  work and study at the university. This turn of events made an extension of
		  Anna Mae's placement with the Bakers the best option for the child. When
		  the initial 90-day term ended, both couples agreed to continue the arrangement,
		  and the Hes signed papers agreeing to grant the Bakers custody.</p>
		<p>The Hes visited Anna Mae weekly until the relationship between the families
		  deteriorated. Because Shaoqiang's student visa was now expired, the couple
		  faced deportation proceedings, which would force the family to return to
		  China. They refused to leave without Anna Mae. The conflict between the families
		  peaked in 2002 when the Bakers called police after the Hes again requested
		  that Anna Mae be returned to them. Believing they would be arrested if they
		  tried to visit Anna Mae again, their visits stopped, as did the child support
		  they had been paying the Bakers for Anna Mae&#8217;s care. Four months later,
		  the Bakers filed for termination of the Hes&#8217; parental rights, a necessary
		  precursor to legal adoption of Anna Mae.</p>
		<p>Responding to the Bakers&#8217; claim that the child no longer had any connection
		  to her biological parents, Chancery Court Judge Robert Childers of Memphis
		  terminated the Hes' parental rights, ruling that they had abandoned their
		  daughter. In his ruling, the judge characterized the couple&#8217;s fight
		  for their daughter as selfishly motivated by their fear that they would be
		  deported and their assumption the child (a United States Citizen) could provide
		  them with a claim to remain in the United States. Childers agreed with the
		  Bakers&#8217; claim that it was in Anna Mae&#8217;s best interest to remain
		  in the US because her life would be endangered if she were taken to China,
		  citing a high infant-mortality rate for girls and China&#8217;s &#8216;one
		  child&#8217; policy.</p>
		<p>According to a report in the Los Angeles Times (February 17, 2005), when
		  they heard the decision, Shaoqiang said, &#8220;We couldn't even speak. We
		  couldn't even breathe.&#8221;</p>
		<p>In January 2007, ruling on the Hes&#8217; appeal, the Tennessee Supreme
		  Court said Judge Childers wrongly terminated the couple's parental rights.
		  According to the ruling, the Supreme Court concluded, &#8220;Financial advantage
		  and affluent surroundings simply may not be a consideration in determining
		  a custody dispute between a parent and a non-parent.&#8221; The ruling included
		  an order to reunite the child with her biological parents.</p>
		<p>Commenting on the Supreme Court Ruling in the same Los Angeles Times report, &#8220;It&#8217;s
		  not the job of the court to find a better set of parents for a child,&#8221; said
		  Christina A. Zawisza, associate professor of clinical law at the University
		  of Memphis. &#8220;The state doesn't have the right to second-guess parents
		  unless the child would be in danger.&#8221;</p>
		<p>The Bakers&#8217; subsequent appeal to the US Supreme Court has since been
		  refused. The now 8-year-old Anna Mae will be required to leave the only family
		  she has ever known and return to her biological parents. According to an
		  Associated Press report from January 24, 2007, Larry Parrish, the Bakers&#8217; attorney,
		  claims Anna Mae &#8220;has not wanted to have any conversation about it.
		  She will close up her ears and run in another room. It's just how you make
		  the best of the worst situation.&#8221;</p>
		<p>Responding this turn of events, Shaoqiang (quoted by the Associated Press
		  on January 24, 2007) said, &#8220;We want our child to remember their kindness
		  and their love.&#8221; The Hes had two more children during this period. &#8220;When
		  she wakes up each morning, she'll wake up and see her mother and daddy and
		  her brother and sister, and we'll all have the same faces she has.&#8221;</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 6</strong></p>
		<p>Julia lives in a modest working class residential neighborhood of single-family
		  homes, where she raised her three children and enjoys visits from her grandchildren.
		  Signs of wear gradually crept into the neighborhood since Julia and her husband
		  moved in with their young family thirty years ago. She is grateful that taxes
		  have stayed low, allowing her to remain in her home, but has watched with
		  some concern the consequences of defeated ballot measures: lack of street
		  repairs; delayed maintenance on public buildings; and a poor rating for the
		  local school due to downsized curriculum, elimination of extracurricular
		  activities, and classroom overcrowding. Today, another issue of overcrowding
		  is on her mind as Julia and three of her neighbors are discussing over coffee
		  one of the houses on their street.</p>
		<p>&#8220;There are at least eighteen that I know have been living there for
		  the past seven months&#8221;, stated Diane. &#8220;That house has the same
		  floor plan as mine, and I was in it often before Kristen and her family moved
		  away. There are only three small bedrooms, and a partial basement. There&#8217;s
		  an attic, but it&#8217;s not tall enough to stand in, and it&#8217;s reached
		  by a trap door in the ceiling. I can&#8217;t imagine how all those people
		  can live there!&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8220;Diane, how do you know there are eighteen?&#8221; asked Ann.</p>
		<p>&#8220; At least eighteen. There were so many it made me curious enough
		  to actually keep track. There are three men, six women, and at least nine
		  kids for certain. I don&#8217;t think it should be allowed!&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Julia. &#8220;They seem like nice, hard-working
		  people who are just trying to make a living&#8221;.</p>
		<p>&#8220;The house needs paint, the roof looks bad, and the screens are torn.
		  It&#8217;s probably a mess inside, if the outside is any indication. There
		  are all these junky cars parked in the street, and by garbage day the cans
		  are overflowing. I don&#8217;t think illegal aliens should be allowed here
		  at all, let alone so many crowded into one tiny house,&#8221; Karen responded
		  heatedly.</p>
		<p>Ann asked, &#8220;Do you know for sure they&#8217;re here illegally? Are
		  you assuming that because they struggle with English that they are not legal
		  residents? They might just as easily be family or friends who are having
		  trouble making ends meet and need to live together to have a roof over their
		  children&#8217;s heads. Don&#8217;t you remember when Danny and his family
		  stayed with me, and Tim and his family stayed with our other brother? When
		  the mill closed in my hometown, both my brothers lost their jobs. As people
		  moved away, housing prices crashed. They couldn&#8217;t stay because there
		  was no work, they couldn&#8217;t sell their homes, and they had no money
		  to leave. Affordable housing is such a problem. It was nearly impossible
		  for my brothers either to rent or buy anything. So many communities have
		  housing restrictions, and builders prefer to cater to the wealthy market
		  rather than build affordable housing. That&#8217;s understandable as they&#8217;re
		  in business, but we don&#8217;t have social programs to address the housing
		  need. A newspaper article I read said that many people pay over half their
		  income for mortgages and that people on minimum wage have trouble renting
		  even a two-bedroom apartment. It also said that it is impossible for someone
		  working full-time making the increased minimum wage to rent a small two-bedroom
		  apartment anywhere in the country. And I'm hearing about more and more people
		  who are losing their homes in foreclosures. &#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8220;What really worries me is safety,&#8221; said Diane. &#8220;Kristen
		  always complained that the furnace wasn&#8217;t very good, and they had to
		  use space heaters sometimes. As they added hairdryers and audio equipment
		  and other electronics, the fuses blew regularly. She was always worried about
		  fire.&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8220;I think we should report our concerns to the city, or start a petition,&#8221; said
		  Karen. &#8220;People in the neighborhood are getting upset with how overcrowded
		  and run-down the place is. And all these kids that are overwhelming the school!&#8221;</p>
		<p>&#8220;I disagree!&#8221; said Ann firmly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if
		  they are here legally or not, and I don&#8217;t understand why that matters
		  to you. I agree with Julie that they seem to be good people trying to make
		  a living and make a better life for their children. I know how hard you worked
		  to give your kids a future, and what a difference it made to my brothers
		  that Michael and I could help them. Can you imagine how traumatic it would
		  be for our neighbors to be targeted or investigated, especially with limited
		  language proficiency and worrying about the children?&#8221;</p>
		<p>Julia didn&#8217;t know what she thought. Families should help each other.
		  She was very worried about the safety of all those people in that tiny house,
		  especially with a cold winter approaching. If they reported their concerns,
		  the families could be investigated and forced into an even more hazardous
		  situation. On the other hand, if there were a fire and anyone was hurt, she
		  would never forgive herself. If they did report their concerns, would the
		  consequences be safety or harassment?</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 7</strong></p>
		<p>The Bay Delta, formed at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
		  Rivers, is the largest estuary on the West Coast, covering 738,000 acres
		  or a 1,250-square-mile expanse of farmland, sloughs, and marshes connected
		  to San Francisco Bay. Much of the land is below sea level and relies on more
		  than 1,000 miles of levees for protection against flooding.</p>
		<p>The agricultural belt of the Central Valley, which is the backbone of the
		  California economy, depends on fresh water pumped from the delta to the various
		  agricultural regions via a system of sloughs and aqueducts. Agriculture is
		  a $30 billion industry in California, providing approximately 15-20% of the
		  nation&#8217;s agricultural products, and employing over 500,000 agricultural
		  workers (24% of the workforce) from Redding in the north, to Bakersfield
		  in the south.</p>
		<p>The Central Valley includes the community of Fresno, which in 2006 was credited
		  with the nation&#8217;s worst poverty. At 43.5%, Fresno leads the nation
		  in the percentage of poor residents; a trend exacerbated over the last 30
		  years as a result of a six-fold growth in the city&#8217;s immigrant population,
		  a population that is almost entirely dependent upon farm labor as a source
		  of employment. Fresno is not the only poor community in the area, however.
		  The Central Valley has the state&#8217;s worst poverty, educational attainment,
		  and health statistics. Yet it is home to a variety of vibrant, hard working
		  communities, which are economically dependent upon agriculture, either directly
		  or indirectly.</p>
		<p>Agriculture uses approximately 40-50% of the state&#8217;s total annual
		  water resources. The two major pumping stations, located near Tracy, at the
		  southern tip of the delta, transfer several trillion gallons of water from
		  the delta annually, and are powerful enough that, when operating at capacity,
		  they have the effect of reversing the normal flow of water in the delta.</p>
		<p>The delta is also the only habitat for the Delta Smelt. Once the estuary&#8217;s
		  most abundant species, it is now on the brink of extinction. In 1993, the
		  two inch long blue-green fish, which smells like cucumber, was declared endangered
		  and subject to the protection of both the California and Federal Endangered
		  Species Acts. The smelt&#8217;s short life span and need for both brackish
		  and fresh water habitat make it an environmentally sensitive species. It
		  is widely believed that the smelt are a barometer for other sensitive species.
		  As the smelt go, so do other species, worry area scientists, environmentalists
		  and sport fishers.</p>
		<p>In 2005, California Department of Fish and Game declared that pumping fresh
		  water from the delta would not threaten the fish population. However, a coalition
		  of anglers, commercial fishermen, Indian Tribes, and environmental justice
		  advocates disagreed and pursued the matter through the courts, trying to
		  force the state to mitigate the impact of the pumps on the fish population.</p>
		<p>Federal District Court Judge Oliver Wanger, who mandated on May 25th, 2007
		  that the pumps be brought into compliance with the Endangered Species Acts,
		  agreed, expressing frustration with the government&#8217;s inability to manage
		  California&#8217;s water without putting fish at risk of extinction. In a
		  June 23, 2007 Oakland Tribune article, Judge Wanger made the enormity of
		  the problem clear, &#8220;What can we do to remedy that in a way that won&#8217;t
		  cause a whole swath of destruction? We have allowed the government to address
		  these issues and it simply hasn&#8217;t worked.&#8221;</p>
		<p>Some characterized California&#8217;s reluctance to act as being in a state
		  of denial, while others expressed uncertainty that these efforts would ensure
		  the smelts&#8217; survival.</p>
		<p>On May 31st, the state Department of Water Resources took the dramatic step
		  of shutting down the delta pumps. Originally, the shutdown was to last 7-9
		  days, but ended up lasting almost three weeks. Disappointed by the drastic
		  action, Assemblywoman Nicole Parra issued a press release on June 14th, in
		  which she said, &#8220;The magnitude of a continued shut down or severely
		  curtailed operations should not be underestimated. The curtailed delivery
		  of water&#8230; would have significant impacts upon the Central Valley, the
		  state&#8217;s overall economy, and food supply and costs across the nation.
		  Farmers and ranchers render decisions months in advance about what crops
		  to plant and grow. They engage in such decision-making by knowing that a
		  water source will be available and when that water will be available.&#8221;</p>
		<p>In a June 14th editorial in The Fish Sniffer, Bill Jennings, chairman of
		  the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance, clarified the &#8220;battle
		  to save the Delta smelt is not a fish versus people issue. It&#8217;s a case
		  of fish and the West Coast&#8217;s biggest and most important ecosystem versus
		  subsidized crops. We may be witnessing the first ever extinction of a species
		  deliberately caused by the Bureau of Reclamation and Department of Water
		  Resources.&#8221;</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 8</strong></p>
		<p>Heroin and cocaine addiction are rampant in the United States. It is estimated
		  that there are three million cocaine users in the United States, and one
		  million habitual heroin users. Heroin use is rapidly overtaking cocaine use,
		  as poppies are easier to grow than cocaine, and opium is easier to smuggle
		  and is more profitable than cocaine. Most of the opium that finds its way
		  to the United States comes from Colombia or Mexico, while Afghanistan supplies
		  most the European drug market. Even so, Afghanistan's opium trade significantly
		  impacts the United States.</p>
		<p>In accordance with Islamic law, the Taliban in Afghanistan initially fought
		  the opium trade. The Taliban reversed its stance in recent years, and now
		  protects and taxes Afghanistan&#8217;s opium business, using drug profits
		  to support its activities. Some success in eradicating opium poppies has
		  been achieved by paying farmers to plant legal agricultural crops instead
		  of poppies, but this is not a great incentive. An acre of poppies produces
		  up to 500 times the income of agricultural products. Despite a $420 million
		  effort by the US government in 2006 to eradicate Afghanistan's opium trade
		  by plowing poppy plants under or trampling them underfoot, the 2006 Afghanistan
		  poppy harvest surpassed the previous year&#8217;s record crop, producing
		  a heroin supply so abundant that it exceeded the demand of the world&#8217;s
		  addicts. The use of mycoherbicides offers another option that could be used
		  to eradicate illegal drug crops.</p>
		<p>Mycoherbicides are living organisms that invade plants, introducing a toxin
		  that sometimes kills the plant; or if the plant lives until harvest, the
		  toxin may cause illness and death when ingested by humans or animals. Farmers
		  and foreign government leaders oppose defoliation, claiming that along with
		  destroying drug crops, spraying harms people, destroys legitimate agricultural
		  crops, pollutes waterways, and is detrimental to livestock and other animals.
		  Every United States government agency that has studied mycoherbicides has
		  concluded the organisms are pernicious, can be genetically unstable and mutate
		  rapidly, and may have a disastrous impact on the environment. Although international
		  consensus on the danger of mycoherbicides is lacking, many countries consider
		  their use to be a form of biological warfare. Experiments have been conducted
		  to extract and intensify mycoherbicide toxins for this use.</p>
		<p>The United States House of Representative has twice passed Resolution 2829,
		  the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act, although
		  both times the legislation stalled in the Senate. One of the act&#8217;s
		  provisions requires &quot;a plan to conduct, on an expedited basis, a scientific
		  study of the use of mycoherbicide as a means of illicit drug crop elimination...in
		  a major drug producing nation&#8221; (HR 2829, Section 6n). In the past,
		  the United States has tied foreign aid money to mycoherbicide spraying.		  </p>
    <p><strong>CASE 9</strong></p>
		<p>Every day, 110 people join the list of people in the United States waiting
		  for organs. They increasingly seek live donors for livers and kidneys, as
		  there are not nearly enough donations from deceased donors to meet the skyrocketing
		  demand for organs. To the relief of individuals waiting for organs, many
		  are finding donors among the living. Nearly half of those who donated organs
		  in the United States in 2004 were living donors.</p>
		<p>When her niece Patty needed a liver transplant, Brigid Higgins figured that
		  she was the right person to volunteer to be a live donor: she was 32, healthy,
		  childless, and had the summer free from teaching duties to recover. Patty&#8217;s
		  sister, Molly, also offered to be a donor, but because Molly was still a
		  teen-ager, everyone agreed that Brigid&#8217;s maturity made her a more appropriate
		  choice.</p>
		<p>Brigid wasn&#8217;t released from the hospital when expected, however, as
		  she continued to experience complications following surgery. Nearly a month
		  after donating part of her liver to Patty, Brigid was feverish, vomiting,
		  in intense pain, and suffering from multiple infections. Her liver, lungs,
		  and kidneys no longer worked properly.</p>
		<p>Only after the donation did Brigid realize that she had not been fully informed
		  of the risks of live donation, primarily because that information is just
		  not available. Every transplant recipient is tracked over the long-term.
		  People waiting for organs can find a myriad of data on complications, survival
		  rates, and morbidity and mortality risks. This is not the case for donors.
		  In contrast to the situation for organ recipients, no money is included in
		  the federal health budget to track outcomes for all donors. The medical community
		  doesn&#8217;t know how big a risk living donors face, and appears to have
		  little interest in longitudinal studies of organ donors. Because of the resulting
		  lack of information, no one knows how many donors have suffered complications
		  or have died because of their donation.</p>
		<p>&#8220;I felt prepared, &#8220; said Brigid. &#8220;I asked so many questions,
		  except the ones I should have asked: &#8216;What evidence is there of long-term
		  consequences and adverse outcomes for living donors, and how reliable and
		  extensive are these data?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
		<p>More distressing to Brigid than the impossibility of informed consent &#8211; the
		  desire to help Patty was so strong that, even knowing the risks, she would
		  have accepted them to save her niece&#8217;s life - was learning that there
		  is no uniform process for deciding who is an appropriate donor. The elderly,
		  minors, and even the psychologically fragile, may act as living organ donors,
		  and because they may be overly trusting, not able to appreciate fully the
		  potential risks, not know what questions to ask, be easily coerced, or think
		  it is impossible for anything to go wrong, they are particularly vulnerable.
		  It deeply troubled Brigid every time she reflected that it might have been
		  Molly going through the medical nightmare she was now experiencing. Brigid
		  also felt isolated, unable to discuss her medical problems with her family.
		  The last thing she wanted was to diminish their joy over Patty&#8217;s successful
		  transplant by giving anyone the impression that she regretted her donation.</p>
		<p>The National Organ Act of 1984 does not address specifics of living donation.
		  Many transplant surgeons oppose instituting formalized guidelines on the
		  grounds that organ transplantation is still a developing field where progress
		  is made by doing the seemingly impossible, and imposing formalized standards
		  would impede progress and cost lives. Although the Health Resources and Services
		  Administration (the federal agency charged with organ transplants oversight)
		  could regulate the system, it often defers to the recommendations of institutions
		  and professional groups.</p>
		<p>Advocates for living donors are concerned that the transplant system revolves
		  around recipients to the detriment of live donors. Because patients waiting
		  for organs are very ill, often near death, the transplant team gets to know
		  them better, and invests more in their care. The success rates of transplant
		  surgeons reflect outcomes of organ recipients; the rates don&#8217;t consider
		  donor outcomes. Consequently, advocates fear that the doctor-recipient relationship
		  takes precedence over the doctor-donor relationship. This imbalance may be
		  exacerbated as the recipients&#8217; insurance pays the bills. All of this
		  may lead some doctors to advocate, unaware, for the welfare of the recipient
		  over that of the donor.</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 10</strong></p>
		<p>Employers, government, and insurance companies have tried various techniques
		  to control health care costs and to improve quality of care, including pay-for-performance
		  (dubbed P4P for short). Under P4P for doctors, physicians are paid more if
		  their performance measures up to some preset benchmarks, or less if it fails
		  to meet the standard. Physicians may get a year end bonus (or financial penalty
		  if they fail to meet objectives) if they, for example, document that 75%
		  of female patients received mammograms; use electronic medical records; see
		  a set number of patients per day; order 10% fewer MRI&#8217;s; or if their
		  diabetic patients make 20% fewer visits to the emergency room. Few good scientific
		  studies have been conducted to discover if P4P actually does increase quality.</p>
		<p>Payer frustration, spiraling costs, and little progress in improving outcomes
		  or decreasing medical errors, have made quality and cost top health care
		  priorities. Proponents of pay-for-performance medicine point to the well-respected
		  financial reward for corporate executives whose companies do well. In recent
		  years, a variety of quality control measures have been unsuccessful in overcoming
		  the lack of incentives in American health care for quality and cost control.
		  Payments to US doctors and hospitals, traditionally based on provider costs,
		  provided few incentives to improve quality and efficiency. Although the US
		  spent $2 trillion on health care in 2005, over 40 million Americans do not
		  have health insurance.</p>
		<p>Experts disagree on whether the standards should be actual outcomes of care
		  (did the patient get better, survive, etc.) or a list of processes to be
		  followed. Critics and supporters alike ask who should determine criteria
		  and whether performance should be publicly reported. Employers, health plans,
		  quality organizations, physician group practices, and the government currently
		  sponsor over 100 very different P4P schemes, with nearly that many sets of
		  criteria for determining performance quality. All agree that data collection
		  and processing is expensive and that adequate programs for analysis are not
		  yet available. Where should the funds to pay provider bonuses come from?
		  Medicare and Medicaid and private insurance companies insist that they must
		  come from existing funds (to avoid tax or premium increases), but this prospect
		  leads to concern that all of health care will be negatively affected if regular
		  payment to physicians is cut back to fund P4P.</p>
		<p>Critics of P4P fear that doctors may be forced to pit their own financial
		  well-being against what is medically best for the patient. Clearly some criteria
		  (increased screening, immunization, education) could improve care for patients.
		  However, other criteria might have the opposite effect (limiting services,
		  seeing more patients), even while they decrease system cost and increase
		  efficiency. Doctors may avoid patients who threaten their &#8216;performance&#8217; (e.g.,
		  non-compliant, non-paying, or medically complex patients) thereby limiting
		  access to care. If diabetic patients&#8217; emergency room visits depress
		  performance scores, doctors might decide not to treat diabetic patients.
		  The doctor-patient relationship may be affected if patients know treatment
		  decisions may impact doctor compensation adversely. Keeping a bonus in mind,
		  will the doctor decide the MRI is unneeded?</p>
		<p>In some plans, the incentive is not just a bonus (about which patients might
		  never know) but also involves a public reporting of the doctor&#8217;s performance
		  score. One plan noted in its network list which doctors had received good
		  performance scores, in this case based to a great extent on practice efficiency.
		  In addition to raising concerns about fairness, accuracy, and objectivity,
		  this practice can adversely affect performance scores that don&#8217;t take
		  into account the complexities of individual cases. For example, the performance
		  outcomes of a hospital that specializes in difficult pregnancies and neonatal
		  medicine may have a much higher rate of complications and mortality, despite
		  extremely competent medical care, because the patients present with complicating
		  conditions.<br>
		  In an article in American Medical News, Dr. Edmund Blum, an internist
		  from Brooklyn, argues that P4P &#8220;involves an &#8216;irresolvable conflict&#8217; with
		  the ethical standards of the medical profession.&#8221; He quotes Dr. Faith
		  Fitzgerald who said,&quot; We must not servilely accept gratuities for doing
		  our duty.&quot;</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 11</strong></p>
		<p>Dr. Lyle Johnson&#8217;s last patient left at 6:30PM but he had to call
		  several others before he could lock up his office and go home. In the sixteen
		  years he had been out of medical school, practicing medicine had changed
		  from being fulfilling to feeling like drudgery. Insurance reimbursement for
		  seeing his family practice patients had changed so that he needed to spend
		  more hours working, and to see more patients to maintain his income. He hated
		  keeping his eye on the clock, discouraging long conversations with patients,
		  and, most particularly, missing time with his family. He loved being a doctor
		  but thought it was telling that he found himself envying older colleagues
		  who took early retirement.</p>
		<p>As he drove home, hoping to get there in time to see his daughter off on
		  her first date, he contemplated a possible change in his life. For some time
		  he had been considering converting to what is called a &#8216;boutique&#8217; or &#8216;concierge&#8217; practice.
		  He had read extensively about these arrangements whereby the practice is
		  comprised of a very small number of patients who pay the physician a monthly
		  or annual retainer. In exchange for this &#8216;membership&#8217; fee, the
		  patients are guaranteed same-day or next-day appointments, easy access to
		  the doctor (by phone, email, pager), ample and flexible appointment times,
		  and other amenities that might include newsletters, wellness programs, home
		  visits, physicals, etc. Some physicians he read about had completely opted
		  out of dealing with any health insurance and charged very large annual fees
		  ($20,000) to provide all services to their patients. Lyle was not comfortable
		  with that arrangement, feeling it would surely be too expensive for many
		  of his current patients. He also felt it would be less risky for him to allow
		  insurance to cover services delivered and simply charge a $1000-$1500 annual
		  fee that would make up for what he would lose by seeing far fewer patients.</p>
		<p>Lyle found himself smiling at the prospect of being able to have lengthy
		  discussions with patients, getting to know them again and understanding the
		  context of their medical problems. On the other hand, several issues kept
		  nagging at him. He did not worry about being able to have sufficient patients
		  since the majority of his patients were modestly wealthy. He fretted, however,
		  about whether he could feel right about forcing patients who could not afford
		  the fee to find another physician, even if he helped them find another doctor.
		  He felt some moral obligation to serve at least some of the many indigent
		  patients in his community. Although a report from the AMA&#8217;s counsel
		  concluded that retainer medicine was unlikely to become a very large phenomenon,
		  Lyle still worried about critics&#8217; predictions that if many physicians
		  followed this route, America would end up with a two-tiered medical system:
		  one for the rich, and one for the poor. Lyle had grown up in a family with
		  a strong sense of social responsibility and lived this value in his work
		  and life. He had a vague sense of unease with the idea that he would be charging
		  patients more to get the kind of medical service everyone deserved.</p>
		<p>Lyle had studied guidelines for such practices outlined by the AMA Council
		  on Ethical and Judicial Affairs and he felt he could abide by them.</p>
		<p>Turning onto his street, he saw his daughter riding away with her date.
		  He vowed to talk to his wife about making this change.</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 12</strong></p>
		<p>Shi Tao, 37, was a journalist and the head of the news division at the Dangdai
		  Shangbao (Contemporary Business News) in Changsha, Hunan Province, prior
		  to his arrest. Shi had also written essays for overseas Internet forums.
		  In an essay posted in April 2004, entitled &quot;The Most Disgusting Day,&quot; Shi
		  criticized the government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) for
		  the detention the previous month of Ding Zilin, an activist for the Tiananmen
		  Mothers, whose 17-year-old son was killed during the June 1989 crackdown
		  of the democracy movement.</p>
		<p>On 20 April 2004, Shi attended a staff meeting at the Contemporary Business
		  News where the contents of a Chinese Communist Party Central Propaganda Bureau
		  document about security concerns and preparation for the upcoming 15th anniversary
		  of the crackdown were discussed. That evening, from his office, Shi used
		  his personal Yahoo! email account to send his notes about this meeting to
		  the New York-based website Democracy Forum.</p>
		<p>Shi was detained that November, and tried under Article 111 of the PRC Criminal
		  Law for &quot;illegally providing state secrets overseas&quot; the previous
		  April. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment; his appeal was denied a
		  few weeks later.</p>
		<p>Reporters Without Borders, an international media watchdog group, said Yahoo!&#8217;s
		  Hong Kong office helped China link Shi Tao's e-mail account and computer
		  to a message containing the information. Reporters Without Borders accused
		  Yahoo! of becoming a police informant to further its business ambitions.</p>
		<p>Yahoo! is hardly alone among Western technology firms hit with bad publicity
		  for their complicity in aiding China&#8217;s curtailment of individual liberties
		  and human rights. Google recently revealed that it was entering the Chinese
		  market with a censored search product, tweaked according to government specifications.
		  Microsoft announced new policies that would enable it to honor the Chinese
		  government&#8217;s demand to shut down a citizen&#8217;s blog within China
		  while still keeping the blog visible outside of China.</p>
		<p>As reported in the February 6, 2006 New York Times, Bill Gates took another
		  tack at a Microsoft-sponsored conference in Lisbon, claiming, &#8220;the
		  ability to really withhold information no longer exists.&#8221; In other
		  words, Microsoft may agree to censor or filter some content, but, in the
		  end, censorship is no match for human ingenuity and the endless ways for
		  the Internet to provide workarounds. &#8220;You may be able to take a very
		  visible Web site and say that something shouldn&#8217;t be there,&quot; Mr.
		  Gates said, &#8220;but if there is a desire by the population to know something,
		  it is going to get out.&#8221;</p>
		<p>At an upcoming hearing by the House subcommittee on Global Human Rights,
		  observers expect executives from Cisco, Yahoo!, Google and Microsoft to claim
		  that they must abide by the laws of the countries in which they operate,
		  maintain that practical considerations preclude them from imposing American
		  values regarding censorship on business relation ships in China, and assert
		  that if American Internet companies don&#8217;t do business in China, change
		  will never come there. What cost change?</p>
		<p><strong>CASE 13</strong></p>
		<p>In May 2007, Google unveiled its latest offering in the map category: Google
		  Street View. Google Street View is street-level photographic mapping, currently
		  available for certain cities. When first announced, only five cities were
		  included (Denver, Las Vegas, Miami, New York City, and San Francisco), but
		  within half a year the number of cities increased to fifteen. The images,
		  while not real-time, capture the look of a city. Google users anywhere in
		  the world can take their own virtual tours down the same streets and see
		  the same sights.</p>
		<p>To prepare a map section for Street View, a specially equipped car drove
		  up and down streets, taking 360-degree pictures of whatever happened to be
		  there at the time. It captured panoramic, photographic imagery from specific
		  streets within selected cities. Later, using Street View, someone can drop
		  down to just above eye level and ride virtually through the streets, zooming
		  in on buildings, faces, cars, and other sights of interest.</p>
		<p>The images are stitched together, so that the representations of buildings,
		  and occasionally of cars or of people, are distorted in odd and sometimes
		  amusing ways. Numerous web sites have sprung up to display funny or interesting
		  images &#8220;scraped&#8221; from street view. One image shows a man breaking
		  into an apartment. Another is of a man urinating on the side of the road.
		  Hit-and-run accidents, drug deals, groping, nose-picking, sunbathing, you
		  name it, whatever people do on or near the street when they think no one
		  is looking can be found on the Internet.</p>
		<p>Predictably, some people have been upset to find themselves displayed in
		  awkward, funny, or embarrassing positions. Some parents are not at all happy
		  to have pictures of their children standing on street corners. Some authorities
		  in New York have expressed concern about images from inside various tunnels.
		  One woman was unnerved to see her house on Street View with her favorite
		  cat sitting in the front window. In fact, sometimes the images are so clear
		  that faces are easily identified, license plates are clearly visible, and
		  the interiors of some houses and stores can be seen. Some websites solicit
		  sightings of attractive women.</p>
		<p>Google has taken several steps, both anticipating and responding to privacy
		  concerns. Before the release of images for a city, Google contacts women&#8217;s
		  shelters and drug rehabilitation centers and removes images from their maps.
		  While in Street View, users can click on &#8220;Street View Help,&#8221; and
		  find instructions on how to report an inappropriate image. Those caught on
		  camera may request to have their images reviewed and removed or obscured
		  from Street View.</p>
		<p>But many privacy advocates say this is not enough. They insist that Google
		  should obscure the faces and license plates of everyone on Street View, and
		  not require people to ask Google to obscure their images. To have an image
		  removed, one has to see it first, by which time many others have seen it
		  as well. The process is cumbersome and time-consuming, as Google's proposed
		  solution requires people to search through all the available video footage
		  to see if their pictures are visible or if the images infringe their privacy.
		  It's not simply a matter of searching for a name, as people&#8217;s images
		  are anonymous: the database is not readily searchable. Furthermore, the removal
		  process is not automatic. The image must first be reviewed, and even then
		  Google does not guarantee that it will be removed.</p>

	    <strong>CASE 14</strong></p>
		<p>In September of 2006, James Kirby started a company, Redux Beverages, to
		  manufacture and distribute a caffeinated energy drink called &quot;Cocaine.&quot; Redux
		  advertised Cocaine as &quot;A legal alternative&#8221; and their advertisements
		  played up on the name. Phrases like &quot;Speed in a Can,&quot; &quot;Liquid
		  Cocaine,&quot; and &quot;Cocaine--Instant Rush&quot; appeared in their advertisements.
		  In fact, the drink contained no cocaine (drug) or any other illegal substance,
		  but was just a highly caffeinated soft drink. One 8.2 oz. can contained 280
		  mg of caffeine, roughly the caffeine in two cups of coffee.</p>
		<p>As one might expect, a controversy developed almost immediately. A councilman
		  from Queens, New York, tried to organize a boycott of the product, claiming
		  that the manufacturer was either ignorant of the tragedy of addiction, or
		  indifferent to the value of human life compared with the value of money.
		  Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York strongly criticized Redux Beverages for
		  glorifying a product that capitalizes on a destructive narcotic, given the
		  extensive problem of drug abuse and addiction. In reply to his critics, Kirby
		  said that he chose the name because controversy sells, rebelliousness is
		  appealing, and the wordplay is ironic fun. He credited consumers with being
		  able to distinguish between an energy drink and an addictive drug. Kirby
		  reportedly denied that his drink would encourage drug use, but did not deny
		  that the drug might encourage consumption of his drink. Sales increased rapidly.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Michael H. Davis, a professor at Cleveland State University's
		  College of Law needed an extracurricular project for students in his Copyright,
		  Patent, and Trademark class. After a class discussion of trademarks that
		  could be refused for being ''immoral or scandalous,&quot; someone mentioned
		  the new drink and Davis soon found five student volunteers to file a trademark
		  opposition against Redux in his name. In their filing, made on October 10,
		  2006, the students also represented the nonprofit organizations Americans
		  for Drug Free Youth and the Progressive Intellectual Property Law Association.
		  Their filing opposed the trademark for the name, &quot;Cocaine,&quot; on
		  the grounds that it was 'immoral and scandalous,&quot; and furthermore it
		  was &quot;deceptively misdescriptive&quot; since the drink did not in fact
		  contain the drug cocaine.</p>
		<p>As a result of the students' filing, the trademark examining attorney, Michael
		  Engel, who had tentatively approved the application for federal trademark,
		  changed his mind and asked for a remand for refusal. On Dec. 6, the United
		  States Patent and Trademark Office turned down Redux's application for the
		  trademarked name, &quot;Cocaine.&quot;</p>
		<p>The New York Times (December 18, 2006) quoted Professor Davis as saying, &quot;My
		  interest was just the legal interest, to get some experience for the students.''
		  He added that they were &quot;far more anti-drug than I'd expected.''</p>
		<p>In May 2007, Redux pulled Cocaine from the market and initially announced
		  they were changing the name to &quot;Censored.&quot; Redux settled on &quot;No
		  Name,&quot; as a temporary measure. At the time of the writing of this case,
		  the product contained a blank space where the name should appear with the
		  instructions, &quot;Insert Name Here.&quot; Kirby explained the name change
		  as an opportunity to promote the brand's fun spirit and empower consumers
		  to call the drink whatever they like. As an aid to customers, store displays
		  contain stickers with suggested names they can put on the can, including, &quot;Banned-by-the-man,&quot; &quot;Screwed,&quot; and &quot;Censored.&quot;</p>
		<p>According to the company's official website, &quot;In the coming year we're
		  going to release a few new surprises to the market.... So stay tuned. This
		  party's just getting started.&quot;</p>
	  <p><strong>CASE 15</strong></p>
		<p>Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription drugs through mass
		  media such as newspapers and magazines, radio and television, the Internet,
		  and billboards has increased dramatically since 1997 when the U.S. Food and
		  Drug Administration (FDA) loosened its policies. Since then, prescription
		  drug advertising has been one of the fastest-growing portions of healthcare
		  spending in the United States.</p>
		<p>This advertising is not without controversy, however. In fact, it is legal
		  in only two developed countries: the United States and New Zealand. Gary
		  Ruskin, Executive Director of Commercial Alert, testifying at a November
		  2005 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hearing on DTC advertising,
		  said, &#8220;Pharmaceutical companies have conflicts-of-interest that keep
		  them from presenting unbiased information about their products&#8221; because
		  their first obligation is to make money for their stockholders. The FDA does
		  impose rules on advertising content. Most people have seen the required pages
		  of information that accompany print ads. These are presented in very small
		  font, written in medical jargon requiring a college level of reading ability
		  for comprehension (about 25% of Americans have a college degree), and represent
		  the advertised drug as the only treatment option. Broadcast media are relieved
		  from including such extensive information by FDA rules that are more lenient.</p>
		<p>Scott Lassman of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of American
		  (PhRMA) testified, at the same FDA hearings, that ads result in better-educated
		  patients and increased compliance. Drug companies point to studies confirming
		  that advertisements raise awareness about certain underdiagnosed conditions,
		  such as depression, resulting in earlier discussions with physicians as well
		  as earlier diagnosis and treatment.</p>
		<p>Supporters of DTC advertising suggest that, in light of the increasing impersonality
		  of medical care and the limits on time doctors can spend with patients, informed
		  consumers are at an advantage and can take more personal responsibility for
		  their care.</p>
		<p>Some doctors welcome the increased participation and knowledge their patients
		  have, but virtually all dislike the pressure to prescribe at all or to prescribe
		  a particular drug. Physicians report that consumers have unreasonable expectations
		  of advertised drugs, focusing on the benefits without knowledge of the risks
		  and alternatives. Many physicians resent the intrusion into the doctor-patient
		  relationship and the questioning of their advice. Little empirical research
		  has documented that communication is better or that health outcomes are improved
		  as a result of ads. Doctors also report that many consumers assume incorrectly
		  that ads have been approved by a government agency and must be truthful.</p>
		<p>Critics decry the &#8216;medicalization&#8217; of many conditions like obesity
		  or normal aging (that might be better resolved by lifestyle changes) and
		  the creation of false hope that there is a drug for every situation. Use
		  of emotional images, actor &#8216;doctors,&#8217; celebrities, and fear techniques
		  are not educational, according to detractors. Considered especially noxious
		  is advertising to adolescents (weight reduction remedies, acne medication,
		  etc.).</p>
		<p>Without doubt, advertising increases demand. The Kaiser Family Fund (KFF)
		  reports that a 10% increase in DTC advertising spending results in a 1% increase
		  in sales for the class of drug (not necessarily for the specific drug advertised).
		  KFF studies also found that doctors write prescriptions more for the most
		  heavily advertised drugs, though exact cause-and-effect relationship has
		  not been established, because marketing to physicians is usually increased
		  concurrently. The KFF also determined that for every $1 spent on DTC advertising
		  in 2000, sales increased by $4.20. Studies indicate that the ads encourage
		  switching from older, cheaper drugs to newer, more expensive options that
		  may be less well established in regard to efficacy and risks. The latter
		  effect causes insurers and policy makers to worry about &#8216;demand pull&#8217; that
		  undermines cost control and utilization limits.</p>
		<p>In 1998, the American College of Physicians supported DTC advertising in
		  principle, but recognized the need for careful regulation to assure accuracy.
		  The American Medical Association issued guidelines for DTC advertising, and
		  in 2006 the House of Delegates called for a moratorium on advertising new
		  drugs so doctors would have time to learn about a drug before their patients
		  ask for it. Expressing general support for DTC advertising, the American
		  Pharmaceutical Association called for enforcement of regulations and suggested
		  that pharmacists receive pre-release knowledge of ads.<br>
