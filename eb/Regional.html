		<p>
		  In the fall of 2009 ten regional ethics bowls will take place throughout
		    the United States. In February 2010, the top scoring teams in the ten regional
		    ethics bowls (32 total) will compete at the national championship of the
		    IEB in Cincinnati, Ohio at the nineteenth Annual Meeting of the Association
		    for Practical and Professional Ethics (APPE). For information about the

		  <p><strong>Case #1: Sexting</strong></p>
		  <p>The exchange of racy images between consenting adults is a phenomenon
		    that has exploded with recent technological advances. Pornography is one
		    of the Internet&#8217;s major revenue generating mechanisms and many people
		    report receiving unsolicited emails for pornographic websites. Users have
		    found ways to transmit pornography with other technology, including text
		    messages sent via cellular phone. A recent survey of 1200 teenagers revealed
		    that one in five had used their cell phone to send &#8220;sexy or nude
		    photos of themselves,&#8221; or sexts. </p>
		  <p>Sexting can be as simple as a person sending a provocative image to his
		    partner to inspire a wry grin. The issue has become prominent in part because
		    the couple just described might be children, and the image might be extremely
		    provocative. In one case a 17-year-old girl used her cell phone to send
		    nude photos of herself to her boyfriend. After the two broke up, however,
		    the photos began circulating among the other students at their high school.
		    In one such case, the teen committed suicide. While sexting may facilitate
		    easier transmission of these types of images, some contend that new messaging
		    technology is just a new medium for old behaviors.</p>
		  <p>Beyond the possible embarrassment of circulating nude photographs, teenagers
		    across the U.S. have been charged with obscenity for owning, producing,
		    and distributing sexts. Since sexters are often under the legal age of
		    consent, some prosecutors have even chosen to punish sexting as child pornography.
		    If convicted, such charges come with serious consequences, such as hefty
		    fines, jail time, and the stigma of the sex offender label. On one hand,
		    such punishment may serve as a strong deterrent, reducing the number of
		    sexts sent by impulsive teens.</p>
		  <p>On the other hand, in at least one case, the ACLU has sought to protect
		    the speech rights of minors and to prevent criminal prosecution for sexting.
		    According to the ACLU&#8217;s Witold Walczak, &quot;Kids should be taught
		    that sharing digitized images of themselves in embarrassing or compromised
		    positions can have bad consequences, but prosecutors should not be using
		    heavy artillery like child-pornography charges to teach them that lesson.&quot; Some
		    legislators agree and sex crimes laws have been changed in some jurisdictions
		    to either allow for consensual sharing of sexual materials between minors,
		    or to reduce the penalties for such behavior.</p>
		  <p> </p>
		  <p><strong>Case #2: Testing Junior</strong></p>
		  <p>The New York Times recently reported on several scientists who have applied
		    their craft to members of their own families, researching their own children.
		    Some used MRI scans on their children, some recorded their children&#8217;s
		    every word, and others merely parlayed their scientific knowledge and parental
		    observations into ideas for future use in controlled studies. Three scientists &#8211; Dr.
		    Arthur Toga, Dr. Deb Roy, and Dr. Deborah Linebarger discussed their research
		    on their children and their views on the impact of such research. These
		    researchers drew different lines with how they studied their children,
		    though all expressed concern for the privacy and wellbeing of their children
		    in the research process.</p>
		  <p>Dr. Toga allowed his children to participate in a longitudinal MRI study
		    which aimed at outlining the maturational stages of brain development across
		    many children. His children volunteered for the research on their own volition,
		    and the results were rendered anonymously. Dr. Linebarger both observed
		    and tested her four children, though primarily only in pilot studies. And
		    Dr. Roy recorded over 250,000 hours of his son&#8217;s life, focusing on
		    his son&#8217;s early language acquisition &#8211; his son was his first
		    and only subject in the early stages of his research. His students now
		    process small segments of the recordings of his son, and his research is
		    being parlayed into much larger studies of children with autism.</p>
		  <p>All of these scientist parents express the belief that, if anything, involving
		    their children in their research has strengthened their relationship with
		    their children, by allowing their children access to, and understanding
		    of, what mommy or daddy does for a living. However, such involvement does
		    come with some risks. Dr. Linebarger discussed how even pilot testing proved
		    difficult as a parent. When she tested her son five-year-old son, Dr. Linebarger
		    became interested in her son&#8217;s responses to some pilot questions
		    about parenting, and pursued the questions beyond the scope of the study.
		    After the fact, she realized that she would not have pursued that line
		    of questions with other subjects, and subsequently made a rule for her
		    studies: when piloting questions on her own children, she would not deviate
		    from the scripted questions except insofar as necessary to fix or improve
		    them.</p>
		  <p>Dr. Linebarger has also grappled with the issue of consent, and generally
		    asks her husband to sign parental consent forms prior to conducting research.
		    She additionally explains any studies she wishes to perform to her children,
		    and then asks them whether they are comfortable being studied. Dr. Linebarger
		    may not necessarily obtain her children&#8217;s consent for observational
		    studies for several reasons, though. First, such consent might interfere
		    with the natural actions that she seeks to observe. Second, the potential
		    harm from observation is so slight that she can feel comfortable providing
		    the consent for them. Ultimately, Dr. Linebarger notes that no matter what
		    sort of research she involves her children in, she would not involve her
		    children in actual, publishable studies due to the potential for bias and
		    diminished credibility.</p>
		  <p>Why engage one&#8217;s children in research at all? Several reasons motivate
		    Dr. Linebarger. First, she finds that her prior knowledge of her children,
		    their experiences and their capabilities, enriches her research &#8211; it
		    helps her to mold her methods and gauge her results. Second, she admits
		    that participants, particularly in longitudinal studies, may be difficult
		    to find, and by engaging her children in the pilot studies, she doesn&#8217;t
		    have to give up willing volunteers for the &#8220;real&#8221; study to
		    pilot tests.</p>
		  <p>Dr. Roy&#8217;s son is four years old now; he stopped recording his son
		    over a year ago and his focus now is to &#8220;analyze the recordings made
		    from ages 9-24 months.&#8221; Roy states that his son &#8220;is still far
		    too young to understand what &#8216;research&#8217; means, although he
		    does enjoy watching the occasional video clip.&#8221; While Dr. Roy believes
		    that his research has made him more attuned to his son&#8217;s language
		    skills, when asked, he states that he does not believe the research has
		    affected his relationship with his son in other ways.</p>
		  <p>This may be, in part, due to the strong precautions he enacted to ensure
		    his son&#8217;s privacy and wellbeing were protected. He states that he
		    and his wife had some reservations about the &#8220;possibility of the
		    recordings affecting their everyday lives in adverse ways,&#8221; and therefore &#8220;made
		    a number of provisions to provide [them] with complete control of when
		    recordings were made, multiple ways to delete recordings after the fact,
		    etc.&#8221;</p>
		  <p>Why not just test unrelated subjects? Dr. Roy believes studying his son
		    provided benefits and useful insights that he would not have obtained without
		    testing his own son. He states, &#8220;Due to the intimate nature of the
		    recordings, I was not willing to record someone else's children until I
		    knew that we had a properly worked out methodology not only for making
		    recordings but also privacy policies governing future access of the recordings.
		    As both subject of the study and investigator, I was able to reflect on
		    the effects of the recordings on myself and my family and make adjustments
		    to the method accordingly.&#8221;</p>
		  <p>He further relates, &#8220;With the methodology now relatively mature
		    and proven, we are extending our research to study children of other families
		    with a focus on understanding early stages of autism. We have new funding
		    from the National Institutes of Health and from an autism foundation to
		    pursue these directions in collaboration with other researchers and clinicians.
		    We do not plan to release the raw recordings to the public in order to
		    respect the privacy of my son and others that were recorded in the course
		    of the study.&#8221;</p>
		  <p>Dr. Toga, when interviewed by the New York Times, related how some nonscientists
		    chastised him for exposing his children to the risks of MRI scans. He notes,
		    however, that MRI scans really pose no risk &#8211; that they are comparable
		    to taking a photograph. When performing research, IRBs generally require
		    scientists to disclose very extensive information about every conceivable
		    risk to parents. Such a conservative approach might scare away less scientifically
		    versed parents. Dr. Toga admits that, given his strong understanding of
		    science, he believes that he might actually be more willing than the average
		    parent to have his children participate in scientific research. However,
		    he believes the minimal risks he would be willing to allow his children
		    to undertake during scientific testing vastly outweighed by the learning
		    they gain and their contribution to human knowledge (resulting from their
		    participation). He further notes that he might not have consented to more
		    risky procedures, such as PET scans.</p>
		  <p> </p>
		  <p><strong>Case #3: Christian Bashing?</strong></p>
		  <p>The founding fathers enacted the Bill of Rights to protect certain rights
		    against infringement by the government. The First Amendment enumerates
		    freedom of speech as one of the first protected rights, and deemed it essential
		    to the marketplace of ideas that fosters a healthy democratic process.
		    However, even politically charged speech may at times go too far, and constitute
		    impermissible hate speech. And that&#8217;s exactly the sort of speech
		    that supporters of George Washington University&#8217;s College Republicans
		    allege College Democrats submitted them to. </p>
		  <p>According to the school newspaper, &#8220;A number of crosses used by
		    the Young America&#8217;s Foundation [YAF] during an anti-abortion event
		    last week were defaced and left in [the office shared by both College Republicans
		    and Democrats]&#8230;.&#8221; Specifically, one was &#8220;draped with
		    a condom, another featured a drawing of Jesus along with the words &#8216;pwned&#8217; and &#8216;lol,&#8217; and
		    others were emblazoned with words like &#8216;Darwin,&#8217;&#8221; among
		    other writings.</p>
		  <p>College Democrats took responsibility for the action, and publicly apologized
		    for the actions of one of their members; furthermore, the student responsible, &#8220;face[d]
		    disciplinary action under the Code of Student Conduct.&#8221; University
		    Police took custody of the defaced property, and opened an investigation
		    into the incident, as well. The College Republicans released a public statement
		    condemning the acts, but their president did express appreciation at the
		    way the College Democrats handled the situation.</p>
		  <p>A student who witnessed the defaced crosses expressed a much stronger
		    reaction to the display, stating, &#8220;Apparently to the College Democrats,
		    making fun of Christianity, and specifically a memorial to aborted unborn
		    children is humor. To me, it is flagrant, disrespectful and downright disgusting.&#8221; In
		    a press release, President Steven Knapp stated, &quot;Such acts are unacceptable
		    and are utterly incompatible with the spirit of mutual respect that is
		    essential to the life of an academic community. I continue to hope and
		    expect that all our students, no matter what opinions they hold, will conduct
		    themselves in the spirit of mutual respect that has long been a hallmark
		    of this University.&quot; However, while this bad behavior may be offensive,
		    the exact nature of the act remains up for debate.</p>
		  <p>Some believe that the acts were childish, boorish, or just poor judgment
		    that justifies the normal penalties for the vandalism. Others argue that
		    the speech goes well beyond childishness &#8211; it constitutes desecration
		    of one group&#8217;s sacred images and religious symbols &#8211; and crosses
		    the line to constitute hate speech, which deserves a higher penalty than
		    an average act of vandalism.</p>
		  <p> </p>
		  <p><strong>Case #4: Testing Virtue</strong></p>
		  <p>Most people overestimate their ability to act on their principles, according
		    to a recent article in the New York Times. &#8220;In recent years, social
		    psychologists have begun to study what they call the holier-than-thou effect.
		    They have long known that people tend to be overly optimistic about their
		    own abilities and fortunes &#8211; to overestimate their standing in class,
		    their discipline, their sincerity. But this self-inflating bias may be
		    even stronger when it comes to moral judgment, and it can greatly influence
		    how people judge others&#8217; actions, and ultimately their own,&#8221; is
		    how Carey Benedict summed up the issue.</p>
		  <p>In the Good Samaritan experiment, even seminary students could not be
		    counted on to stop and help a stranger in need. In the experiment, Princeton
		    seminarians were asked to prepare a report on the parable of the Good Samaritan
		    in one building and report to another building to discuss the parable.
		    The seminarians were randomly assigned to one of three groups, those told
		    that they were running late, right on time, and a little early. While making
		    their way to the other building, each of the seminarians encountered a
		    man slumped on the sidewalk in obvious distress. Of the seminarians told
		    they were early, 63% stopped to help; those on time stopped 45% of the
		    time; and 10% of those running late helped. The researchers found that, &#8220;Ironically,
		    a person in a hurry is less likely to help people, even if he is going
		    to speak on the parable of the Good Samaritan. (Some literally stepped
		    over the victim on their way to the next building!) The results seem to
		    show that thinking about norms does not imply that one will act on them.&#8221;</p>
		  <p>The problem is how to develop empirical evidence that tests the credence
		    of self-righteous claims or that shows those who claim moral certitude
		    to be only deceiving themselves. Studies that best test individuals&#8217; actions
		    against their claims usually involve observing those individuals&#8217; actions
		    in manufactured situations where they are called on to act, but don&#8217;t
		    know that the morality of their actions is being measured. They might not
		    even know that they are the subjects of a research experiment. Critics
		    claim that there is something unethical about using deceptive means to
		    test the good character of others. For example, the University of Washington
		    medical school cautions its researchers, &#8220;As a general rule, deception
		    is not acceptable when doing research with humans. Using deception jeopardizes
		    the integrity of the informed consent process and can potentially harm
		    your participants.&#8221;</p>
		  <p>For instance, Stanley Milgram&#8217;s experiments on authority have been
		    roundly criticized as causing a potential crisis in the lives of test subjects.
		    However, one is forced to wonder if tests of virtue are being criticized
		    simply on the basis of the poor performance of test subjects. It is hard
		    to imagine any test gauging the relationship between moral attitudes and
		    actions which is not potentially harmful to participants. Research that
		    uncovers an uncomfortable but important truth&#8212;moral hypocrisy&#8212;is
		    likely to seem harmful to test subjects, but reveals important character
		    trends.</p>
		  <p> </p>
		  <p><strong>Case #5: Students&#8217; Little Helper</strong></p>
		  <p>Sara, a college junior, had watched others in her dorm pound their way
		    through all-night paper writing sessions, jobs, and parties with the help
		    of Ritalin, Adderall, and other drugs designed to keep them awake and focused.
		    Some of the students had been diagnosed with ADHD and had been on the drugs
		    for years. Others bought them at street prices from students who were happy
		    to share their prescriptions. Although an estimated 7% of students enrolled
		    in US universities have used cognitive enhancement drugs, with up to 25%
		    of students on some campuses reporting their use. Sara believed that true
		    success was the outcome of hard work and living a balanced life. She was
		    sure that no drug could substitute for that. Her grades, when compared
		    to those using the drugs, showed that her theory had merit. She had better
		    grades than anyone she knew who was using cognitive enhancement drugs.</p>
		  <p>But, now she had a dilemma. Sara was preparing for the LSAT and had always
		    had problems staying focused for those hours-long tests. Sara&#8217;s mother,
		    who was herself a lawyer, suggested that Sara talk to their family doctor
		    about a prescription for Provigil. Her mother used Provigil sparingly,
		    only when she was litigating tough cases and had to be sharp over long
		    hours in the courtroom. The doctor, who had known Sara all her life, wanted
		    to help Sara fulfill her lifelong dream of getting into a top law school
		    and knew that Sara had under-performed on standardized tests in the past.
		    Sara had the grades to get into a top school, but it was questionable if
		    she would have the LSAT scores that she needed. The doctor occasionally
		    did &#8220;off-label&#8221; prescribing of Provigil when she thought it
		    was appropriate. Sara left the doctor&#8217;s office with a prescription
		    for 4 100 mg tablets of Provigil, more than she would ever need, and with
		    reassurance that the drug, taken as prescribed, would not harm her.</p>
		  <p>Before going to her next LSAT prep course session, Sara took the drug.
		    She moved along through the practice test, feeling focused and confident. &#8220;This
		    is actually fun,&#8221; she thought and realized that she wasn&#8217;t
		    experiencing the fatigue that normally hit at the start of the third test
		    segment. Sara&#8217;s score was significantly higher than it had been on
		    past tests. She was ready for the LSAT.</p>
		  <p>That evening, she enthusiastically told two friends, Barbara and Nancy,
		    about her experience. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t using that drug cheating,&#8221; Barbara
		    wondered, &#8220;like athletes who use steroids?&#8221; She argued that
		    only enhancements available to everyone &#8211; like caffeine -- should
		    be allowed to be used. Nancy pointed out that not everyone could afford
		    to take a LSAT prep course, and maybe the cognitive enhancement drug offered
		    the same kind of boost. Nancy asked Sara if she could have one of the Provigil
		    tablets that Sara would not be using.</p>

		  <p><strong>Case #6: Parklife</strong></p>
		  <p>Desperate Kenyans, who, due to climate change, have seen a dramatic drop
		    in their food and water supplies, are settling illegally in their country&#8217;s
		    national parks. Around 15,000 squatters currently live throughout Kenya&#8217;s
		    protected parks. In order to make heavily forested areas apt for cultivation
		    and cattle-grazing, settlers have deforested almost 1 million acres.</p>
		  <p>Food insecurity has been the main cause behind these settlements, yet
		    the consequence of cutting down protected forests is to put Kenyan people
		    in an even more precarious situation. Because trees &#8220;promote the
		    formation of clouds &#8211; cutting them down inevitably leads to lower
		    rainfall.&#8221; In turn, lower rainfall adversely affects agriculture
		    and food security. The indiscriminate clearing of many of Africa&#8217;s
		    forests has already caused the desertification of the African landscape.
		    Mourning the recent disappearance of a local river, a Kenyan farmer worriedly
		    complained: &#8220;My life will be completely ruined if I cannot get water
		    for us and our livestock, our land will turn into a desert. We will all
		    die.&#8221;</p>
		  <p>Thus far, the Kenyan government has responded to the so-called assault
		    on its parks by vowing to add more armed guards and electric fences to
		    prevent illegal settlements. However, the situation in Kenya defies easy
		    solutions. While many squatters are hungry Kenyans in search of sustenance,
		    allowing the poor to extract resources out of nature parks will not solve
		    Kenya&#8217;s problems. As the director of Kenya&#8217;s Wildlife Service
		    has argued, &#8220;Kenya is destroying itself. The population has reached
		    an unsustainable level. We are killing ourselves slowly by destroying the
		    forests and settling there.&#8221; Complicating the issue still further,
		    many of the current settlers belong to indigenous groups who claim to have
		    lived in the forest for generations while allegedly harvesting its resources
		    in a sustainable manner. Furthermore, the label &#8220;squatters&#8221; has
		    even been called into question by those who claim to have land titles in
		    the protected areas.</p>
		  <p>Electric fencing might prevent additional settlements in Kenyan parks,
		    and the removal of current squatters may help prevent further destruction
		    of Kenya&#8217;s flora and fauna. However, these measures do little to
		    address the underlying cause of these illegal settlements: food scarcity
		    and climate change. It is unclear what the Kenya government can do to address
		    climate change, given that global warming can be partly attributed to developed
		    nations overuse of ecological resources. Because the lifestyle in developing
		    nations (in the form of copious carbon emissions) has unavoidably impacted
		    the whole earth, the negative consequences of global warming experienced
		    in the developing world constitute the &#8220;largest health inequity of
		    our time.&#8221;</p>

		  <p><strong>Case #7: MySpace Invasion</strong></p>
		  <p>Twenty-five-year-old Stacy Snyder, a senior at Millersville University
		    in Millersville, Pennsylvania, was dropped from the student-teaching portion
		    of her course work after the staff at the high school where she was student-teaching
		    viewed postings on her MySpace page. Already frustrated by what the high
		    school administration viewed as Stacy&#8217;s poor subject knowledge, her
		    weak grammar skills, and her overly informal attitude toward her students,
		    the high school staff decided, after viewing Stacy&#8217;s postings, that
		    she was not an acceptable candidate for a teaching degree. When Stacy could
		    not complete her required hours of student teaching because she was not
		    allowed on the high school grounds, the university decided to award her
		    a degree in English rather than the anticipated degree and certificate
		    in teaching.</p>
		  <p>The postings that the high school staff found inappropriate included a
		    photo of Stacy taken at a costume party. In the photo, Stacy is seen wearing
		    a pirate hat, drinking from a plastic cup; the photo caption reads: &#8220;A
		    Drunken Pirate.&#8221; Her MySpace page also included a posting that could
		    be interpreted as a negative comment about her supervising teacher at the
		    high school. Millersville University had warned the student-teachers earlier
		    that they should not post any comments about the high school staff on their
		    web pages, nor should they direct their students to personal web pages;
		    both directives Stacy ignored. In addition to showing general bad judgment
		    in posting questionable photos on MySpace, employers may generally dismiss
		    an employee for failure to follow workplace policies.</p>
		  <p>Ms. Snyder filed a federal law suit against the university, claiming violation
		    of her First Amendment rights. She sued for her degree in teaching and
		    the right to apply for a certificate.</p>
		  <p>Some states have enacted laws protecting employees from repercussions
		    of personal postings on the web, but Pennsylvania does not.</p>
		  <p>The federal judge ruled against Ms Snyder, stating that the university
		    is under no obligation to award the teaching degree without the required
		    hours of student teaching. The judge also stated that a teacher&#8217;s
		    First Amendment rights pertain to public matters only, not personal.</p>

		  <p><strong>Case #8: In the spirit of full disclosure</strong></p>
		  <p>On November 4, 2008, 52.3% of California voters approved Proposition 8 &#8211; also
		    known as the Marriage Protection Act. The proposition amended the state
		    constitution to bar same-sex couples from civil marriage. On May 26, 2009,
		    the California Supreme Court confirmed the legality of Prop 8, while at
		    the same time allowing same-sex couples who were married before November
		    5, 2009 to remain married. Although supporters of Prop 8 feel that so-called
		    traditional marriage has finally received its due protection, advocates
		    of same-sex marriage have decried the ratification of the voter initiative
		    as a gross violation of civil rights, akin to anti-miscegenation laws.</p>
		  <p>Backed by California&#8217;s campaign disclosure law, an anonymous individual
		    has put together the website www.eightmaps.com, which &#8220;takes the
		    names and ZIP codes of people who donated to the ballot measure [Prop 8]&#8230; and
		    overlays the data on a Google map.&#8221; Some of the individuals and companies
		    who donated money to outlaw same-sex marriage have received death threats,
		    and &#8220;their businesses have been boycotted.&#8221; In response to
		    this harassment, a group of Prop 8 supporters have filed a lawsuit attempting
		    to &#8220;to block their campaign finance records from public view.&#8221; Without
		    the protection of their personal information, some donors have indicated
		    that they would not contribute to similar causes, lest they receive further
		    harassment. This is exactly what critics of eightmaps.com fear: disclosure
		    laws, coupled with new technologies, such as Google maps, could discourage
		    voters from participating in the political process. As Michael Shin has
		    noted, websites disclosing donor information are not &#8220;explicitly
		    pernicious.&#8221; However, they can become a tool for violence and persecution.</p>
		  <p>According to Dr. Shin, a political scientist, transparency in the electoral
		    process promotes an informed electorate, thus &#8220;enhancing the quality
		    of democracy.&#8221; However, critics of eightmaps.com have noted that
		    the goal of transparency and disclosure laws is to expose powerful private
		    interests that are trying to influence the government &#8211; not private
		    citizens writing $100 checks to a political cause of their choice. While
		    transparency is necessary for an effective democracy, so too is privacy.
		    Political theorist Anabelle Lever has noted that privacy rights are not
		    merely instrumentally useful in protecting political participation, but
		    also necessary for the full exercise of personal freedom and equality.</p>
		  <p>On the other hand, eightmaps.com can enhance individuals&#8217; freedom
		    by allowing them to vote with their dollars. By boycotting Prop 8 donors,
		    supporters of equal rights for same-sex couples are, as many oppressed
		    minorities have done in the past, using soft power to bring about change.
		    As a No-on-8 activist put it, &#8220;a citizen has every right to donate
		    money to a cause that hurts me. And I have as much right to express my
		    disagreement by not patronizing their business.&#8221;</p>

		  <p><strong>Case #9: Imaginary Pundit</strong></p>
		  <p>Over the past 20 years, the Internet has become the ultimate vehicle to
		    accelerate the flow of relevant information. Around the world, the internet
		    is being utilized as a tool to self-educate faster than ever before. While
		    an immense library of knowledge on any subject is just a keystroke (or
		    Google search) away, there is a growing risk that some of this knowledge
		    is not credible. In many cases, authors create and package fiction with
		    the sole purpose of deceiving or manipulating the public into believing
		    things that are, in fact, false.</p>
		  <p>The 2008 U.S. presidential election has cast a spotlight on political
		    falsehoods created to appear as fact. A number of major news agencies have
		    fallen victim to fictitious information and quotes that were created in
		    an attempt to get air time and gain notoriety. Take the case of fictional
		    pundit, Martin (a.k.a. Michael) Eisenstadt. Sources ranging from Fox News
		    to Mother Jones, The New Republic, and the Los Angeles Times all fell prey
		    to Eisenstadt&#8217;s hoax.</p>
		  <p>The day after the 2008 presidential election, FOX News Channel reported
		    that an unnamed member of the McCain campaign stated, &#8220;Sarah Palin
		    did not know that Africa was a continent.&#8221; Following this story,
		    David Shuster, an MSNBC anchor, using information obtained from a blog,
		    attempted to set the record straight by reporting, &#8220;Turns out it
		    was Martin Eisenstadt, a McCain policy adviser, who has come forward to
		    identify himself as the source of the leaks.&#8221; While the truth of
		    the Palin-Africa claim remains uncertain, Mr. Eisenstadt, who claimed to
		    be the source, does not in fact exist &#8211; he is a fictional character
		    created by filmmakers Eitan Gorlin and Dan Mirvish; Gorlin plays Eisenstadt
		    in YouTube videos. Gorlin, via Eisenstadt, claimed responsibility for breaking
		    the story of Palin&#8217;s faux pas, but in truth he created the video
		    in response to the Fox News report, not before it. </p>
		  <p>Why did Eisenstadt perpetrate this fraud on the media? Gorlin states that
		    he and Mirvish started distributing the Eisenstadt pieces in order to get
		    a TV show. They changed Eisenstadt&#8217;s first name when bloggers and
		    journalists first noticed that Eisenstadt did not &#8220;check out,&#8221; and
		    later even went to the trouble of creating, &#8220;video footage, biography,
		    a false think tank Web site, and blog&#8221; for Eisenstadt to keep the
		    ruse up. Journalists do not have to operate in the dark or alone, however.
		    The website, sourcewatch.org provides some information on newsworthy (pseudo)
		    individuals like Eisenstadt to help journalists check backgrounds and verify
		    sources.Unfortunately, Time and CNN quoted Eisenstadt as a political pundit
		    again in May of 2009.</p>
		  <p> </p>
		  <p><strong>Case #10: Off the Field</strong></p>
		  <p>Michael Vick made headlines in 2007 when authorities discovered his involvement
		    in illegal dog-fighting. Through the legal proceedings, the public learned
		    that he had been a heavy hitter in the dog fighting world, engaging in
		    the purchase, training, abuse, and inhumane killing of many animals. He
		    pled guilty in August of 2007, and was released from prison in August of
		    2009.</p>
		  <p>As Vick reenters society and seeks to reenter the role of professional
		    football player, as well, many have called his character into question,
		    asking whether he ought to be allowed to continue his role as a famous
		    professional athlete.[44] Animal rights groups have expressed willingness
		    to accept the actions that Vick has taken since his conviction to educate
		    the public about the horrors of animal abuse, but also hold some reservations
		    about his reentry into the public spotlight. As stated in the New York
		    Times:</p>
		  <p>In May, the Humane Society broke ranks with other animal rights groups
		    by announcing a partnership with Vick&#8230;. The relationship between
		    Vick and the Humane Society is part of a well-manicured initiative that
		    benefits Vick as well as the organization. Vick uses the Humane Society
		    for validation. The society plans to use Vick to discuss the evils of dogfighting
		    and animal cruelty with young adults in urban areas.</p>
		  <p>While dog fighting is a horrific crime, resulting in terrible trauma to
		    its victims, dogs are not the only ones subject to harsh treatment, particularly
		    by NFL players. In 2000, Colts player, Steve Muhammed&#8217;s wife died,
		    and he faced charges of battery relating to her death. In 2004, Dolphin&#8217;s
		    tight end, Randy McMichael was arrested for hitting his pregnant wife.
		    These are not the only violent episodes against the families of NFL players,
		    but none has received as much press as Michael Vick&#8217;s involvement
		    in dog fighting. Some people, such as comedian Chris Rock, question why
		    people have become so outraged over Vick&#8217;s actions, and think that
		    the outrage may misunderstand the context in which the crime occurred.</p>
		  <p>Wayne Pacelle, the Humane Society&#8217;s president and CEO, recently
		    discussed the partnership with Vick, and stated, &#8220;Do I believe that
		    he cares about animals and wants to see dogfighting end? Yes&#8230;. In
		    terms of the depth of his passion, I&#8217;m not a mind reader, but I believe
		    he&#8217;s going to say the right things to kids and that he&#8217;s going
		    to stick with the program.&#8221;</p>
		  <p> </p>
		  <p><strong>Case #11: Women and Health Insurance</strong></p>
		  <p>Roughly 10% of Americans, including 6% of American women, who have health
		    insurance purchase that coverage as an individual, rather than through
		    an employer[50]. Premiums are generally higher than one would pay through
		    one&#8217;s employer, but one need not worry about losing the insurance
		    due to job loss.</p>
		  <p>According to a recent article in the New York Times, however, the deal
		    may be more costly if you don&#8217;t happen to be male. Women pay between
		    20% and 50% higher premiums than men for the same insurance coverage. (Employer-subsidized
		    insurance plans offer all employees the same benefit plan, regardless of
		    sex or gender.) Furthermore, women are charged more even if they decline
		    maternity coverage. Only ten states have passed laws prohibiting this kind
		    of discrimination in the individual insurance market, leaving the vast
		    majority of women unprotected on the open market.</p>
		  <p>Insurance companies argue that the higher cost for women is justified.
		    Women use more healthcare services than men, including a broad array of
		    services associated with maternity and reproductive health, and are thus
		    more expensive to insure. In this respect, the high premiums women pay
		    are like the higher premiums associated with age, despite one&#8217;s inability
		    to choose one&#8217;s sex or stop getting older. The higher premiums simply
		    reflect the higher expenses to the insurance company. Men and women seeking
		    insurance on the individual market can expect to pay more for a policy
		    if they have a pre-existing condition or other factors that cause them
		    to use more healthcare services. Women use more services in general, particularly
		    regular checkups and screenings, and unfortunately happen to be the only
		    demographic that can get pregnant.</p>
		  <p>Others claim that despite the business logic behind the higher premiums,
		    they are discriminatory. A significant wage gap already exists between
		    men and women who work similar jobs. To expect women to pay more on the
		    individual insurance market increases the wage gap even more. Charging
		    higher premiums based on racial or ethnic differences has been banned for
		    some time, despite the potential for differences in healthcare consumption
		    between races. These and other reasons fuel the contention that sex-based
		    insurance premium differences should be outlawed.</p>
		  <p>Of course purchasing insurance on the individual market is already expensive
		    for men, as well. Increasing their costs would introduce further disincentives
		    to buy insurance, potentially leading to fewer insured people altogether.
		    The concept of insurance implies that all of the people who pay premiums
		    subsidize others who use more than their &#8220;share&#8221; of medical
		    care, but the line between dispassionately pricing risk and sexism remains
		    extremely controversial.</p>
		  <p> </p>
		  <p><strong>Case #12: Synthetic Meat</strong></p>
		  <p>Science has always been on the forefront of making food easier to produce,
		    but the possibility of synthetically produced meat has some people wondering
		    if it has gone too far.</p>
		  <p>Traditionally, of course, making meat requires raising, feeding, and slaughtering
		    animals. Scientists like Dr. Vladimir Mironov at the Medical University
		    of South Carolina in Charleston, however, have begun to engineer rudimentary
		    forms of meat without producing animals at all, merely growing the meat
		    in a nutrient bath[53]. Muscle cells from various animals are isolated,
		    then placed in a nutrient-rich mixture to divide. After a suitable number
		    of cells are present, they are attached to a structure to grow in a &#8220;bioreactor.&#8221; Currently
		    the synthetically grown meat is not ready for human consumption. It is
		    slimy, visually unappealing, and lacks the familiar texture of meat grown
		    on animals. Mentioning the technology also seems to turn off many meat-eaters,
		    who see animal-grown meat as more &#8220;natural.&#8221; If synthetically
		    produced meat could eventually become cheap enough, however, it may feature
		    in solutions to some of the world&#8217;s hunger problems. Since it does
		    not require the rest of the animal-production infrastructure, it may be
		    able to accomplish this cost-savings at the same time it dodges the problems
		    with animal hygiene and disease.</p>
		  <p>If synthetically produced meat were ever to become more appealing (either
		    by matching animal-grown meat in terms of quality or undercutting it in
		    terms of price), much of the agriculture surrounding meat may be threatened.
		    Ranchers and farmers may lose important sources of income. Food policy
		    reform advocates such as author and professor Michael Pollan say that modern
		    society is already unfamiliar with the sources of its nourishment and synthetically
		    produced meat would exacerbate that problem. Millennia of eating animal-grown
		    meat has shown meat to be (largely) safe for human consumption. No such
		    data exists on meat grown in nutrient baths. Since synthetic meat could
		    also be genetically engineered to bring out desirable traits, some detractors
		    claim it will suffer from the same criticisms leveled at other genetically
		    modified foods.</p>
		  <p>Animal rights activists are also split on the potential benefits and costs
		    associated with synthetic meat production. The controversial animal rights
		    group known as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has announced
		    a $1 million dollar prize to the first scientist or group who can make
		    synthetic chicken meat as commercially appealing as animal-grown meat.
		    PETA&#8217;s reasoning seems to be that since synthetically produced meat
		    does not harm any animals, it is ethically preferable to animal-grown meat.
		    By growing the meat in laboratories, it will endure no more suffering than
		    a plant does growing hydroponically or out in the field.</p>
		  <p>But not all animal rights supporters see a silver lining around the synthetic
		    production of meat. If animal suffering is the only thing that makes meat
		    production unethical, presumably we should feel fine about eating synthetically
		    produced cat and dog meat, and maybe even human meat. Furthermore, the
		    long term benefits of moving to a more vegetarian diet may be much better
		    for human health and the environment than simply finding more substitutes
		    for meat.</p>
		  <p>Scientists respond to these criticisms by noting that if meat were synthetically
		    produced, it would contain pure muscle cells only, putting manufacturers
		    in better control of fat content and other unhealthy by-products of non-synthetic
		    meat.</p>
		  <p> </p>
		  <p><strong>Case #13: Medical Professionals&#8217; Role in Torture</strong></p>
		  <p>In October 2006, the United States enacted the Military Commissions Act
		    of 2006. This act authorized the use of military tribunals for enemy combatants,
		    along with the right to hold them indefinitely without judicial review
		    under the terms of habeas corpus. Part of the Act was an amendment which
		    retroactively rewrote the War Crimes Act, effectively immunizing those
		    applying policies of water-boarding, stress positioning, sleep deprivation,
		    and other controversial military tactics from prosecution under U.S. law.</p>
		  <p>Beyond the moral issues related to the use of torture there is a debate
		    regarding the role of medical professionals in overseeing and providing
		    medical attention associated with such practices. For example, investigators
		    for the Red Cross published a report in 2006 which concluded that medical
		    professionals working for the C.I.A. monitored prisoners undergoing waterboarding,
		    apparently to make sure they did not drown. Medical workers were also present
		    when guards confined prisoners in small boxes, shackled their arms to the
		    ceiling, kept them in frigid cells and slammed them repeatedly into walls,
		    the report said.</p>
		  <p>According to other accounts when medical professionals were not present
		    during harsh interrogations they have assisted afterwards by stitching
		    wounds caused by the blows of guards, replacing dislocated shoulders resulting
		    from hanging by the arms, etc. At times, the reports of such medical professionals
		    have assisted in the identification of prisoner abuse. On other occasions
		    medical staff has been complicit in hiding abuse and even death by altering
		    or camouflaging the injuries they reported.</p>
		  <p>There is nothing about medical personnel that makes them intrinsically
		    more or less moral than the rest of the population, but doctors at least
		    take the Hippocratic Oath, &#8220;to do no harm.&#8221; In addition, many
		    doctors submit to the Nuremberg Code, enacted in reaction to the human
		    rights abuses of Nazi doctors who engaged in experimentation on human subjects;
		    this code provides ten tenets of ethical medical research. Some are seriously
		    concerned that when medical personnel participate in harsh interrogations,
		    they are violating their most basic oath, and other ethical requirements
		    of the medical field. Others worry about the ways that medical personnel
		    can be complicit, including sharing prisoner&#8217;s medical records with
		    interrogators in an effort to reveal vulnerabilities.</p>
		  <p>Others argue that without the presence of medical personnel harsh interrogations
		    would be less effective and more dangerous. Medical supervision offers
		    the possibility of a more controlled environment including greater emphasis
		    on prisoner welfare. It may also make interrogations more effective and
		    thus contribute to homeland security</p>
		  <p> </p>
		  <p><strong>Case #14: Mining In West Papua</strong></p>
		  <p>The Grasberg mine in West Papua, New Guinea is the largest, most productive
		    open-pit copper mine in the world and may be the largest source of gold
		    for the foreseeable future. PT Freeport, the Indonesian subsidiary of mining
		    giant Freeport-McMoran, has owned and operated the Grasberg mine under
		    government contract since 1967. As a result of the success at Grasberg
		    PT Freeport has become a leading contributor to Indonesia&#8217;s economy,
		    its largest exporter and its highest taxpayer. In addition to the immense
		    benefits to the Indonesian economy the Grasberg mine has helped Freeport-McMoran
		    to become highly successful returning hundreds of millions in profits to
		    its shareholders.</p>
		  <p>Beyond the benefits to corporate shareholders the open-pit mine at Grasberg
		    has the consequence of providing inexpensive copper to help fuel growth
		    in the developing world. Copper is a vital ingredient in the generation
		    and transmission of electricity, plays a significant role in telecommunications,
		    and is required for numerous industrial applications. As a result persons
		    in need of expanded electrical services and an increased industrial base
		    are all stakeholders in mines like Grasberg. Of special note are those
		    stakeholders for whom inexpensive copper is crucial for the beginnings
		    of industry and consumer electricity, especially those in the developing
		    world. Unfortunately, Freeport&#8217;s success has not come without a cost.</p>
		  <p>At the time mining began the Grasberg mine appeared as a road winding
		    up to the top of a decapitated mountain. Now the open-pit style mine appears
		    as an immense crater in the earth several times the size of the original
		    mountain. PT Freeport contends that the open-pit mining style is more efficient
		    than traditional tunneling methods and is safer for mine workers. Although
		    they admit the open-pit is aesthetically unpleasing, they claim the environmental
		    damage is negligible. Environmental groups point out that the loss of rich
		    land and wild life is only half of the picture. Also of concern is the
		    dumping of tailings, the discarded waste material produced by mining, into
		    the Fly river. The operation at Grasberg deposits 40 million tons of sediment
		    into a 20-kilometer stretch of the 1000-kilometer river which naturally
		    receives a total of 90 million tons of deposit per year.</p>
		  <p>Also, of concern is the effect that the mine has had on the 20,000 members
		    of two indigenous tribes, the Amungme and the Kamoro. In 1967 both tribes
		    had had some contact with western missionaries, but practiced traditional
		    lifestyles including subsistence farming, fishing and hunting. The mining
		    operation has made traditional food sources vanish and has brought an influx
		    of approximately 100,000 foreigners. The result is that a city has been
		    erected and the traditional living arrangements of the Amungme and Kamoro
		    are now impossible. Some indigenous people have assimilated and begun working
		    for PT Freeport, while others have protested what they consider an illegal
		    taking of their land.</p>
		  <p>In response to the protests of native Papuans PT Freeport has adopted
		    a two-prong strategy, both making threats and offering benefits to the
		    Amungme and Kamoro. Beginning in the late 1960&#8217;s, PT Freeport employed
		    both private security and the Indonesian military, and at present spends
		    upwards of $500 million dollars each year in security for its Indonesian
		    facilities. These security forces have been implicated in numerous beatings,
		    rapes, killings, disappearances and bombings over the last 40 years. As
		    a second prong PT Freeport has offered to compensate the Amungme and Kamoro
		    at the rate of 1% of the Grasberg mine&#8217;s yearly profits. Some local
		    leaders claim this amount is too small, while others assert that no amount
		    of money is adequate to compensate for their forced change in lifestyle.</p>

		  <p><strong>Case #15: Obese Airline Passengers</strong></p>
		  <p>Irish airline Ryanair recently raised media attention by suggesting that
		    it may implement a surcharge for passengers above a specified weight limit
		    or waist circumference. According to a representative, one in three passengers
		    surveyed favors an extra fee for overweight passengers.</p>
		  <p>In response to this so-called &#8220;fat tax&#8221; some have argued that
		    extra fees amount to discrimination against the obese.</p>
		  <p>Most U.S. airlines have policies regarding seats for obese passengers;
		    however, these policies are not well publicized. Defending this tendency
		    to be secretive, airline companies state that they prefer to be discreet
		    about announcing this particular area of policy because their onsite workers
		    try to find comfortable seating for all passengers if they possibly can
		    do so. Southwest Airlines, for example, places its Obese Passenger policy
		    on its website.</p>
		  <p>The lack of a clearly communicated policy on obesity, though, can result
		    in obese people being bumped to a later flight or hit with a double fare
		    or both, due to lack of information. In fairness, this would be likely
		    to occur only with an inexperienced passenger, since agents in the airports
		    usually inform the client, diplomatically in most cases, of the requirements.</p>
		  <p>Most airlines now require obese people to purchase two tickets in coach.
		    Usually the company refunds the extra fare if the flight does not fill
		    up, making that second seat available. If the negotiation occurs at the
		    gate, no extra fare changes hands if there are empty seats. On the other
		    hand, boarding-time decisions have included incidents of humiliating treatment
		    of passengers, who are called out from the line and confronted in public
		    with their extra-fare obligation, and an option to stand by for a plane
		    offering extra seats.</p>
		  <p>Passengers who are 6&#8217;5&#8221; and taller are also met with problems
		    of inadequate space on planes.[70] However, they do not encounter policies
		    requiring them to arrange appropriate seating for themselves, e.g. by obtaining
		    aisle or emergency row seats, preferably in advance. One obese passenger
		    states that he observed a seat being taken out in a bulkhead row, to allow
		    a tall passenger his leg-room, while he, the fat man, had been offered
		    no comparable accommodation.</p>
		  <p>&#8220;Normal sized&#8221; passengers have claims to comfort and safety,
		    as do the obese; legion are the reports to airlines of the many experiences
		    of discomfort, and even embarrassments, that have occurred from being seated
		    next to obese people. This is not always a blanket issue of equitable enjoyment
		    of the space; for example, a thin person might have a chronic shoulder
		    or back disorder that requires her to favor one armrest, or else expect
		    proportional support from both. She requests aisle seats for every flight,
		    but cannot always obtain them. If one or both armrests has in effect disappeared
		    into the flesh of another, the back-pain surges up needlessly, and she
		    either suffers in silence or files a complaint. Many slim passengers do
		    not complain and in fact they quietly sacrifice some of their seating space
		    with compassion and empathy. Still, it is they, not the airlines and not
		    the obese people, who pay for extras the overweight people receive.</p>
		  <p>In January of 2008, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the &#8220;one
		    person, one ticket&#8221; policy that has been the touchstone of passenger
		    services since commercial aviation began. The Court said it is discrimination
		    to require extra fares from the differently-abled, including those who
		    are obese because of an illness and/or medically recognized condition.
		    As of January, 2009, Canadian companies must provide a second seat free
		    for disabled passengers. The firms have complied, but they require medical
		    notation, weeks in advance of the flight, of the disability or of the obesity&#8217;s
		    medically-recognized origin. They supply a form for physicians to fill
		    out, including instructions with a diagram on how to &#8220;measure the
		    obese person&#8217;s butt.&#8221;</p>
		  <p>Obesity remains a controversial subject. Some argue that most obesity
		    results from poor individual choices, including excessive calorie intake
		    and a sedentary lifestyle. Others believe that obesity more likely results
		    from genetic makeup, metabolic disorders or illnesses, or social conditions
		    for which obese individuals should not be held responsible</p>
