      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> I have an electrical engineer&#8217;s degree, from the University
        of Engineering in Lima, Peru, and a Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie
        Melon in 1973. And, after I completed the degree I was hired to the research
        faculty at CMU, and I have been here since&#8212;as an employee&#8212;since
        January 1, 1974. </p>
      <p><strong>MD: </strong>Very stable.</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Oh yeah&#8230;I have a home here. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do
          there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>The Software Engineering Institute was created by the department
        of<br>
  defense as a result of a recommendation from a study group in 1983. Basically,
  the situation was that, up to that point, hardware was the dominant thing.
  So they had all these weapons and computers, and hardware was the thing they
  focused on. But, little by little, they were getting into the software business.
  There was a lot more software driving all of the systems; it wasn&#8217;t just
  the hardware. And they were beginning to have problems and delays and cost
  overruns. So, there was a study group&#8212;they organize this periodically
  to discuss some particular topic. In 1983 there was a study group that looked
  at the problems the department of defense was having with software, and recommended
  that the department of defense create was is called a federally funded research
  and development center (FFRDC). FFRDC&#8217;s are a special corporation. They
  are created by act of Congress, and they are dedicated to work with one of
  the U.S departments or units. So, for example, Cal Tech&#8217;s jet propulsion
  laboratory is an FFRDC that works for NASA. Lincoln Laboratories at MIT is
  a FFRDC that works for the department of defense. They are very old&#8212;they
  started right after World War II. So there are probably over 50 or 60 of those.
  They are all created with a specific charter from Congress, and there is some
  department&#8212;department of defense&#8212;or some unit like the Navy&#8212;that
  oversees the activities in the unit. So, the recommendation was that the department
  of defense needed to create a software engineering institute dedicated to looking
  at software problems that the department of defense was having. The department
  of defense would oversee this. They also wanted a competition, so they asked
  the department of defense to draft a request for proposals so that a number
  of universities&#8212;I don&#8217;t remember the details exactly&#8230;but
  I think the recommendation was it has to be run by a university. There might
  be industry partnerships, but they wanted somebody independent because many
  of the companies that might be bidding to be the software engineering institute
  might also be contractors, so they would have a conflict of interest. So there
  were a number&#8212;around 20 or so&#8212;universities and groups of universities
  that bid for that. We were chosen as the first bid, and then there was some
  negotiation&#8230;because usually what happens is you rank them&#8230;you negotiate
  with the first one, and if you find an agreement, then they get the contract
  or you go on to the next one. So, this was happening in the fall of &#8217;84.
  We started on January 1, 1985. </p>
      <p><strong>MD: </strong>Okay. Originally in &#8217;85 it was given the name software engineering?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yes, from the beginning. In fact, the recommendation said the department
        of defense has to create a software engineer institute. </p>
      <p><strong>MD: </strong>So, what do they mean by software engineering? </p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> The term is interesting. The word engineering is in some states
        reserved for people with specific educational degrees, but it&#8217;s
        not universal. The first time that the term software engineering, as
        opposed to software coding or developing, [was used] seems to be the
        NATO conferences in the late &#8216;60s. I think it was 1968. There were
        two of those conferences&#8212;1968 and 1969. But the first time that
        the term was ever used was at one of these NATO conferences in the late
        60s. During the &#8216;70s you didn&#8217;t hear a lot of references
        to that term, but it was in the community. And, when the recommendation
        came, there was a recognition that this was an emerging engineering discipline.
        And, they said if that&#8217;s what you want to call it, you want the
        institute dedicated to that. It wasn&#8217;t software science, software
        programming, or anything like that. It was an engineering discipline.
        The request for proposals was interesting because it had a number of
        candidate problems, and so the proposal that the bidders had to provide
        was how would they address this particular collection of problems. What
        was interesting was that the problems were not all technical bits and
        bites kind of things. One of the problems, for example, was about legal
        issues and licensing. In fact, it required that whoever won the contract
        had to work with lawyers. It had to do with the department of defense
        getting in trouble with licensing and rights to software. They would
        pay a contractor, and all of a sudden the contractor would deliver the
        software, and then the department of defense needed to do some updates
        and they discovered that they didn&#8217;t have the rights to touch it.
        And so they had to go back to the original contractors. So, one of the&#8212;in
        the first year we had a number of lawyers, mostly academics from the
        University of Pittsburgh Law Department. CMU doesn&#8217;t have one&#8212;</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> That&#8217;s across the street.</p>
      <p> <strong>MB:</strong> Yes, right across the street. Exactly. The lawyers who looked at
        licensing issues we experienced in how intellectual property rights are
        managed. And, in particular in software, it&#8217;s very easy for hardware
        devices, but how do you patent or copyright software? I mean, that was
        going back to the early&#8230;1985, the first year of the institute.
        And, the results were on the form of recommendations&#8230;technical
        reports to the department of defense.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> So that&#8217;s still one of the things you do primarily, technical reports
  for the department of defense. </p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>Yes, but they are public. And, in fact, we work a lot more with industry
    than we do with the department of defense proper. Because the department
    of defense has changed. They have now very little internal development activities.
    Most of the software development testing and maintenance is done by private
    contractors. And so we tend to work with industry, and we provide reports
    which tend to be public. Very few things are kept under wraps. Only when
    they involve proprietary issues. For example, we might work on some contract
    on some acquisition issues or we learn about what the contractor might be
    providing and we might give some advice to the acquisition agency. Those
    reports would be kept confidential.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> Have you in particular used the term &#8220;software architecture&#8221;? </p>
      <p> <strong>MB:</strong> Yes.</p>
      <p> <strong>MD: </strong>So somebody would want you to essentially be writing the specifications
        for development of the piece of software.</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Right. Typically what happens is that we are approached by some unit of
    the Department of Defense. Some part of the Army, some Army project, who
    will ask us to conduct an evaluation of something that is being proposed
    by a contractor or they will ask us for some assistance in developing the
    request for proposal. Because it becomes a very touchy thing once you have
    a request for proposal out, you cannot touch it. It&#8217;s a very contentious
    thing, so they want to make sure that they ask the right questions there,
    and ask for the right documents in the proposal. So we get involved in lots
    of pre-acquisition projects as well as projects that are already awarded.
    There is a contractor in place, they are maybe two years on the project and
    the department may ask us to go and do an evaluation. We do this with a number
    of units: Army, Navy, Air Force, not just Department of Defense; we have
    a large project working with the Coast Guard, which is the department of
    Transportation. IRS at some point. Etc.</p>
      <p><strong>MD: </strong>And when you went out to do an evaluation do you just evaluate the process,
    or do you test the software? </p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>No. That is the difference. There is a group at SEI that does process measurements
    and what they analyze is the ability of the organization to carry out software
    projects. And they do have interviews, questionnaires, to assess that. What
    we do is not look at the organization but look at the projects and the product.
    And we ask for a presentation of the business writers. What is driving that
    organization to develop that software? Sometimes the business representation
    is provided by somebody from the user&#8212;say, the Coast Guard needs a
    system that doesn&#8217;t fail during a search-and-rescue operation. Sometimes
    it is the contractor or a company that is trying to sell a product and will
    say there is a market for this kind of product, this is the business driver.
    Then we ask for the developer, the head of the team, usually the architect
    of the software. We ask them, okay, explain to us what properties your system
    will have, what are you producing, what kind of components, and so on. And
    then we ask the stake holders in the system, we invite the large group of
    people&#8212;some of them are users, some might be maintainers, some might
    be customers of this system&#8212;and ask them: what do you think&#8230;would
    be important for you? And we ask them to propose a scenarios describing what
    this system will do, transmit messages in less than two seconds from point
    A to point B or whatever. Whatever matters to them. Then we prioritize those
    scenarios and ask the architect present while this is all happening, &#8216;Okay,
    look at the scenario number one, explain how your system will do that.&#8217; And,
    sometimes the result of that is &#8216;Gee, the system is unable to do it&#8230;maybe
    we need to change something in the software or we haven&#8217;t thought of
    that particular component of the system.&#8217; So we don&#8217;t know for
    example if those two components will use the same parameters and they were
    able to talk with each other. Sometimes issues might be postponed but what
    is very important is that we discover and comment on any misunderstanding
    between the stakeholders. It is always a social cultural problem. People
    don&#8217;t talk to each other and having a meeting where we ask all of the
    variety of stakeholders to propose the scenarios is a very important way
    for them to communicate. We have seen lots and lots of these meetings where
    the architect is surprised that the users of the system had completely different
    intentions of the system. So the architects say, &#8216;Oh we&#8217;re going
    to do this thing that is just super fast, and the user says I don&#8217;t
    care about the speed; I want it to be very easy to use.&#8217; You know like
    readable screens, and the architect might not have thought of that. Or the
    business driver is driven by his boss bragging that the system is going to
    give us 20% of the world market, and the architect is scratching his head
    and says, &#8216;Oops, that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re doing.&#8217; So,
    we tend to notice that most of the problems in the projects that get delayed
    or postponed, or go way over budget have to do with lack of communication
    between developers and stakeholders. The people that work on this project
    all have advanced degrees in computer science or software engineering and
    they are all techies and we&#8217;re discovering that the problem is lack
    of communication. Technology is not the problem.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> So, basically you&#8217;ve become a social engineer.</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> It&#8217;s a social engineering thing. People don&#8217;t talk to
        each other. People don&#8217;t express their requirement or document
        what they are doing. It goes on and on and you see that continuously. </p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> You&#8217;ve already answered that, but are you a software developer?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> No, I was always a researcher and all my time in the faculty so
        when I had to develop software it would have to be something that we
        were prototyping. I started my career in design automation so I was writing
        software to design computers. So, yeah, I developed software for a number
        of years but it was just for a specific internal project. It was nothing
        commercial.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> So the process was that you got an engineering degree?</p>
      <p><strong>MB</strong>: In Lima, right.</p>
      <p><strong>MD: </strong>You got&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>a Ph.D. here at Carnegie Melon in computer science.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> And your interest was in interfacing&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Right. Initially my thesis was about design automation, and then
        over the years what tended to happen was I was interested in designing
        hardware but all I was really doing was writing software. No surprise
        you see a number of companies and organizations that initially were building
        hardware devices, you know, automobile companies. I know, because we
        do work with some of them. Traditionally everybody thinks well, automobile
        is about nuts and bolts and people, but you would be surprised how much
        software is in the modern cars. </p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> I hang around with mechanical engineers at IIT and a lot of them replaced
    parts of cars with software, various mechanical measuring devices. So I have
    a sense of what is happening. One thing that we&#8217;re kind of interested
    in is what their origins are, how they end up in this field. <br>
  And are you an engineer? Without quotes, not a &#8220;software engineer&#8221;,
  but an engineer now?</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Oh, that is an interesting question. I am in a boundary. A lot of
        the things I do, are engineering-like activities. We work with customers,
        we have a specific deadline so, I don&#8217;t tend to work as a scientist
        exclusively. I&#8217;m not in some ivory tower, or working on far out
        projects. The things I tend to do are very specific. Lots of deadlines
        because we&#8217;re working with customers, so in that sense it is of
        an engineering activity. </p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software Engineering
    and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s interesting. I&#8217;ve been a member of both organizations
        for many, many years as well as something else called IFIP which is the
        International Federation of Information Processing. I tended to work
        as volunteer and officer in various organizations. So, I&#8217;ve been
        involved in professional activities for many years. It was early on in
        my career and that was something important to me. In the late 70&#8217;s
        I was part of a group that formed a new IFIP working group and become
        its first chairman. In the late 80&#8217;s I was approached by a friend
        to run as a candidate for the board of governors of the [IEEE] Computer
        Society. I was elected to the board of governors of the Computer Society
        and I had, beginning in the late 80&#8217;s, a number of positions. I
        was the president of the Computer Society in 1996. Vice president for
        technical activities prior to that as well. When the idea of having a
        committee to look into the creation of a software engineering profession,
        that was initially proposed at a meeting of the board of governors&#8212;I
        believe it must have been &#8217;92 or early &#8217;93&#8212;by a gentleman
        named Fletcher Buckley. You will see his name there. It shows up in some
        of the early&#8230;unfortunately he died maybe a couple of years later.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> He wrote papers on professionalization of software engineering?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Right. Fletcher is the one, he was a member of the board of governors
        and he is the one who essentially started pushing the board of governors
        to create a committee to look into that. I think it was May of &#8217;93
        that the Computer Society board passed a resolution. You will confirm
        the date that&#8230;May 21, &#8217;93 is when the board of governors
        passed that resolution that we&#8217;re going to form that committee.
        The ACM just a few weeks later passed a similar resolution saying that
        we need to look at that. We&#8217;ve always had lots of connections with
        them, joint members; so, it was not a surprise that we were on the same
        wavelength. So we decided that instead of doing two independent things,
        we will create a joint committee. So, from the beginning it was a joint
        committee of the two societies. I was appointed as the chairman as the
        first, initial committee. Later on I had to step down when I was elected
        President of the Computer Society because there were going to be too
        many things on my plate. But I ran that committee for a couple of years
        and that is when we started the joint task forces: one of them dedicated
        to the code of ethics; another one looking at the conducting of a survey
        of software engineering practices; another one looking at software engineering
        education. So, I started my involvement with this activity while I was
        the first co-chair, if you will. There was an ACM person [Stu Zweben]&#8230;we
        were both working together. We had an equal number of members present
        in these two societies.</p>
      <p><strong>6. What led you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Mostly as an overseer of that. I wasn&#8217;t really part of the
        committee. The steering committee was a small group, only 8 people. Three
        members from each society plus the chair and co-chair. Underneath that
        we had three task forces, and each one had a number of people. There
        was no requirement that they had to have equal numbers of people from
        the two societies. Don Gotterbarn was appointed as the chair of the committee
        looking into the code of ethics, and he picked his own volunteers. At
        one point I remember early on in the project he was in England on a sabbatical
        of some kind and so he was doing a lot of work abroad and he had some
        of the English faculty involved in the project. I was never part of that
        group, but I would get these periodic progress reports from Don.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> This question was not designed for you, so let me rephrase it. What led
    you to serve as the chair of the committee? What were you trying to do? What
    made it worth doing?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> It was in the Computer Society, and I won&#8217;t speak for the ACM. In
  the Computer Society it was very clear that software engineering was an emerging
  field&#8212;that, for example, we have a number of publications, a number of
  conferences. We organize over a 130 some conferences a year and we have 19
  publications, magazines as well as transactions. And it was very clear that
  the topics were evolving. The Computer Society started in 1946, IEEE goes back
  some 100 years. Initially it was mostly about hardware engineering. Over the
  years it was evolving and it was very clear in the early 90&#8217;s that in
  fact most of our members really had something to do with software. That it
  was not people building metal components, they are not wiring things; they
  were coding things. So the necessity of defining that profession, the necessity
  of defining a curriculum that way you could certify that this person had the
  right training to become a software engineer was becoming very important. In
  the initial recommendation there is a description of that background. In fact,
  in most professions there is an accepted educational background. There is a
  curriculum that anybody in that profession understands. This is what the person
  in that field is to know. And this is how that person learns that. It turns
  out there isn&#8217;t such a thing for software engineering. Not in an accepted
  way. There is a joint Computer Society and ACM curriculum recommended for software
  engineers, but it is mostly undergraduate curriculum updated every few years.
  It is good work but that is incorporated in the other task force on education.
  One of the things we noted in the very first report was that professions not
  only have this body of knowledge, this is what anybody in that field needs
  to know, and this is how to learn it. They also tend to have a code of ethics.
  That is an important aspect of being a profession. That there is a code of
  conduct that members adhere to. So, from the beginning there was the need to
  develop a code of ethics&#8212;Don might have more information on this&#8212;that
  was going to be more specific to software engineers. So we couldn&#8217;t just
  adopt the ACM code that already existed or the IEEE code because they were
  very broad. We needed a code that focused on the kinds of problems that software
  engineers might face, the kind of situations they might encounter. Things like
  the conduct in the proper testing for something or reporting a particular problem.
  Initially, the program were used mostly by other engineers, so in the 1970&#8217;s
  if the program had a bug, well, that usually meant somebody&#8217;s experiment
  in the laboratory failed. Big deal. In the &#8216;90&#8217;s, everybody and
  their brother are using the internet and sending email and many of them don&#8217;t
  have a clue how the computer is working. So, all of a sudden you have to say, &#8216;Okay,
  we don&#8217;t want the person to have to know all about computers, therefore
  the person who is developing the software needs to do it right.&#8217; And
  that is where the need for a code of ethics focuses on the situation and on
  the needs of the environment where software engineers will work.</p>
      <p><strong>AS:</strong> How much of this was driven by concern for the public and software engineer&#8217;s
  relationship with the public and their safety?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Definitely. The need for the code of ethics&#8230;was one of the drivers.
  The reason you needed one is that software was becoming more and more visible
  and there were no clear rules for who could develop software, what they have
  to know and what were their responsibilities if something failed. There was
  nothing. And comparing that with other professions, lots of other professions,
  they all had some code of conduct. And so it was very clear from the get-go
  that we need one but we didn&#8217;t know what that code of conduct will be.
  It was all Don&#8217;s work and his committee who focused and decided that
  this was going to be important and the particulars in the code. So the steering
  committee didn&#8217;t give any guidance or specific instructions. This all
  came directly from the working committee; the instructions to them were four
  lines of text that said, we need a code of conduct. They did the rest.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Oh yes...as a reader. I have been a member of the IEEE and the Computer
        Society and the ACM for years, and one of the things that the two organizations
        do is once a year when you renew your membership you get a copy of the
        code of ethics. It&#8217;s about a page or two and I&#8217;ve read them
        in the past&#8230;they can be very general. I&#8217;m not an expert in
        codes of ethics; I know that the American Bar Association has one but
        I don&#8217;t know what it says. I&#8217;m sure the American Medical
        Association has one but I don&#8217;t know what it says. So it&#8217;s
        not my field of interest, so there was nothing I could provide as guidance.
        I was mostly a conduit. Don would communicate with me. He would send
        me the new releases as they were developed in the code of ethics, and
        I would arrange that they would be posted on the Computer Society web
        site. But I wasn&#8217;t really involved in any of their meetings. </p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> I think you just answered most of my question; basically, you received
        the documents and posted them and kind of watched&#8230;<br>
        <strong>MB:</strong> Right, and watched. And arranged briefings so once in a while Don would
  have to brief me and the board of governors. So I will schedule those briefings.<br>
  <strong>MD:</strong> So you were present at the briefing?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yes.</p>
      <p><strong>MD: </strong>Can you give us a picture of what those looked like?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> They were mostly status reports. There was&#8230;only for Don to
        give a tutorial to the members of the board of governors. He would give
        them an advanced copy of the code, so they all had it and then he would
        describe the status&#8230;&#8217;we are working on the next portion and
        perhaps we&#8217;re going to have&#8217;&#8230;he also tended to organize
        workshops or special sessions in various conferences in the field as
        a way of disseminating, you know, telling people this is coming, we want
        your feedback and so on. So, that would be one of the things that he
        would report to the board of governors.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> These meetings were something like the meetings that you run regarding
    software?</p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>Yes. Well, there were meetings that were run as the working committee and
    then meetings of the steering committee, and then the next meeting of the
    board of governors of the Computer Society would give a short briefing. Don
    and the other people who are running the other task forces would give short
    talks. Those briefings tended to be 15 or 20 minutes, not a big deal. Certainly,
    in the Computer Society, it was a given that there was a need for the code
    of ethics and Don had included lots of people from around the world, that
    was one of the important things that he did, we didn&#8217;t want it to be
    a US or North American-based code because that would create problems. The
    IEEE, and particularly the Computer Society, sees itself as an international
    society. In fact, almost 40% of the members are non-US. The IEEE is probably
    a lower percent, but it is growing. In all of the societies, the numbers
    of members from abroad and certainly the Computer Society is a big deal.
    We have lots of conferences organized around the world in many countries
    and for some of the larger conferences there is a requirement that they rotate
    around the world. So, international issues were a big deal; therefore it
    was very good that Don had people from many different countries involved
    in the task force.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>AS:</strong> What would you say are the advantages and disadvantages of the code? Just
    in general?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> This is interesting. In some professions in the past, it very often would
    be the case that some country would be such a dominant power that in fact
    that country would dictate the rules. What we notice in software is that
    it&#8217;s universal. Everybody uses the same language&#8230;they communicate
    in English typically, and they use the same programming languages. So things
    like Java are very popular. They communicate and send upgrades and do testing
    very much the same way. Let me give you an aside, one of the reasons that
    I noticed this shared culture. One of my jobs in the Computer Society today
    is that I am a judge in what is called the International Design Competition.
    Probably you have heard of the ACM programming competition, they have it
    every year, mostly in the US, Canada. What the Computer Society has is a
    larger scope. So the students are all teams of students around the world,
    universities anywhere, undergraduates, are given kits that include both hardware
    and software components and they are given an assignment. They can pick and
    choose whatever pieces of hardware, software they can use. They are given
    a limited budget, something like a $200: you can buy $200 extra software
    or hardware so that rich countries don&#8217;t get an advantage. And you
    have to build this system. This year, for example, we had 74 teams from around
    the world submitting written reports. We did this at the end of May. From
    these we pulled it down to 10 based on the written reports. So, at the end
    of the one-semester project, they send a report, 30 pages limit. We read
    them all; we&#8217;ll look at the requirements and so on. What was surprising
    is that you read the documents and unless you read the cover and see the
    name of the university or the name of the country, or the names of the participants,
    very often you couldn&#8217;t tell what country these people were from. Because
    even American students would write in broken English! (Laughs) So you couldn&#8217;t
    tell. They mentioned the same technologies, the same testing procedures and
    they mentioned the fact that they were using the same IEEE standard. You
    couldn&#8217;t tell. So, software engineering has become defacto international.
    No countries dominate in the sense of having the intellectual leadership.
    There is more industry in this country. But we&#8217;ve had, for example&#8230; a
    Polish university has been in all three competitions so far, and they are
    very good. The Canadian&#8217;s are very good; McMaster [University] and
    Waterloo are always there. Couldn&#8217;t tell this year&#8230;we had some
    Taiwanese university there. You name it&#8230;around the world.</p>
      <p><strong>AS:</strong> So that&#8217;s an advantage?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> It&#8217;s an advantage because every country will be able to develop
        and the industry can grown anywhere. Before we started this morning we
        were talking with Michael about the CMM five stages [quality levels in
        software development process] that is known all around the world. And
        companies, such as Motorola have a laboratory in India that is ranked
        one of the highest in the world. It&#8217;s a universal thing. They communicate
        in English. Use the same programming languages, use the same testing
        methodologies.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> And when you use software from Motorola, you don&#8217;t know what parts
  of it were done in India, what parts were done in England and what parts were
  done in the US because&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>They get integrated. It doesn&#8217;t require people traveling from one <br>
  country to another with boxes of metal. You transmit it overnight by the internet.
  So, for projects, pieces of components of a larger thing might be developed
  in different countries, they get integrated overnight and maybe you run tests
  every day and so on. The speed of communication makes the difference, that
  is, you might be the Chicago office but getting some stuff from Texas and some
  stuff from India.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter,
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Email correspondence with Don. That was the usual way, so I would
        get the progress reports. And Don sometimes&#8230;he would have questions.
        It was mostly email, the occasional meeting, or at a workshop, but email
        was by and large the way we communicated. And I suspect that was the
        way he communicated with his team because they were around the world.
        So, not surprising&#8212;it was already the mid-late &#8216;90s&#8212;,
        so everyone had access to the Internet and email.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better than
        the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as best?
        Why?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>Oh, that&#8217;s interesting. I wasn&#8217;t present at the meetings
        developing the code of ethics, so I don&#8217;t know how contentious
        they were. Don would be the better person to tell you about it. The steering
        committee level meetings were very business like. There were no big debates
        because all we were doing was awaiting the reports from the various task
        forces. In only one of the task forces I had a more active role. The
        task force for developing the survey on the body of knowledge. I was
        involved because that effort was falling behind schedule. It was revived
        because we got some DOD sponsorship. Someone in the DOD was very interested
        in having a body of knowledge so that they could educate their own people
        and the Department of Defense gave money to the SEI so the SEI could
        pay for the development of the survey so that got me involved in that
        task force. I suspect there might be some interesting discussions in
        the committees that were developing the code of ethics, but not at the
        steering committee level. But I wasn&#8217;t getting that. There were
        other things and you might hear them from Mary Shaw (CS Department, CMU)
        maybe the same or different. The two societies tended to have different
        positions on some things. Not so much on the code of ethics&#8230;that
        was pretty much approved by the two boards&#8230;it was a no-brainer.
        The development of the body of knowledge was a bit more contentious because
        that was getting closer and closer to the idea of having a profession
        and perhaps a certification for software engineers. And, in the Computer
        Society it was always a done deal. The board of governors was always
        unanimous in the sense that, yeah, there is a profession emerging and
        we&#8217;re going to have to have some kind of certification or accreditation
        mechanism for software engineers. The ACM was split. This goes back a
        number of years. In computer science, they are very afraid that the field
        of software engineering that started within the computer science community
        will be stolen by the engineering schools. And so they were always very
        afraid. They wanted something called software engineering because that
        is a big chunk of computer science and they don&#8217;t want to give
        it up. In different schools of engineering, computer science is part
        of engineering, in other schools computer engineering is part of computer
        science&#8230;there was a fear that the school of computer science would
        be losing its crown jewel. In my own school, this was one of the concerns
        that people had. Mary Shaw was very vocal in that regard. She was opposed
        to the idea of having a separate profession. To her, software engineering
        is a subset of computer science.</p>
      <p> <strong>MD:</strong> I have been reading her papers and I thought she was big on it growing
    into an engineering profession. But she actually wants it to be an engineering
    profession inside computer science? That&#8217;s interesting. I had no idea. </p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Because such a profession is not subject to typical engineering professions
    rules&#8230;they have accreditation boards and so on. In general, the ACM
    was always split. My first co-chair was Stu Zweben. He was later, about the
    same time I was, the president of the ACM, he&#8217;s at Ohio State. He&#8217;s
    a computer scientist and then after he became the president of ACM, they
    Dennis Fraily as co-chair. He was next to Stu and he worked for Texas Instruments.
    He was very much in favor of having certification; in fact, if you recall,
    a couple of years ago the legislature in the state of Texas passed that amendment
    and he was the consultant to the group. He works near Dallas-Fort Worth.
    So, that is coming. In the Computer Society, it was never an issue whether
    there was going to be a need for this kind of profession. It would be a profession
    and it would be like any other professions. In the ACM, they tended to have
    this split between people who were the academics in particular in computer
    science departments; this was a very scary thing; they would be losing their
    crown jewel and all of a sudden computer science would become like mathematics
    or physics. Unless you are in the big universities, physics is a very small
    department. That&#8217;s a fear. But it wasn&#8217;t universal; otherwise
    the two societies would have never been working together. So the ACM over
    the years has had this ambivalent relation on the certification side. Not
    on the code side, that was very smooth.</p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant to the
        process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Not on the code of ethics. That seemed to go very smoothly. I think
        Don was very good at socializing the process. Talking to people, conducting
        surveys, broadcasting what that group was doing. There were never any
        firestorms that I noticed, or people sending me messages, &#8216;Oh my
        God, terrible, terrible, terrible.&#8217; He was very good at socializing
        this. That is his personality, so I&#8217;m not surprised that it worked
        so well. The other one, developing the body of knowledge, that was quite
        a bit more work. We were way behind&#8230;the survey 2 or 3 years behind
        schedule and nothing came out of it. We did the survey, published the
        report and nothing happened. Then we restarted the project again with
        a different approach. We are working with the University of Montreal,
        and we have a number of people there who are leading the effort. They
        have developed what they call the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge
        and they have done two or three interim editions. They have identified
        a dozen or so main topics, they asked for volunteers around the world
        who will take the task of refining, editing, and getting comments and
        impressions. It is the trial run edition, available on the net. It&#8217;s
        a book that is about 60 or 70 pages that has all of the 12 topics and
        themes, this is what a person should know about this topic. It is being
        distributed for comments. In about a year or so they will collect all
        the comments and make a second edition and I think that will be the final,
        or first body of knowledge. Once you have the body of knowledge then
        you can influence the educational community because, if this is what
        people need to know, then we need to provide courses for that. Not all
        of them will be undergraduate level, some of them will be graduate level
        and some of it might be optional advanced education. So there is something:
        after they finally come out with the body of knowledge, there is going
        to be some integration efforts and, given that the standard curriculum
        is done jointly by the ACM and the Computer Society, there might be some
        future friction there. </p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> I noticed that the last time the accreditation people went through,
        ACM&#8217;s accreditation system is now being operated by ABET. Is there
        someway to coordinate it instead of having it separate?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yes. For a number of years the Computer Society and ACM have run a computer
    science accreditation organization called CSAB, Computer Science Accreditation
    Board. Very often ABET and CSAB visits would be coordinated to reduce the
    burden on engineering schools that also had a computer science/engineering
    department. After many years of negotiation, CSAB was incorporated into ABET.
    So ABET now has grown; that&#8217;s the Accreditation Board for Technology
    and Engineering. There is now a new commission under it which is the accreditation
    board for computer science. There was always a fear that the old CSAB would
    lose all power, that the engineers would just swamp them [the CS people].
    But it has worked just fine. In fact, schools have to be re-accredited every
    few years and I am one of the creditors for that new commission. It is interesting
    because I have seen it right in the building process. Up to 3 years ago,
    it was all run by CSAB; by this year it will all be under ABET. The rule
    won&#8217;t change, the criteria, the credit hours&#8212;it is all being
    integrated and it&#8217;s going smoothly. So I see it as a working &#8220;B&#8221;.
    For example, with the visit to the University of Texas last year, it was
    a joint visit. Because back then it was still in the integration. This year
    sometime in the Fall I will be doing another one of those visits and there
    will be only one committee involved. After that, they will have an integrated
    accreditation tem for computer science, electrical engineering, and all of
    the other engineering disciplines.</p>
      <p><strong>AS:</strong> Looking back on the time before the code was implemented,
        how would you say things have changed in terms of production and development?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> I haven&#8217;t seen much difference. The code probably needs some punch
  behind it. It will have to be something that causes people to pay attention&#8230;.
  A lot of changes in the engineering discipline have been because of the lawyers.
  So that is my favorite anecdote&#8230;that in the 1850&#8217;s there were lots
  of steam ships crossing the Atlantic. Very often they would blow-up. Boilers
  were too hot, fragile. You would lose the cargo and people. Lloyds of London
  was providing insurance they had to pay on when a ship blew up. They didn&#8217;t
  like that. So they forced the Maritime industry to develop some standard processes
  for building steam boilers and the steam ships. It was the lawyers who told
  the engineers get your act together. Something like that might have to happen
  in software engineering.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> The boiler codes are a major achievement in mechanical engineering. They&#8217;re
  still maintained and it&#8217;s worth going to a library and looking at them.
  You have no idea the scale of&#8230;I guess 40 feet long, details and specifications. </p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Quality of the material, the type of coal.</p>
      <p><strong>MD: </strong>The exact placement of the thermometer. </p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> It was because Lloyd&#8217;s just got on their case. They said they
        are <br>
  not going to insure the boat unless they followed the standards. Companies
  that didn&#8217;t have the insurance couldn&#8217;t possibly survive in business.
  So, what might have to happen is there might have to have been attempts, people
  have tried to sue each other, there have been some cases where software surfaces
  in the case. What happens so far is that lawyers don&#8217;t seem to be very
  comfortable talking about software. So, they have a case where a judge passes
  a decision where this company did something terrible because they didn&#8217;t
  follow the standards for software development. Or their developers lied about
  something, or didn&#8217;t behave appropriately and didn&#8217;t conduct tests,
  for example, and the judge might say they didn&#8217;t follow this code of
  conduct. They didn&#8217;t tell their supervisor they had a problem in this
  or that area. And all of a sudden people will pay attention. That hasn&#8217;t
  happened yet. So right now, the way it seems is that the code of ethics is
  an academic topic. Academics know about it and talk about it, there might be
  another version coming in a year or two. By and large, industry is not aware
  of what we are paying attention to.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>AS: </strong>So in other words, it hasn&#8217;t affected the business?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> All it would take is, as I said, a case in which a judge makes a
        decision saying, &#8216;The people who are guilty or are responsible
        for the damage because they didn&#8217;t follow the recommendations in
        the code of ethics.&#8217; And this will be cited in the case because
        it&#8217;s an official document for these two organized societies, so
        somebody could actually cite it. And, if a judge says these people violated
        the code of ethics and therefore they go to jail or pay a fine&#8212;that
        will get people&#8217;s attention. </p>
      <p><strong>AS:</strong> Well, if that&#8217;s not the case, the code is perceived as having no
  bite, no teeth, how do the people that are supposed to adhere to it see the
  code?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Well, having no teeth in the sense that there is no mechanism to enforce
    it. The sanctions will have to come from a legal case. As an aside, England
    has a similar society to the IEEE. The Institute of Electrical Engineers,
    the IEE. They have a different role than the IEEE. In England, IEEE membership
    automatically gives you a license to practice. So, becoming a member is a
    bit harder than becoming a member in the IEEE. You have to have certain degree
    of education, certain courses, and once you are a member, you are a chartered
    engineer. And, you can practice the profession. In this country, the IEEE
    or the ACM don&#8217;t have that. You don&#8217;t have to be a member, whereas
    in England you have to be a member if you want to work as an engineer or
    developer. So, if the IEE in England, for example, has a code of ethics&#8230;then
    people have to follow that code of ethics. We haven&#8217;t got to that stage
    here. </p>
      <p><strong>12.</strong> Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant to your
        participation in the process? May we have a copy?</p>
      <p>Mario provided a stack of documents (steering-committee level). </p>
      <p><strong>13.</strong> Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result of your
        participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Not particularly, no. I always thought it was a good idea that people
        know&#8230;must know what they&#8217;re&#8230;and by and large the code
        is a lot of common sense. So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s like a great
        surprise for a developer. They might learn a couple of things&#8230;steps
        to follow. In particular, I suspect, even if it is adopted and everybody
        has to follow it&#8230;it will only affect people who are involved in
        safety critical software. You know, if you are working in an aircraft
        factory plant&#8230;you know, you&#8217;re building software that goes
        in a 777. Those will be the kinds of things. If you&#8217;re building
        software that goes into a video game&#8230;probably not a big deal. So,
        it will be separated by the industry in which they are working.</p>
      <p> <strong>AS:</strong> How do you think clients see the code?</p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>I don&#8217;t even think clients know there exists such a thing. </p>
      <p><strong>AS:</strong> So, if their expectation is to something that doesn&#8217;t follow the
  code or goes against the code&#8212;</p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>You mean somebody who buys the software?</p>
      <p><strong>AS:</strong> A client that contracts a company to develop some software.</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> What I suspect is that the people who are developing the software will
    develop software that meets their requirements. They probably don&#8217;t
    care how they do it. You know, unless they stole somebody else&#8217;s patent
    or something like that. They pretty much&#8230;they couldn&#8217;t care whether
    they followed exactly all of these steps, that they did the appropriate level
    of testing, or the right communication between the right development teams.
    They couldn&#8217;t care less. </p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of ethics?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> It&#8217;s mostly educational&#8230;for the developers&#8230;knowing
        what their <br>
  limits are. And, also, enabling them. Having a code of ethics that is widely
  acceptable will give the ammunition for somebody who is uncomfortable with
  something happening in a project&#8230;being able to point to the code of ethics
  and challenge the supervisor. Or going to the president of the company and
  saying, &#8216;Oh my God, we&#8217;re violating a particular rule.&#8217; So,
  it will enable people&#8230;it will give them that freedom to challenge something. </p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation you are especially pleased
        with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Very pleased with the code of ethics. It was always on schedule,
        and Don did a very good job. It was clear that this was not a couple
        of people working on a corner and doing their own thing. I mean, there
        was a lot of socialization into the process. And so that&#8217;s why
        it worked. Even though the code is mostly an academic topic, for the
        time being, it was never the case that there were challengesfrom some
        other group around the world. It turns out that at the time Don started,
        there were other code of ethics projects around the world. I think some
        of them were from Germany. </p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> Really? I hadn&#8217;t heard about those.</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> I think I have it here. Let me see. </p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> That&#8217;s interesting. </p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> I have a memo from one of these groups, and I forward that to Don. </p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> Was the person in Switzerland?</p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>It might have been&#8230;the name sounded like a German name. But it could
  be Swiss. When you talk to Don, ask him if he remembers the&#8212; Yes,
        there was this group&#8230;I have the emails&#8230;see the names? And
      this email was sent May 12, 1994. Two emails in the same day. </p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> No, none of these names are familiar. </p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Okay, so you keep this, and maybe you can use this in your discussion with
    Don, because they seem to be&#8230;they were doing something similar.</p>
      <p><strong>MD:</strong> A task force for professional ethics.</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> So, one thing to talk to Don about is what happened. This is a project
    that started around the same time&#8212;no, in fact, preceded Don&#8217;s
    project&#8212;what happened to that particular activity. </p>
      <p><strong>16.</strong> Is there anything about the final code that you are especially pleased
        with or unhappy about?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> No, nothing,&#8230;I like the format. This might not be an interesting
        thing. I was looking at the use of the code, and the fact that they had
        essentially a one-pager version and then lots of details behind it, as
        opposed to having another 20-page document that nobody will read, because
        your eyes glaze over. I thought that was a good way to present the code&#8230;it
        was a one pager. And some of them might have been driven by both ACM
        and the IEEE codes. They tend to be that focused&#8212;one or two pages.
        Something you can carry in your pocket, like a book. </p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems to you especially
    important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Well, my main contact was Don. He definitely was very clever in
        the way he organized the collectivity. The socialization, the communication,
        allowing anybody to provide input. So, definitely that helped. It could
        have been a disaster. I mean, you could&#8217;ve had somebody with a
        big ego that says &#8216;I know what I&#8217;m going to do&#8217; and
        draft his own code and then say to the rest of the world &#8216;Do you
        like it?&#8217; We see a lot of projects like that, and Don was completely
        different&#8230;he was very social. No, it doesn&#8217;t mean that the
        code is going to be acceptable practice in the future. So, there is a
        code&#8230;if it&#8217;s going to be updated periodically, whether it
        becomes a useful thing, something that is kept in mind by software developers
        or is just another academic exercise, remains to be seen. </p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain. </strong></p>
      <p>(SEE
          QUESTION 17).</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, would
        you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MB: </strong>I don&#8217;t know if I could answer that, because I was not very
        involved in the process. So I don&#8217;t know if something could have
        been done differently. The results were very good, but I don&#8217;t
        know if there were specific problems that Don had to deal with. He kept
        those from me. He would just send me the progress reports. </p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t?
        Anything you want to add to <br>
  what you have already said? </strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MB:</strong> No. Not that on particular. Remember that I had those three task <br>
  forces, and this was the one that nailed it down and was ahead of schedule.
    There was never any friction&#8230;I do have concerns about the way we did
    the body of knowledge&#8230;how we defined the body of knowledge. A couple
    of bad starts, and we are now doing a different version. So, I still have
    concerns about the definition of the body of knowledge, because from there,
    that is where you&#8217;re going to get this education. So, however people
    get educated to become software developers, at least there is a code of ethics
    in place. But, I&#8217;m willing to wait 20 years&#8212;if I&#8217;m still
    alive&#8212;to see whatever happened to it. </p>
      <p><strong>AS:</strong> What about the people that don&#8217;t posses the appropriate qualifications?
  What should they follow or abide by? Is there a separate code for them to follow?
  Or is there talk of developing a code for them?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> That&#8217;s interesting. So you&#8217;re talking about different ranks
  of software developers?</p>
      <p><strong>AS:</strong> Yes, those with varying degrees of skill, knowledge, or ability.</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> Yeah, in the body of knowledge that was one of the topic areas. What is
    the body of knowledge, and there are different degrees. That is, do you want
    everybody to have a Ph.D. in computer science? Well, no, that&#8217;s impractical.
    Do you want everybody to just simply hack pascal code? Well, no, that&#8217;s
    not very useful. So there is some back and forth. I don&#8217;t remember
    if the code of ethics actually addresses the level of education. I think
    it says simply &#8216;appropriate or adequate&#8217;&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t
    point to specific rank of education. But, that&#8217;s a good question. You
    caught me there by surprise. I&#8217;ll have to go back to the code and read
    if it says anything about whether you have to have a particular level of
    education or degree. I don&#8217;t think it will say that. </p>
      <p><strong>AS:</strong> So what about the people that don&#8217;t fall within that camp or category?</p>
      <p><strong>MB:</strong> That&#8217;s a good question. I suspect that if there is an engineer in
    charge of that, a group of people who are not bound by the code,&#8230;then
    the engineer is the one responsible for applying the code of ethics. So, yeah,
    people who are mainly doing part-time jobs don&#8217;t have the education&#8230;and
    they might not be responsible for following the code of ethics. But then, somebody
    in the organization has to be in charge of these people. That is true, in fact,
    in some fields. I think in civil engineering, I believe, all you need in one
    company is that one engineer has that certification so that he can sign documents.
    But, that person becomes responsible for testifying. The person who signs it
    is responsible. There has to be somebody who is responsible for the project
    at hand. And the assumption is that the person is following the code, and is
    responsible for enforcing it. </p>
