      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong></p>
      <p>S.B., MIT 1987. Computer Science and Engineering. Humanities concentration
  in Science, Technology, and Society</p>
<p>J.D., Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva University 1993.</p>
<p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do there?</strong></p>
<p> <strong>SB:</strong> My employer is a software consultancy whose clientele
  consists entirely of financial institutions and firms, primarily in the capital
  markets. Our projects
  almost always use Java as the implementation technology; this has historically
  been our niche.</p>
<p> My current assignment is with a securities clearing corporation. I began
  this assignment in February 2002. I am there to provide mentoring in Java and
  related technologies, to review and improve the Java-based systems architecture,
  and to design and implement some components of that architecture. The system
  itself is a Web-based front end for trade entry and inquiry as well as supporting
  functions.</p>
<p> My prior assignment was as the technical project manager for a trader workstation
  and trading exchange for complex commodity derivatives. My role was to meet
  with clients, gather and analyze requirements, specify the system architecture
  and detailed technical design, prepare a project plan with resource and cost
  estimates, lead an eight person development team, and do small parts of the
  implementation. This assignment lasted two years.</p>
<p> It is worth noting that during the time of my involvement with the SEEPP,
  I was a practicing attorney, focused on software and online intellectual property
  issues.</p>
<p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development?</strong></p>
<p> <strong>SB:</strong> I have been developing software professionally for thirteen
  years, from 1984-1990 and 1995-present. The first six years I worked as an
  in-house developer for
  a vendor of packaged commercial software. We made IBM protocol emulation packages
  for PCs and Unix-based systems. I was exposed to and performed tasks related
  to almost all phases of the software development lifecycle &#8212; module design,
  implementation, testing, in-house and field maintenance, and project management.
  I also participated in pre- and post-sales customer support. During the last
  seven years, I have been a software consultant to Wall Street firms. Much of
  this phase of my career has been in project and practice management, with a
  liberal amount of architecture and design, only more recently spending significant
  amounts of time doing hands-on development. In the late '90s, I did a lot of
  pre-sales work, presentations, and co-wrote and edited a technical book (Lewis,
  Barber, and Siegel, Programming in Java IDL, Wiley 1987).</p>
<p> <strong>MD: </strong>If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</p>
<p> <strong>SB:</strong> As a sequence of events, my father first introduced
  me to programming while I was in high school. He taught programming himself,
  and brought home one of
  the school's Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I computers for me (and him) to work
  with on weekends. Soon I was writing games and other programs, and even had
  a part-time job programming while other kids were flipping burgers. I knew
  that I wanted to pursue software in college and as a career direction from
  high school, and never seriously questioned that path.</p>
<p> As a matter of what aspects of software development I found attractive, it
  was probably a matter of the logical foundations and sheer determinism of programming.
  I could use what I knew and was good at to get things done, with fairly immediate
  feedback. There wasn't much else like that for me. And I have always enjoyed
  the process of programming as much if not more than the end result.</p>
<p> Since I have a bit of an unusual career path, having started in software,
  leaving it for law, and then coming back, it might be worth a couple sentences
  to discuss what led me back. While I enjoyed law school and studying the law,
  I found that law practice was mostly tedious and difficult for me. Worse, the
  clients wanted me to be aggressive and mean for them. Worse still, many clients
  complained bitterly when we charged them money to fix nasty situations that
  they, with just a little foresight, easily could have avoided. Worse, these
  situations frequently arose after they ignored our previous advice to pay us
  (much less) to do preventative or strategic legal work. Software development
  has few of these distasteful aspects, or at least they occur with far less
  frequency. Even in consulting, where clients can be demanding and unrealistic
  and frequently change their minds, working in the software field is much more
  satisfying. In short, I found that I much preferred building stuff to fighting
  about stuff.</p>
<p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB: </strong>I don't think so, though this is a very interesting question,
  and the answer is not at all clear cut.</p>
<p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software Engineering
  and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
<p> <strong>SB:</strong> In 1994, I was working as an associate to an attorney
  named Lance Rose. Lance was involved in the Computers, Freedom, and Privacy
  conference. Someone on
  the program committee asked Lance if he would speak on a CFP panel as someone
  opposed to the notion of licensing software professionals. Lance had previously
  spoken on this topic to a software consultants&#8217; group in New Jersey.
  Lance was doing other things at the conference and didn't really feel like
  he had much more to say on the topic, so he suggested I do the licensing panel
  instead, especially since I actually had a software background and he did not. </p>
<p> That panel's organizer was a fellow named Don Gotterbarn, who needs no introduction
  here. After I spoke for my ten minutes on all the evils (Lance and) I could
  think of regarding software professional licensing, Don invited me out to dinner,
  laid out his thoughts on the subject, and invited me to join the SEEPP and
  work on the software code of ethics.</p>
<p> I have often wondered why Don would have invited someone who had just &#8220;gone
  public&#8221; against the professionalization of software engineering to work,
  essentially, for such professionalization. I have several theories. One, having
  actually taken the time to research the topic and speak about it, I probably
  was as qualified as any software practitioner on the topic. Two, as a professional
  software developer who was also a practicing attorney, I had the fairly rare
  experience among software people as actually having to live under the attorneys&#8217; rules
  of ethics, for better or worse. Three, SEEPP was fairly heavy with academic
  ethicists, but light on actual programmers. Four, it often pays to keep ones
  friends close, and one's enemies closer.</p>
<p> Not that I have ever truly been an enemy of ethics codes &#8212; at worst
  I merely have commented upon them cynically. My dissatisfaction with the legal
  ethics rules stems from my belief that in practice they 1) do little more in
  practice than define the ethical envelope against which many attorneys do their
  best to push, and 2) provide a locus for statutes or regulations that basically
  codify professional protectionism against accountants and paralegals, often
  artificially inflating the cost of legal services, depriving those of modest
  means from being able to afford them.</p>
<p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
<p> <strong>SB:</strong> Besides Don's kind invitation, I looked forward to a
  chance to participate in something that could shape, hopefully for the better,
  the software field
  for many years to come, and under which I might someday have to live and practice.
  Perhaps I would have a chance to eliminate or temper unrealistic or onerous
  provisions. Perhaps I might help software engineering avoid some of the nastier
  so-called ethical burdens under which the legal profession has burdened itself.
  Working on SEEPP was also a professional networking opportunity. I also thought
  that a lawyer might have something to add by applying legal drafting skills
  to the whole resulting documents and trying to make them more self-consistent.</p>
<p> Further, I thought that a lawyer's perspective was useful to the SEEPP drafting
  process in another way. Many of the committee members were working from an
  ethicist&#8217;s standpoint, trying to construct a document that worked logically
  and coherently as a matter of ethics. They were trying to create a work that
  sought to capture and transmit values. The legal viewpoint might help make
  that lofty goal a bit more practical: helping to create a document that would
  not only express values, but that could also be interpreted for and applied
  to concrete situations. I hoped to apply the lawyer&#8217;s eye to help reduce
  unintended ambiguity, and to use language that was consistent with some of
  the legal language relevant to areas of law that might come in contact with
  the code (for example, malpractice liability and standards of care.</p>
<p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved in SEEPP?
  Explain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> I was familiar with the American Bar Association Model
  Code of Professional Responsibility and the ABA Model Rules of Professional
  Conduct, as well as
  their enactments (with variations and frequent modifications) in New York and
  New Jersey. My familiarity with them was that I completed the required legal
  ethics course that covered these codes while in law school, studied them to
  prepare for and pass the Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam, and practiced
  law for two years having to consider them from time to time to govern my actions
  as an attorney.</p>
<p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially
    in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> As it turned out, I didn't participate actively for very
  long. I recall attending two SEEPP meetings in Washington, and perhaps one
  in Philadelphia. This was
  fairly early in SEEPP's work, just after being organized. I contributed most
  actively not to the code itself, but to the SEEPP Task Force Guide to Operations,
  a set of procedural rules governing the operation of SEEPP itself. Such a document
  was required by IEEE process and was derived from a model Guide. The SEEPP
  Task Force met and revised and modified the model Guide to be appropriate to
  the concerns and structure of SEEPP. I cast a lawyerly eye on the procedures
  in the guide, and I think helped make them less ambiguous and a bit more practical.
  The task force member who acted as secretary at one of the meetings lost his
  notes (computer failure), and I reconstructed the Guide changes from the notes
  I had taken at the meeting and forwarded them to Don. Also during these meetings,
  the task force sketched out what became the high-level principles of the code.
  I was assigned to a working group for one of the principles, but I don't believe
  that the working group ever met by the time I told Don that I wouldn't be actively
  participating in SEEPP any more.</p>
<p> I stopped paying much attention to SEEP sometime in 1996. I switched back
  to software from law in September 1995. The career change left me with less
  time for SEEPP and other &quot;extra-curricular&quot; activities &#8212; I
  had to focus on learning a lot of software technology that I missed during
  my five-year excursion into the law. </p>
<p> There were some other things that added to my willingness to de-prioritize
  my SEEPP work. The SEEPP task force was dominated by academic ethicists --
  many among these were people who basically taught computer ethics courses in
  colleges for a living. First of all, among these people I was basically out
  of my league. They had spent years reading and developing the computer ethics
  literature; I could barely articulate what I thought the word ethics meant.
  Second, I was somewhat concerned about the relative lack of practicing computer
  scientists and software engineers on the task &#8211; it seemed to me that
  while ethicists could perhaps catalyze and facilitate discussions about software
  engineering ethics, there needed to be a stronger component coming from actual
  engineers who faced and ultimately had to deal with the ethical issues that
  arose in practice.</p>
<p> Third, no matter how well meaning and competent the task force members appeared
  to me, I couldn't help wondering about an appearance of a conflict of interest:
  if the code were adopted and then ultimately incorporated into state-mandated
  licensing programs, didn't the task force members stand to benefit directly
  by the increased demand (or at least increased job security) for computer ethics
  professors? Let me stress that in raising this issue, I in no way wish to even
  imply that anyone on the task force actually acted with such a motive in mind;
  I like and even admire the task force members I worked with and believe that
  they sincerely wanted to better the world by helping to draft the code. This
  was, however, an issue in my mind at the time and I still see it as a structural
  weakness in the process of drafting the code.<br>
                      <br>
  In the face of decreasing available time, I found all of these factors together
  led to me dropping SEEPP from my &quot;active projects&quot; list.</p>
<p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate by
  email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, or by informal
  conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> I monitored the se-ethics e-mail list, but rarely if
  ever posted to it. I had several phone conversations with Don Gotterbarn, and
  attended I think three
  face-to-face meetings.</p>
<p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better than the others?
  Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as best? Why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> The face-to-face meetings were the best for me. They
  focused my attention on SEEPP for the time I was there, for one thing. I enjoyed
  the direct interaction
  with my colleagues on the task force. Face-to-face is also better for coming
  to consensus or compromise positions than e-mail; people are typically a little
  less aggressive in person than when typing away by themselves at a computer.</p>
<p>E-mail wasn't effective for me; they either didn't happen for months at a
  time or else there were many long ones seemingly all at once that I never got
  around to reading. This is odd since I am often an avid reader and writer of
  e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant to the process?
  (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> I remember a telephone conference with an IEEE process
  guru that seemed to go on forever with no real benefit. SEEPP members familiar
  with the process
  guru engaged in quite a bit of eye-rolling.</p>
<p>I remember it was quite a long time from when Don invited me to participate
  until anything much seemed to happen. I remember long stretches between meetings
  where no one seemed to do much. But eventually, the group gelled and started
  actively drafting.</p>
<p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant to your participation
  in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> Yes, and yes, if I ever find them.</p>
<p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result of
    your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of ethics?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> A code of ethics can provide knowledge and guidance to
  new and experienced practitioners. It can provide a &quot;safe harbor&quot; for
  practitioners beyond which no one need tread. It can act as a reminder of higher
  aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially pleased
  with or unhappy about?</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>SB:</strong> I'm pleased I was able to improve
                      the Guide to Operations. I have some regret that I didn't
                      stick with the Task Force through the issuance of the first
                      version
  of the code. While I have some reservations about a few of the clauses, all
  in all it is an admirable document.</p>
<p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially pleased
  with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> I'm pleased that the code was actually completed and
  then adopted by both the ACM and the IEEE. There were times when it appeared
  that not much was going
  to happen.</p>
<p>I'm pleased that for the most part the code captures many values to which
  software engineers would naturally aspire.</p>
<p>I'm bothered that much of what has been written about the code claims that
  the code puts the welfare of the public as its first priority but that the
  code does not actually state this except in the preamble. Preambles are usually
  not enforceable.</p>
<p>I'm bothered that under the code a software engineer is required to report
  to his employer about intellectual property violations. I have never worked
  for an employer or client that actually had all their software licensing in
  order, either intentionally or unintentionally. Including such an unenforceable
  provision that automatically makes many practitioners unethical seems to me
  to undermine the authority and reasonableness of the code more than it would
  admonish or instruct the practitioners (who would for the most part be unemployable
  should they actually conform to the code in this matter).</p>
<p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems to you
    especially important? Explain</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> I think Don Gotterbarn was really the driving force behind
  the code effort, and ultimately kept it moving when the task force's momentum
  appeared to be
  slacking off.</p>
<p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, would you
  have done differently?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? Anything
    you want to add to what you have already said? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SB:</strong> No.</p>
