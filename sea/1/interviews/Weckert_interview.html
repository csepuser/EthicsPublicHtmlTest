      <p> <strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> (Summary) Undergraduate major in history and later
        a Diploma in Computer  Science, MA and PhD in Philosophy. </p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> (Summary) University. Teach in the Information
        Technology Discipline&#8212;Primarily 
        technical issues such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Communications,
         and Computer Ethics</p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you to that field?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> None. I do not consider software development
        as a strength of  mine...Oh, I was involved in the development of a decision
        support system 
        for vitraculture program that is being sold professionally.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> I am not an engineer.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice 9SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> I Met Don [Gotterbarn] at a meeting [1994?]. He
        told me about  it. Work had already been going on for some time.</p>
      <p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p>[No answer]</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> I am familiar with the ACS Code. I have only looked
        at codes in  the computing area. My knowledge of them is gotten primarily
        from teaching 
        and a little from work with ACS.</p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s Work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the Code?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> I got in late. I remember commenting on one of
        the drafts [version  3?]. I do not know if people took notice. It is
        hard to keep enthusiasm 
        when physically removed from the project.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or phone, or though face-to-face meetings, or by letter, or 
        by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW: </strong>Email.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW: </strong>I can only answer hypothetically because I only
        worked through  email. I think face-to-face works better. You accomplish
        more in one hour 
        face-to-face then in many hours of email.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong>(Not response to question, but a comment)<strong> </strong>The
        Code is primarily  a US document. It started off as an ACM-IEEE document.
        The IEEE says it&#8217;s 
        an international organization but it always seemed American to me. Don
         [Gotterbarn] is now working to make the Code international.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>11. Any events that particularly stick out in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more detail the better)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW: </strong>I have a very vague recollection
        of strong disagreements. I do not remember what they were about. I only
        read about them in email.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>12. What comments did you make?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> Maybe about accountability and responsibility.</p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> I think about the roles of codes now. Not 100%
        clear why we should  bother having them? I think more about professions
        in the software development 
        (maybe more about it since I know Don).</p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p>(Summary)-What a professional body claims is important; gives profession 
        credibility. Teaching Code gives you something to hang your hat on. With 
        a code, it is not just an academic making claims. The code could be used 
        in licensing. One person was kicked out of the ACS for Code violations; 
        codes influence behavior of those in the profession. A code is a guide 
        to behavior. </p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        please or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> (Summary) Pleased-nothing special. Disappointed
        about amount of own participation. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> (Summary) Unhappy? Nothing. Happy? I like this
        code better then the ACS  Code. The ACS Code only has short sections.
        The SE code is detailed, more 
        focused. Upfront it mentions groups. But I have not looked closely at
         it recently.</p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> Don-maybe you Michael [Davis] I don&#8217;t know-
        Simon [Rogerson].</p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> To tell you more about the Code? [John Weckert
        did not have a  list of which interviewers were already going to talk
        to. - DG] From the 
        ACS [Australian Computer Society], talk with John Hughes, John Ridge
        the  president, and Henry Maynard. In Melbourne. These are IT folks.
        Andrew 
        Alexandria [Philosophy department, University of Melbourne] knows a lot
         about codes. <br>
        <strong><br>
        19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, would 
        you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> That is a hard question to answer. My participation
        was not great.  In retrospect, I think it would have been good to have
        had more formal 
        involvement of other societies early on, not just the involvement of
        people  who were in those societies [IEEE-CS and ACM]</p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything to add to what you have already said?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JW:</strong> Can&#8217;t think of anything.<br>
      </p>
