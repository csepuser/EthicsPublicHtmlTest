      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> This is an interview with Michael Davis recorded at the Center
        for Urban Research and Learning, Chicago&#8230;Loyola University of Chicago,
        on May 13, 2006.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Okay, I&#8230; This is an interview with Michael Davis. Could
        you tell us a bit about your educational background?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> B.A. in Philosophy, Western Reserve University. Ph.D. in Philosophy,
        University of Michigan, 1972. One year of law school, University of Michigan,
        1976-77.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Did you do ethics from the beginning?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> I started out being interested in ethics. Ended up being talked
        into political philosophy by Richard Brandt, an important ethics person,
        and did my dissertation in political philosophy, social contract theory,
        which was then popular because of the Right to Revolution. And then for
        a while worked in political philosophy, and then slowly drifted into
        the philosophy of law and then into&#8230;did a little bit of legal ethics,
        and then philosophy of law, and then professional ethics.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> So how long have you been doing professional ethics?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Well really since 1974-75, when I taught a course in legal ethics
        at Case Western Reserve&#8217;s Law School. Western Reserve University
        was an early starter of medial ethics. They started like &#8217;64, &#8217;63,
        and by the time I went back there to teach in the philosophy department
        they had a, one of the major programs in medical ethics. And then as
        a result of Watergate, the medical ethics people got a call from the
        [CWRU] law school asking them for a course in legal ethics. And nobody
        in the philosophy department did legal ethics so they called in the most
        junior person in the department and said that, &#8220;You ought to go
        over to the law school and teach this course in legal ethics.&#8221; And
        I said that I knew a little bit about law, and a little bit about ethics,
        but nothing about legal ethics. And my chairman, who had been my mentor
        when I was an undergraduate, said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re smart. You&#8217;ll
        learn.&#8221; So then I became interested in legal ethics. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Alright, so when did you come to IIT?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> I arrived at IIT in 1986. I&#8217;d been teaching for seven long
        years in central Illinois, at Illinois State, and then had been denied
        tenure. And spent a year under a National Institute for Humanities&#8230;National
        Endowment for Humanities grant [and a year teaching philosophy at UIC]
        and then was about to go back to law school and finish up at Chicago
        when Bob Ladenson suggested that I instead might like to come to the
        Ethics Center.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Just about the title, the Ethics Center, the Center for the&#8230;?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions. And they had
        met me a couple years earlier because of a paper on conflict of interest,
        which they liked. And then I&#8217;d read a paper&#8230;while I was on
        my National Endowment for Humanities year I had read a paper there on
        codes of ethics, which they were interested in and had nobody who knew
        anything about. So that was their interest. And they pieced together
        some money and offered me a senior research fellow position, senior research
        associate position. And I didn&#8217;t really want to go to law school
        and my wife was just starting legal practice and was therefore making
        lots of money and I wanted to stay in Chicago so I did it.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> So that became a regular position somewhat?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis: </strong>Yeah. They were able to keep the line for a while and fully funded.
        And I sort of settled into the university, I guess people liked me. And
        then we had a, in the middle &#8216;90s, we had a provost who was kind
        of autocratic. He had some good ideas and some bad ideas. One of his
        good ideas was to make me a professor. He broke some rules; I shouldn&#8217;t
        have been eligible for tenure because I was not on a tenure track, I
        was on this research line. But he sent me, my name, to the various faculty
        committees and my credentials were fine and I had been teaching all along
        so they just did it. So I went from being denied tenure as an assistant
        professor to being a non-professor to being a full professor without
        ever being an associate professor.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> But you got interested in some engineers or working with engineers,
        or software, I guess separately.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Engineers&#8230;the IIT people, one of the reasons
        they&#8217;re
        interested in codes of ethics is they wanted to do a module, like a 60
        page or 80 page free standing unit, for teaching ethics on, codes of
        ethics. They also wanted to do one on conflict of interest. So they asked
        me first to do, to save a conflict of interest one that was falling apart.
        One of the&#8230;The philosopher involved with it had committed suicide,
        had thrown himself out of the 18th floor of the tallest building in Nebraska,
        the place where the philosophy department was located. And it was a mess.
        The document was a mess so I just rewrote it and they liked that. So
        they just&#8230;that&#8217;s why they invited me to come. But that was
        my first contact with engineers. I had, I had a friend in high school
        who became an engineer. But I had really no idea what they did, absolutely
        none. And this particular case involved lots of documents that allowed
        me see what they were doing and it was, for someone who was interested
        in law what it struck me was how much like legal work it was. There were
        lots of documents. They were producing documents. They were analyzing
        documents. The documents concern physical things rather than legal concept
        but it was surprisingly similar. And there was the usual politics involved
        in the professional relationships. It was quite familiar in that respect.
        So I thought, &#8220;You know, I understand these guys.&#8221; And apparently
        the engineers thought I did too.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> So when was the first time you started to look at software
        development? Was that when you got involved in this project?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Yes. Well actually, no. As it turns out, I had a run in with
        software earlier, but it was a plagiarism case in the history of computing.
        And I was interested in the failure to attribute discovery of a famous
        lost letter. And the article had been eventually published in the Annals
        of the History of Computing, which is an IEEE journal, it is now. It
        was edited by somebody who later became an ACM president. And it involved
        a number of people who it turns out were important in software engineering.
        But I was, at the time I was studying [it], this was the early &#8216;90s,
        I was just studying the attempt by some unknown math guy to get his discovery
        acknowledged even though it had been used. And I wrote a couple papers
        on that. And at the time I hadn&#8217;t realized it was connected with
        the software world. I only realized [that] when I, when this project
        started and I began seeing some of the same names again. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> So when did you hear about the IEEE/ACM joint task force on
        software engineering and professional practice?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> I would have to go look at my book to tell you for sure but I
        think it was like January 2, 1993 or 1992, whatever the appropriate year
        is. And it was Vivian&#8230; I generally don&#8217;t have any good ideas
        for grants. Vivian has them. And she had this one. She asked me what
        I thought. And I thought, &#8220;Writing a code of ethics sounds interesting.
        I like codes of ethics.&#8221; But that was the first time&#8230;I asked
        her what software engineering was. She didn&#8217;t know either but she
        said, &#8220;We teach it. There are courses in the computer science department.
        So we should find out. Why they&#8217;re not in the engineering school
        I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; That was&#8230;what I do remember, I don&#8217;t
        remember the year, but I remember that it was [an] absolutely clear January
        day. It was really blue skies, bright, bright sun in Chicago. I was looking
        out the windows as I talked to her.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> So the actual grant to study the process was really the first,
        well inviting the grant was the really first step&#8230;?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Yeah, for me. I hadn&#8217;t&#8230;I wasn&#8217;t clear why they
        thought they needed a separate code of ethics. Why not the engineering
        ones? Why not the ACM one? But they were doing that. I wasn&#8217;t clear
        who they were or how many they were. It [&#8220;software engineering&#8221;]
        was a new term to me.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> They had just started at that point. Was the grant kind of
        co-terminus with the process or was it like already well under way when
        you got the grant written to study it? </p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> We thought that it was well on its way when we asked for a one-year
        grant to study it. We thought we were going to come in on its climax.
        As it turned out we did a SGRE grant, like a couple months to get the
        money. And almost nothing happened during the two months we were waiting
        for the grant. And then by the time some things did happen, set up their
        committees and so on, in the year that followed and during that we submitted
        the big grant. But we expected things to move a lot faster then they
        did for reasons that are in retrospect are not clear since a lot of the
        codes have long histories, long gestation periods.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> But what kind of&#8230;you mentioned that you&#8217;d done
        some code, that you&#8217;d been interested in codes of ethics before
        this program&#8230;?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Well actually I have been drafting for a long time. I recently,
        on a website, came across University of Michigan student government&#8230;Michigan
        Student Association constitution, the current one, and the last section
        of it is a bill of rights which I had written in 1968. Twenty-six items
        still there, untouched. So I&#8217;d done drafting in grad school. Mostly
        house rules, some constitutions for the student governments. Like the
        undergrad student government called me in as a consultant. And lots of
        legislation. And then I was just interested in codes of ethics but I
        hadn&#8217;t had an opportunity to write one for a long time. So, but
        then I did do an article in which I&#8230; Well first, there&#8217;s
        the City of Chicago&#8217;s code of ethics. I came in on the very end
        of that drafting but I made some suggestions for arrangement and headings
        and so on to make it easier to use. I&#8217;m really more interested
        in the form of codes of ethics than the substance. And so I like to have
        as many titles as possible so people can find things, and I think the
        order is important, and clarity, clarity of language. So I commented
        a little on that one. I wrote kind of model code of ethics for an article
        on civic responsibility. And I also wrote a model provision for when
        police should be allowed to take people out of other countries, an article
        [on] criminal justice ethics. So I&#8217;d done, I&#8217;d been thinking
        about the problems of drafting, and structure, and the use of code as
        a form, as a way of analyzing ethical problems. Putting in line which &#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> When one thinks of a grant to study something else there&#8217;s
        normally a clear distinction between the people doing the studying and
        the people who are studying all these traditions, if that is the case.
        I gather that wasn&#8217;t the case necessarily all the whole way through
        this process. </p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> No, we were kind of participant-observers, was our idea. And
        these are philosophers who are thinking about participant-observers and
        not anthropologists. So we, I didn&#8217;t have the vaguest idea what
        we were getting into&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> So did the grant itself specify that you were going to help
        write the code of ethics?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Yes, it did.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Whalley:</strong> Oh, okay, I didn&#8217;t realize that.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> I had forgotten that for a while. It definitely is in the grant.
        And we were well situated to do that. The people who we worked with didn&#8217;t
        realize that we would be useful. Gotterbarn never asked for help from
        us on the things that he should of and we didn&#8217;t tell him. We were
        too modest.<br>
        There is in philosophy a recent analog of what we did as participant-observer,
        active participant. There&#8217;s a guy at&#8212;Hall, David Hall&#8212;at
        Northwestern who was interested in a debate in science between two kinds
        of students of species. And in the course of his observations he became
        president of the association. So with that as a model, and that was where,
        because he presented a paper at one point [at IIT] about what he had
        done. I, we actually felt very comfortable being active participants
      and also keeping the records. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Okay, so the idea was to participate as professional ethicist
        but also to be, keep the records so they&#8217;d be safe for later.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Right. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Okay so that&#8217;s interesting.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> And we told Gotterbarn and I believe, although I&#8217;ve never
        been able to find the email he sent, I believe he sent out an email notifying,
        welcoming us and notifying everyone that we&#8217;d be studying them.
        But that email I haven&#8217;t found. But in any case everyone forgot
        about that. There was notice, but one of the things I&#8217;ve learned
        about notice from this case is that it doesn&#8217;t [mean much], that
        even intelligent people, telling them from the beginning that you&#8217;re
        going to be there is not very helpful in protecting them.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> So what, how did you, apart from keeping the records which
        we&#8217;ll talk about later, what role did you actually play as participants
        in the process?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Well initially we didn&#8217;t do much of anything. We just read
        the mail. And that may be how we got in the habit of thinking of ourselves
        as just observers. No one asked us to do anything. Of course no one asked
        anybody really to do anything for a while. And when they asked for things
        they didn&#8217;t seem like things we should do. We had no agenda about
        what we wanted in the code of ethics. When they asked us what we thought
        should be in the code of ethics we didn&#8217;t say anything. It was
        initially&#8230;we just became passive.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> So at what point did you stop being passive, or did you?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Well, I stopped being passive as an individual when Mechler asked
        for, not provisions that we wanted in the code, but provisions that should
        go into a code or that we might want to consider putting into a code.
        He had some way of asking the question which seemed more open and at
        the right level. So I read first through what other people had done and
        then once it was clear where the range of suggestions were going, suggested
        a few things that I thought might be, that they had overlooked. So I
        was making use of my kind of second order&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Can you say what kinds of things were&#8230;?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Oh, I think an environmental clause was one. I&#8217;ve forgotten
        what the other&#8230; there was another one. There&#8217;s actually,
        those memos exist. But they were not really high controversy things.
        They just more kind of helped.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Were you treated by the other members as just another member
        or did they respond differently to what you&#8217;d suggested then they
        would have to others?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> As far as I could tell, initially, we got no special treatment.
        And Mechler seemed to slowly develop a respect for the IIT people as
        he got to know them from what we wrote him. He had no awe in advance
        either.<br>
      Whalley: Was it by email or letter?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Email, fax, and occasionally, in the early days, even postal
        mail. I think never by phone.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> And never in person?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Not until, I had never meet him until I interviewed him. In fact,
        I had never met any of the people until I interviewed them. I mean the
        main people, except Gotterbarn, I knew him earlier. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Was that the last time you contributed or was there&#8230;?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> No, actually that was the first time. And then as I mention in
        the book, there was this visit to Chicago by Mechler in which he asked
        me to do a first draft of the actual code because he was afraid if I
        didn&#8217;t nobody else would. He had all these ideas, what we now call
        version 0, and he wanted it to be put into a coherent whole, and a coherent
        whole is actually what I was best at.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Was that after the interviews or before the interview?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Before the interviews. This is actually; this is the first time
        I meet him. And the last time I met him until the interview. So I did
        meet him once.<br>
        So I did. I put the code in shape and he liked it. So that became Version
        1. There were some revisions. There was a process of working through
        the draft for clarity which was done by a committee at IIT, a kind of
        nice polishing that they did. But that was the first draft. And I was
      not into the substance; I was really doing the form.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Was that again sent out by email?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Yep, those sent out by email. Well, Mechler sent them out by
        email. My drafts, I think, went to him mostly through fax until finally
        I sent him a disk version which then he used for sending&#8230; This
        would have been in 1995 so the attachments system was pretty primitive.
        Even a document that size could well jam somebody&#8217;s mailbox.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley: </strong>So the first draft went out, what happened? What was your participation
        after that?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> There were&#8230; basic, there was some discussion about particular
        items, I&#8217;ve forgot the details but they&#8217;re in the book. And
        then in September he announced it done and sent out the final one, sent
        it to ACM, to Gotterbarn, and to everyone else he thought should get
        it. And he&#8217;s ready to go out of business. You understand, he&#8217;s
        this subcommittee that sort of appears spontaneously when nothing&#8217;s
        happening. And he was actually in more contact with Gotterbarn than we
        realized at the time but he just came from nowhere. He announced his
        presence in March and we were, by that point, we were afraid the whole
        thing was going to go down the tubes and we would have nothing to show
        for all our money. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley: </strong>He got the first draft done? And then what? What for you? I
        know what happened.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> We kind of went back, I went back into my watching mode. And
        from then on things pretty much went on their own. I expected Gotterbarn
        at some point to ask somebody to do a draft like Mechler had, but Gotterbarn
        did it himself. And there are some things about his draft I like and
        some things I don&#8217;t like. But he did it himself. And then near
        the end I wrote in because there were some really awful things about
        clarity or organization or sort of technical things that I thought should
        be taken care of.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Was there any sense during this process that they treated you,
        that they treated you differently because you were an &#8220;expert on
        ethics&#8221; as opposed to a practitioner of software. </p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> No, they had, as far as I could tell, absolutely no respect for
        experts in ethics or for philosophers.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Or lack of respect.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Or lack of respect.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> I mean it wasn&#8217;t the opposite. Did they treat you the
        same as if you were a software developer?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> I think they basically, Mechler treated us pretty much the way
        he treated everybody else. The people who worked got credit, and got
        more work, and those who didn&#8217;t, didn&#8217;t. Gotterbarn, I don&#8217;t
        think, he didn&#8217;t know I had done the draft until very late in the
        process. Maybe not until after his work was complete. And so he didn&#8217;t
        have a basis for judgement, and he knew me as a philosopher. He didn&#8217;t
        know much about what I did in professional ethics. And he was happy to
        have us on his committee, he was always happy to have people on the committee,
        but he never came to us for anything. So I think, you know, it&#8217;s
        a good example of the absence of authority. We were so afraid of poisoning
        the process by thrusting ourselves in, and overwhelming these people
        who were inexperienced and who would, who overly held us in high esteem&#8212;and
        they could care less. So if I were to do something like that again I
        would be less concerned about that participant-observer problem. It may
        be one thing when you&#8217;re a westerner in a native village or something
        or working with poor people. Although it may be that the anthropologists
        overestimate the authority they carry but with people with PhDs and advanced
        degrees and high office in various organizations and lots of experience
        with the world and so on it doesn&#8217;t matter very much. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> So next time you&#8217;d recommend going in just as the expert,
        I mean if you weren&#8217;t recording? In other words&#8230; </p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Yeah.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Exactly as if they&#8217;d put
        you on a committee.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> I would tell them I was keeping records and had this intention
        to write a book later but I wouldn&#8217;t worry about poisoning the
        atmosphere. They&#8217;ll pick what they want and ignore the rest. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Did they&#8230;you said they ignored, or didn&#8217;t give
        you respect as an expert. Did the fact that they knew you were also recording
        and writing a book make a difference?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> No, because they forgot it. That was one of the striking things,
        among the failures of memory, is that everybody, even Gotterbarn, vaguely
        knew we were there. With these claims&#8212;he said things in emails
        that he might not have said if he had realized we were keeping them.
        And then he has been trying to get me to leave out these really pungent
        lines ever since. So I think, if you want to protect your sources, you
        probably have to remind them regularly that you&#8217;re there or they&#8217;ll
        forget. It&#8217;s probably better to go over and negotiate, which is
        what we did with Gotterbarn, negotiate what we would use and wouldn&#8217;t
        use afterwards. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> And as you generally thought the general statement earlier
        that you were keeping a record wasn&#8217;t something he remembered or&#8230; Was
        that because it took so long with the process?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Memory is selective, and people, that&#8217;s not something people
        really care that much about because you don&#8217;t look like you&#8217;re
        doing anything when you&#8217;re listening and it doesn&#8217;t have
        an immediate effect. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Was that also, though, because you had a role? That you could
        have been there even if you weren&#8217;t keeping a record? Where if
        I was a sociologist, I wouldn&#8217;t be there except to keep a record.
        While you&#8217;re an expert on ethics which they could well have asked.
        Forget your record keeping and all, I mean, you could have been enrolled
        as a member in all of this.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> You don&#8217;t look like a sociologist; you look like another
        computer science person. I mean you don&#8217;t have something written
        across your forehead. If you had a caste mark, that might do it. But
        apart from that I think&#8230;That&#8217;s one of the things that struck
        me during the interviews is how people who&#8217;d I&#8217;d pictured
        as different looked like people in my department or people you go to
        conferences with. The line between computer scientist and academic is
        not very sharp to being with. The age group, recently people who were
        doing all this stuff was similar, and their academic training was similar
        and some of them were actually undergraduate philosophers which was another
        surprise. There were a surprising number of them. There aren&#8217;t
        that many&#8230;there are a lot more undergraduate sociologists than
        there are undergraduate philosophers. And there were a number of them
        in this group and that&#8217;s another thing that undercuts the sense
        of difference. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> And also a lot of this stuff that you were collecting wasn&#8217;t
        stuff that was done in an interview. It&#8217;s one thing to remember
        you&#8217;re being interviewed, it&#8217;s another thing to remember
        that somebody&#8217;s keeping your emails that you&#8217;ve sent.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Right. And the emails are interesting because the conventions
        for handling it were developed as we were collecting them. And people
        now might be more cautious than they were in the early days of email
        where you were happy your email got sent off to begin with. And the government
        had not yet begun seizing the emails and using them in court. So the
        rules may have changed. In fact it&#8217;s too bad no one has done a
        time segmented study of the conventions to see in what they have changed
        in those 10 years. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Although given the things that people accidentally release
        to the web sometimes you realize that people actually don&#8217;t remember
        their employers are keeping track of this. </p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> It&#8217;s true. There are an awful lot of mistakes.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Do you think it would, the code would have been different if
        you weren&#8217;t a participant.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Yes. I am pretty sure it wouldn&#8217;t have had those key words
        because that was my special contribution to the code writing. I think
        they, the preamble would have been a little different. Most of the preamble
        is now Gotterbarn&#8217;s anyway but there&#8217;s still one paragraph
        which is basically mine. And the numbering and the organization, the
        organization is changed somewhat; they moved a lot of my nice little
        features. It&#8217;s still a relatively easy document to use and that
        was my contribution. There are ones which are similar in one-way or another
        but I pulled it together. So it would have been different. It also would
        have been quite different if Gotterbarn hadn&#8217;t done it. As to the
        provisions, I think 90% of them would have been the same whether Gotterbarn
        had written the code or not. And maybe 98% or 99% would have been similar
        apart from variations in language if I hadn&#8217;t written them.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> So that&#8217;s more the form.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Just the form, yeah. And to some degree the choice of words.
        My documents have a, seem to have their own style. People can recognize
        it</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> I&#8217;m going to skip over questions 14
        and ask it near the end, which is the one about what is in your opinion
        is important about the code. I think we can have that discussion for
        many hours. Anything
        about your participation that you&#8217;re especially pleased with or
        happy with at this point looking back?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Well like everybody else involved with the project the thing
        I&#8217;m happiest about is that there was a code that came out of it.
        In the course of writing that one, I&#8217;d have seen most of them that
        got written, I ran across a number of them that didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m
        more aware, it&#8217;s like childbirth. When you&#8217;re pregnant everyone
        tells you how wonderful childbirth is and then if you have, in this case
        my wife, had a bad childbirth, then people who hadn&#8217;t say anything
        before who you&#8217;ve talk to many times then tell you their story
        about how bad their childbirth was. Dead codes are like that, you don&#8217;t
        hear about them until you&#8217;ve had trouble with yours. So that was
        the first thing. I think it has a lot of features that will be copied
        or at least people will think about before they do their own draft, both
        in choice of wording, in the substance of some provisions, in the organization,
        and the organization of this. This definitely seems to be, for the technical
        people, a major code. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Anything you regret about your involvement?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Yes, that I didn&#8217;t tell Gotterbarn much earlier, that I
        didn&#8217;t advertise. I would have liked to get my hands on the code
        and prevented him from making some mistakes that he made. I think the
        biggest mistake, the one I&#8217;ve liked to have prevented, is&#8212;I
        would have liked to keep the preamble short and he has these principle
        interpretations that I really like but I would have put them at the back
        where they don&#8217;t get in the way of the reader looking at the provisions.
        And I&#8217;d also have standardized his wording so you don&#8217;t get
        slightly different wording in various provisions which confuses interpretation.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Do you think you he would have taken your advice?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Who knows. He&#8217;s&#8230; I always liked him and he&#8217;s
        actually pretty easy to work with most of the time. He does have a temper.
        He does exaggerate. And on a few things he can be stubborn. But usually
        he&#8217;s quite easy to work with. So I imagine that the suggestions
        to him might have made a difference. He&#8217;s not a prima donna.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Is there anything about the final code that you&#8217;re especially
        pleased with or happy about?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Well then: unhappiness is there are variations in wording in
        different provisions where the terms mean exactly the same thing and
        I would have liked to keep the wording consistent throughout. I also
        would have organized it a little differently. The original order of the
        sections was logical. It began with the product and then went on to the
        people, and the organization, and finally the individual&#8217;s sort
        of life activity. It got rearranged to put the public first even though
        you&#8217;re not yet explaining what it is you&#8217;re working on. It&#8217;s
        doesn&#8217;t change [substance], it&#8217;s kind of a cosmetic change
        which makes it harder to use the document or less&#8230; Well I believe
        less intuitive but it turns out no body notices. Well so it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> One of the questions here is about the people
        whose participation in the process seem especially important to you.
        Looking back over the
        process is there anything that stands out to you that didn&#8217;t get
        included in your final text?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> No, not. The two big people, Gotterbarn was definitely a necessary
        person. If he hadn&#8217;t done it, it would have fallen apart. He kinda
        has the status of a George Washington of the process. And Mechler is
        just critical at a given moment. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s
        anybody in American history who&#8217;s quite like that, just comes in.
        Cincinnatus is the Roman equivalent, he just came in, did his stuff,
        and withdrew.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Why did he withdraw?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> He only got involved because he thought the thing was going to
        fall apart. And once it got going again he had other things to do, he&#8217;s
        trying to earn a living. There was a volatile period in software engineering;
        he held several jobs while the code was being written. In several different
        companies, some of which went out of existence. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> If you had been running the process what would you have done
        differently?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> I have no idea. It would have been&#8230;it&#8217;s very hard
        for me to imagine myself in that environment. I think the biggest thing
        I would not have done, I think Gotterbarn&#8217;s major mistake at the
        beginning was to try and split the work into parts and then draft, and
        then work his way back to a code. And I think one of the things I&#8217;ve
        learned about code writing, I have 17 lessons, right now. But I think
        one of the underlying things is that the code, the first draft should
        be written by one person. The ideas should be as widely collected as
        possible. Somebody has to sit down and do a first draft. No divide and
        conquer. You divide, you&#8230; That&#8217;s like dividing your forces
        in the presence of an enemy who&#8217;s location and the force you do
        not know. It&#8217;s suicide. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Was there any politics to this? A lot of what you describe
        is how long it took. <br>
        There were&#8212;I wouldn&#8217;t say inefficiencies, but the lack of
        centralized drive to get it done. But was there active resistance as
        opposed to just sort of, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t very important. I won&#8217;t
      be bothered to do it.&#8221;?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> No, the odd thing is that there didn&#8217;t seem to be, there
        were some people who had objections to kinds of codes who made their
        appearance like Mary Shaw but for the most part until the very end all
        the problems were problems of inertia and organization. There was no
        active opposition. And in fact the process for the most part was if you
        got a meeting or you got a vote you got overwhelming support. Your big
        problem was getting anything done. And to some degree that difficulty
        at the beginning may have helped with the approval process at the end
        because you got a sense of the work that went in, how hard it was to
        do, and how unlikely it was it would be tried again for another generation.
        I also think the opposition was a result of people who didn&#8217;t understand
        codes as they were. Some of Shaw&#8217;s problems are philosophical.
        They weren&#8217;t in the substance of the provisions. They were about
        whether it was too specific or too general, whether this belongs in a
        code, or in some other documents and so on. There was never a flat out
        opposition to codes of ethics and ideas in the code. &#8220;Good but
        not practical,&#8221; said by a professor of software. As opposed to
        somebody in business who had to used it.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> That&#8217;s a good point to ask you. Why do you think, what&#8217;s
        important about having codes?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> I think they&#8217;re really good for teaching, first. As a way
        of introducing students to the problems they&#8217;ll experience in,
        on the job. And also to the thinking that&#8217;s gone into those problems.
        So one of them is kind of resume of collective experience of the field,
        and for students it comes as a pleasant surprise that such a thing exists
        on ethics. I have been present with lawyers who&#8217;ve opened up their
        code of ethics and resolved a dispute between themselves over what to
        do based on a provision. It can guide practitioners if they use it. Lawyers
        have copies of their code of ethics in their drawer or on the shelf behind
        them. I&#8217;ve yet to see an engineer who does that.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Perhaps because lawyers are most used to taking
        their authority from the text, whereas for engineers that would be the
        last place they&#8217;d
        probably want to look. </p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Oh no, that&#8217;s one of the things I&#8217;ve learned that&#8217;s
        not true. There are manuals, the civil engineering handbook with 600-700
        pages of recipes that generally carry authority with engineers unless
        they know of something&#8217;s specifically wrong with it. And I have
        seen engineers pull codes like the IEEE standards book off the shelf
        to settle a dispute. But the [ethics] codes, so far I haven&#8217;t seen
        that done yet but once they know it maybe they&#8217;ll use it. <br>
  But it&#8217;s also a way of setting standards; this is the thing Gotterbarn
  missed in his list. And a lot of the early writing on code of ethics misses
  that they not only... We&#8217;re at Loyola so let me give you a natural law
  version of this. Aquinas distinguishes between the part of natural&#8212;those
  rules which are determined by natural law, like don&#8217;t kill, and those
  rules which are determinable under natural law, like driving on the left side
  of the road or the right side of the road. You have to do one or the other,
  but which is a matter of indifference. And I think on many questions a profession
  needs to make a decision about how to do things but choosing from a list of
  several options. And the codes of ethics on those questions settle what we,
  as a group, will do. We either will tolerate conflicts of interest or we won&#8217;t
  and which conflicts. We will make public statement of a certain kind. Of course
  we must be honest but will we be candid. Lawyers have no provision for candor
  in their code of ethics, neither do physicians, but engineers do, and the software
  engineering code has one also. Those are the kinds of questions that set a
  higher standard of morality and that&#8217;s one of the contributions of codes.
  And the discussion of those provisions usually gives you insight into the underlying
  commitments of the profession. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Did that go on?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> It went on to a small degree in our little discussion group which
        had&#8212;one or two of the three to five people involved were software
        engineers. It went on a little bit also in Gotterbarn&#8217;s triumvirate
        as far as we could tell and in some of the comments we received. But
        it went on far less than I would have thought from other committees I&#8217;ve
        been on which drafted other things.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Did you get a sense that this was a function of the communication
        process? I could imagine for example that practical discussions, which
        is what you&#8217;re talking about, tend to take place more actively
        in a face to fact context where people bounce them back then  they
        do in the much slower email process. </p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> I believe email is a thinner process than direct speech and maybe
        even than telephone. And I think that is just a fact of the difficulty
        of typing. So there&#8217;s a&#8230; We can talk as fast as we think
        most of the time; it&#8217;s very hard to type as fast as we think. Most
        of us can&#8217;t do that. And also it&#8217;s kind of an indeterminate
        audience so you&#8217;re not getting the feedback of facial expressions
        that drives you on in explanation. So I think those are drawbacks. And
        I don&#8217;t know what went on in the discussions Gotterbarn had in
        England where he had his little group. <br>
  But some things come through&#8212;like everybody agreed that the public comes
  first, which for engineers is pretty non-controversial. But it could have been
  controversial. Physicians don&#8217;t think that way and lawyers don&#8217;t
  think that way and lots of other people don&#8217;t, business people don&#8217;t.
  The question was what to do about that commitment. So there were some of those
  things. The big ideas actually appear there and they then appear in the document
  itself. And the discussion that Mary Shaw and whatever his name is from Texas
  [Dennis Frailey] was interesting because they were all worried about serving
  the public, then users, and the client and then they were arguing about what
  was best to do so. You could see the commitments even as a disputed one. So
  there are some places where it came out, but it wasn&#8217;t nearly as rich
  as we&#8217;d hope. And I thought that was pretty disappointing. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Anything of either the process or your involvement
        in it that you think we should keep a record of or would like to talk
        about?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Well, I will say, I believe Gotterbarn is holding back documents
        to avoid embarrassing certain people. He&#8217;s still active; he would
        have to be older and out of the ACM world before he&#8217;d release everything.
        And I think he&#8217;s tried to get me to say things about&#8230; Melford
        that is not in the evidence I have but he&#8217;s convinced of. And since
        he wasn&#8217;t present at the events himself anymore than I was, the
        only way he&#8217;d know these things is if people told him them orally
        or he had documents. And somehow I&#8217;m pretty sure he has or at least
        had documents. I wish that information came because at that point there
        wasn&#8217;t much contact by people through email.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Would this affect any of the substance of the discussion?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> No, it would clarify some of the personality problems, some of
        the personnel problems a little better. And there is this critical moment
        where the IEEE/ACM reorganized the committee to make it unified. One
        chair rather than two and that made it possible, in retrospect, seems
        to have it made it possible for Gotterbarn to do things he wouldn&#8217;t
        have otherwise, to take things into his own hands. And I would just like
        to have more of the full story of that. I feel that I&#8217;m just not
        getting the full story. And I&#8217;d also like to know more about why
        he left USC because given what he has said, it would have been enough
        from me. <br>
  I&#8217;m of the philosophical school of writing history which is that I assume
  all of the participants are rational until I hear otherwise and therefore think
  exactly as I do until I have reason to think otherwise. So if he tells a story
  that doesn&#8217;t make sense to me and I don&#8217;t see what about him is
  different, I don&#8217;t buy the story. And most people just tell me stories
  which sound right and he&#8217;s somehow doesn&#8217;t quite. And it doesn&#8217;t
  affect the main line&#8212;it&#8217;s just insight about him that I would have
  liked to have had.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley: </strong>You mention that one of the greater moments might have been
        the point at which the ACM and the IEEE were combining committees. </p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Combining chairs.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Combining chairs to make a single... Do you get any sense that,
        given the broader picture, was more than a personality, more than getting
        it done, it had more to do with politics in two organization&#8230;?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> The idea of having co-chairs was a way to recognize the equality
        of the organization. There is a history of co-chairs apparently in the
        IEEE/ACM. So it wasn&#8217;t the first time they did it. I don&#8217;t
        know how successful or unsuccessful that is. There is a history in political
        philosophy of, like the Spartans had two kings. The reason they had two
        kings was so they would rarely act. They would normally cancel each other
        out. And the Romans had a double kingship also and then two consuls for
        the same reason. So generally in political philosophy the rule of thumb
        is that if you want to inhibit conduct you want to have a plural executive.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Is that why the United States has four equal powers, or at
        least three?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> It has a single executive rather than, as many states had at
        the time, executive council. And the reason for that is so that they&#8217;d
        be more energetic. And the ACM if they wanted action from this committee
        probably&#8212;ACM/IEEE made a bad a bad mistake. In some cases they
        had chair and co-chair which, no problem, but with the consent of two
        parties [required you] to act you automatically slow the process. So
        I think that was probably a real mistake on their part. Whatever the,
        and I think the politics of it, in the least sense of politics, was simply
        they were trying to treat the two organizations equally, and as they
        began to trust each other more on this issues, they worried about that
        less. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> But you don&#8217;t think that this stems
        from the debate that&#8217;s been out, I was just reading an article
        about this, the debate about the issue of whether software engineers
        and computer scientists
        have those kinds of issues? The occupational definitional issue?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> The occupational definitional issue is a serious one. And one
        of the three bodies under the steering committee was concerned with defining
        that. It wasn&#8217;t our group; it was one of the others. And they took
        a long time working on it, working over the curriculum, which is not
        an engineering curriculums but it&#8217;s close. So that&#8217;s&#8212;it
        means they&#8217;re not going to be ABET accredited engineers.--And it,
        in the long run may end up that one day software engineering will be
        part of engineering, in part because the crucial difference right now
        seems to be thermodynamics. And the ACM&#8212;the ABET no longer requires
        thermodynamics because of the way it&#8217;s set up, its evaluation process.
        And a few schools, like the Electrical Engineering department at U of
        I &#8211; Champaign, schools that can get away with it, have dropped
        the thermodynamics requirement on the grounds that computers don&#8217;t
        really&#8230;., software doesn&#8217;t pay any attention to thermodynamics.
        It&#8217;s not really an issue.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Do you think this occupational debate, definitional
        debate had any impact on the ethics, the code of ethics issues?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Well, the only reason there is a software engineering code of
        ethics is that software engineering is not part of engineering. So I
        think the answer has to be yes. Otherwise, if it was clearly part of
        engineering then we might have done a sub-code. Which would have had
        a few provisions that were specialized but we wouldn&#8217;t have written
        a new code. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Do computer scientists have a code of ethics that&#8217;s different?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Yeah, the ACM code is the computer science code. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Is that significantly different from this one?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Yes, and Gotterbarn has that chart to prove it. And that was
        an issue because the other question was what was wrong with the ACM one.
        And the software engineering one has much more about process of design
        which is not a general issue.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> But on the kind of strictly ethical components, for example
        when you mentioned earlier that engineers have a candor clause and lawyers
        don&#8217;t. Did that kind of subjective differences, are there any&#8230;?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> I am not a great believer in the distinction between the truly
        ethical and the merely technical.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> I understand that, this is just for our discussion,
        but there is a sense in which there is stuff in there because there are
        certain
        processes that are discussed. They are different. Then there are certain
        kinds of issues about  whether the decision is a different kind of
        decision, whether practice has been decided. Left hand, right hand side
        has been
        decided
        differently.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Davis:</strong> I think that one of the features of the software engineering
          code that people don&#8217;t pay attention to&#8230; Most of the interesting
          provisions are actually in the product section. And one of them, there
          are a number about the importance of process of proceeding into the
          development of software engineering according to accepted processes.
          And that actually is, that was one of the things that Mary Shaw was
          very upset about because she thought there were no accepted processes.
          And I, and that&#8217;s a specifically, the ethics behind that is that
          if there is a way to produce reliable software, that&#8217;s it. Anything
          that uses procedures which haven&#8217;t been previously tested is
          going to introduce many problems which can be avoided. And so part
          of becoming an engineering field, that&#8217;s a field where your work
          is reliable, is keeping to the processes which you know work for the
          development of software, and making variations only when you have good
          reason, and then clearly documenting it. And that&#8217;s a highly
          technical concern but&#8230; That&#8217;s actually at the heart of
          the ethical commitment of software engineers, going back to the reason
      the term was coined.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> And that would be different say than computer scientists?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Oh yes. The computer scientists are not all that committed to
        process. That&#8217;s&#8212; they&#8217;re scientist. They&#8217;re more
        interested in truth. They&#8217;re more interested in experiment. They&#8217;re
        much freer spirits. If you hang around in a computer science department
        you will see the two groups split off in very&#8212;with a big fuzzy
        area. That&#8217;s a major split in the departments. At one end are the
        math people, who really aren&#8217;t application-oriented at all, and
        the other end are people who are really application-oriented, that&#8217;s
        the software part.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Was this group that produces software, were they already developing
        a consensus that engineering was different from computer science, was
        different from math in this way that you are talking about? Or did they
        struggle to find out? </p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> They were clear about this difference between math and software
        engineering. Even if, even though, most of the people who were computer
        scientists had begun as math people, and then moved into applications
        and then into software engineering, in particular. And they had, whatever
        their historical connections to the math department they were clear they
        had at some point made the choice. And I must say IIT at one point; remember
        I mentioned that provost who did some things which were good and some
        things which were bad? One of the worst choices he ever made was he looked
        at the math department, saw how small it was, it was an applied math
        department, and said, &#8220;Well applied math, computer science, basically
        the same thing,&#8221; and put them in one department to save administrative
        expenses. And they hated each other because applied math is not, has
        very little in common with computer science. I don&#8217;t quite understand
        why not but they didn&#8217;t, and as soon as he left they split. So
        on that side, people when they make their choice to go into computer
        science application are aware that they&#8217;re no longer mathematicians.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> But this group, the people who responded, they already were
        clear that a software engineering code of ethics needed to include the
        process, reliability stuff that say the computer science code of ethics
        doesn&#8217;t include?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Ninety-some percent when they did a ballot approved those provisions,
        and many of them [the provisions] got 98-99%. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> But during the process of creating them, before the ballots.
        I mean the discussions that you followed and interviews. Were those issues
        that were discussed or they were just like taken for granted assumptions
        because that&#8217;s what software engineers do?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> Mary Shaw was useful because she did not accept that. She agreed
        that when software engineering is really a field of engineering it will
        have those procedures. She just denied that the procedures existed. So
        she accepted the underlying picture of what software engineering would
        be. She&#8217;s kinda like a Hegelian, I guess, or Marxist. But we hadn&#8217;t
        reached the revolution yet. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> But was her role to be anything other than
        be a maverick? I mean did she create support? Or did this lead to serious
        discussion? Or that&#8217;s
        just Mary Shaw doing her Mary Shaw thing.</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> No she&#8230; It led to serious discussion,
        that is other people picked up on it and eventually led to a report later
        in the process after
        the code was approved, which scuttled, short changed the process inside
        the ACM. So she&#8217;s not an insignificant voice but what I think is
        interesting about her voice is not so much that she was politically disruptive,
        but that her picture of what software engineering should be was the same
        as everybody else&#8217;s. And her dispute was a factual question, or
        a quasi-factual question, about what resources are available now. And
        the other side, including Mechler, agrees that the processes that are
        in place now are not that good. He just believes that the results of
        following those processes are substantially better than not following
        them, and therefore it&#8217;s the state-of-the-art and you should use
        them until you get better, which is a typical engineering approach to
        a problem. And he&#8217;s the practical guy and she&#8217;s the academic.
        And hostility to the process stuff came mostly from academics or from
        high-level researchers, say like whatever the name of that laboratory
        in upstate New York I went to, not Bell Labs but&#8230;I&#8217;ve forgotten
        the name now. They were really again very theoretical and so they thought
        the processes weren&#8217;t good enough and therefore it... The people
        inside those organizations are surprised, are embarrassed about how divided
        they are on all these subjects. And as an outsider coming in I thought
        the differences were very small, and often in terms of these factual
        questions, or quasi-factual questions. And so for me they look like a
        normal profession, not like a nascent profession.</p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Anything else you want to add?</p>
      <p><strong>Davis:</strong> No, that&#8217;s about it. That&#8217;s more than I thought I&#8217;d
        have to say when I came down here. </p>
      <p><strong>Whalley:</strong> Well, thanks. <br>
