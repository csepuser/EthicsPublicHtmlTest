      <p><strong>BW:</strong> Let me begin by repeating 
        what I told you on the phone. I was a member of the ACM [Association
        of Computing Machinery] Council when the question came up of making software
        engineering a profession. I think that was in 1992. I remember the discussions.
        It seemed like a &#8220;no brainer&#8221;. Of course we should go ahead.
         That&#8217;s how I voted. I think we received reports on the progress
         of  the project after that. But in 1996 I became President of the National
         Academy 
        of Engineering (NAE); at the time the NAE was having a very difficult
         time  and I had to devote 25 hours/day to resolving its problems. So,
         from then 
        on I have no notes recording anything having to do with the project.
         No  memory either. And, given how busy I have been since, I think the
         absence 
        of notes and memory probably fairly represents my involvement. I hope
         you  won&#8217;t feel that you have wasted your time. </p>
      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> B.S. in Engineering Physics (University of Illinois,
        Champaign-Urbana),  1961, from the Engineering School. M.A. in Electrical
        Engineering, 1963, 
        also from UIUC. Ph.D. in Computer Science, 1968, from the University
        of  Virginia. </p>
      <p>I was captivated by computers in the first semester of my senior year, 
        and my life took an abrupt 90 degree turn. At the time there was no Computer 
        Science Dept. at Illinois, so I thought EE was the way to do what interested 
        me. But by the time I had my master&#8217;s degree, however, I realized 
        that straight EE at Illinois at that time was not what I wanted.</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> Together with its siblings, the National Academy
        of Sciences and the  Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Engineering
        (NAE) has two 
        purposes. One is to serve as an honorific organization with about 2000
         members. To be elected to the NAE is the highest honor that can be bestowed
        
        on an engineer by one&#8217;s peers. Only about one in a thousand engineers
         is so honored. The other purpose of the NAE is to advise the government
        
        on issues in science and technology. The Academies have served both purposes
         since the NAS was established in 1863 by act of Congress. </p>
      <p>I&#8217;m the President. That&#8217;s an elected office with a term of 
        six years. I&#8217;m in my second term. My job has two parts corresponding 
        to the NAE&#8217;s two purposes. First, I run a membership organization. 
        Second, I help oversee a staff of about 1200. Mostly, the staff helps 
        the advisory panels do their work. We publish about one advisory report 
        every working day. Each report&#8212;each of the books on those shelves 
        is a report&#8212;is an assignment from the government. Each is done under 
        a contract we negotiate for that study. Overall the Academies&#8217; budget 
        is about $250 million a year &#8211; almost all of which comes from contracts 
        to do these reports.</p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> A lot of experience. I began my career as an academic
        at Carnegie-Mellon  University. I wrote a number of large programs, for
        example, I designed 
        the Bliss programming language and wrote the compiler for it that Digital
         Equipment Corporation (DEC) used for writing system software (now HP
        uses 
        it, of course). I also wrote the Hydra operating system for a 16-processor
         multi-processor computere. Besides exploring the implications of multiprocessing,
        
        Hydra tested some novel ideas in computer security.</p>
      <p>I met and worked with Mary Shaw and Mario Barbacci while at CMU. In those 
        days, computer science was still a small field. It was easy to know almost 
        everyone who did anything at all important.</p>
      <p>Later I founded and ran a company of my own, Tartan Laboratories, that 
        did compiler development. We specialized in what are called &#8220;optimizing 
        compilers&#8221; &#8211; one that translate programs in higher level languages 
        like C into very efficient machine code. Tartan was sold to TI in the 
        mid 90&#8217;s. The technology for this came out of my work at CMU.</p>
      <p>I have done some hardware work as well &#8211; mostly at the computer 
        architecture level. I was a consultant to DEC on the design of the PDP-11, 
        and was the principal architect of C.mmp, the 16-processor multiprocessor 
        mentioned above &#8211; C.mmp was the largest, shared memory multiprocessor 
        computer of its time. More recently at Virginia my students and I have 
        worked on memory architecture issues having to do with the poor performance 
        of caches on vector-like memory accesses. One of my two patents is the 
        result of this work (the other is for the architecture of a really novel 
        computer that, unfortunately, was never built.)</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> Down to my toes. I was trained as an engineer,
        of course, but beyond  that, I think the term &#8220;computer science&#8221; misleads
        people  into thinking it is a scientific discipline. In reality CS consists
        of 
        a spectrum of activities that span from some very deep mathematics to
         some very practical engineering &#8211; and my work has mostly been
         at  the engineering end of the spectrum (my deviations had to do with
         the 
        formal semantics of programming languages and proofs of correctness of
          programs).</p>
      <p>I love von Karmen&#8217;s observation that science is about understanding 
        nature, but engineering is about creating what never was. Both my academic 
        research and my company&#8217;s products were all about &#8220;creating 
        what never was&#8221;, creating what solved a very real, practical problem.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> By helping to set it up. I was one of the members
        of the ACM council  that joined with the IEEE to set up the Joint Task
        Force.</p>
      <p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> As far as I can recall, I didn&#8217;t participate
        at all. Certainly,  I didn&#8217;t do any significant SEEPP work after
        July 1996 when I came  to the NAE. I had more than enough work here.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> I had read the ACM code of ethics. I have read
        much more extensively  since, however. I plan to create a center for
        scholarship in engineering 
        ethics at the NAE as a way of focusing more attention on this critical
         issue.</p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> Didn&#8217;t&#8212;as I already explained.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> None.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> Can&#8217;t say.</p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> No.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> I&#8217;ve looked but haven&#8217;t found anything.</p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> No.</p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> Well, there&#8217;s the obvious: providing guidelines
        for individual  behavior and speaking to the values of the profession.
        In all interesting 
        cases, conscience is not enough of a guide. Teaching ethics will not
        make  an unethical person into an ethical one &#8211; but it helps students
         recognize and deal with real cases when they arise because they will
        have 
        had practice thinking things through.</p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> I&#8217;m unhappy I can&#8217;t recall anything.</p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> No strong reaction one way or the other. However,
        if I may paraphrase  John Ladd, what&#8217;s wrong with codes of ethics
        in general is that  they tend to divert attention from macro-ethics issues
        (such as what standards 
        of safety society should adopt). I think engineering is going to face
         some serious macro ethical issues in the 21st century that differ in
        kind 
        from anything they have faced before.</p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> No idea.</p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> No idea.</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong> No idea.</p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>BW:</strong>No.<br>
