      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background? </strong></p>
      <p>BS in EE (RPI, 1961); MS in EE (NYU, 1963); and a Communications Development 
        Certificate (Bell Labs, 1964).</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p>I now teach and do research at Stevens Institute of Technology, in the 
        Computer Science Department. My title is Industry Research Professor, 
        Software Engineering. But for more than thirty years, until my retirement 
        in 1996, I worked at Bell Labs, eventually becoming Chief Technical Officer 
        of the Operations Systems Business Unit and an Executive Director. In 
        parallel with these Bell Labs positions, I was the Operations Systems 
        Vice President of Network Systems (1992-1996). That&#8217;s what really 
        matters for this interview.</p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong><br>
        <br>
        I have more than 35 years of developing, managing, and teaching software. 
        My job assignments just led in that direction&#8212;as software replace 
        electrical circuits.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, by training (EE degrees) and by practice.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p>I believe Computers and Society 21 (October 1991) alerted me to Don Gotterbarn. 
        I contacted him and he then kept me informed as SEEPP took shape. Later 
        I answered (by email) a call for volunteers in a journal (either the ACM 
        or IEEE computer magazine, or both). I also sent Don some material we 
        had used at Bell Labs (on such subjects as drugs, stealing, hacking, and 
        breaking into someone else&#8217;s files and putting in a bomb message). 
        I think Bell Labs&#8217; concern with computer ethics went back to the 
        early 1970s.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>6. What led you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p>I had been interested in ethics for some time before. I was in industry 
        then (Bell Labs). I considered ethics so important that I discussed cases 
        with staff, for example, the one in Peter G. Neumann, &#8220;What&#8217;s 
        in a Name?&#8221; Communications of the ACM 35 (Jan. 1992). p. 186.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p>Yes. The ACM and IEEE codes&#8212;and AT&amp;T&#8217;s own corporate 
        code &#8220;Our Common Bond&#8221;.</p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong><br>
        <br>
        I&#8217;d send Gotterbarn information and he would do something with it. 
        I was on the Professional Competence task force from November 1994 until 
        I left Bell Labs in 1996. I can&#8217;t remember editing any versions 
        of the code or attending any face-to-face meetings. I lost contact when 
        I left Bell Labs.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p>Email.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p> Email seemed to work well. Since I didn&#8217;t participate in any other 
        way, I have nothing to make comparisons with. I was pleased things were 
        happening, saw comments other made being used, but had no sense of the 
        process.</p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p>Each version of the code (comments) was an important milestone. I liked 
        that the successive versions appeared in lots of media, both ACM and IEEE 
        media. I used some of the material at Bell (see attached transparencies). 
        The AT&amp;T code of ethics (which governed Bell Labs) left out ethics 
        associated with research. So, I was always looking for material relevant 
        to research ethics, for example, &#8220;Ethics Gap&#8221;, Computerworld, 
        October 14, 1991, pp. 83-85. </p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p>I believe all the emails are lost. I do have some articles and other 
        materials I collected at the time: S. Unger, &#8220;Help for those who 
        need it&#8221;, The Institute, Dec. 1995, p. __; Jim Nash, &#8220;Technology 
        Raises Many New Ethics Questions&#8221;, Computerworld, 1991, p. 89; Jim 
        Barron, &#8220;Struck Dumb by the Incredible 1-800-Nothing&#8221;, New 
        York Times, Jan. 16, 1990, p. A25 (about a AT&amp;T failure of service 
        caused by violation of the software-development process). Also see my 
        post-1996 handouts (attached).</p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p>I&#8217;m less ambitious. I boiled down my aspirations. I&#8217;m now 
        of the mind that the only way to enforce the code is by law. (I used to 
        think software engineers would police themselves.) I have come to this 
        as a result of trying to get students and software developers to use the 
        code. Too many don&#8217;t want to think about the risks for others of 
        what they do.</p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p> To the extent we can teach the code of ethics to new students, we can 
        raise the quality of practice. One of these days something will happen 
        that&#8217;s so bad that the code of ethics will be used in a court of 
        law. I&#8217;m surprised it hasn&#8217;t happened already. There was, 
        for example, the London Ambulance case. The low-bidder on a 911-type system 
        produced software that queued emergency calls in a way causing long delays, 
        sometimes hours, before an ambulance arrived.</p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p> No.</p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p> No.</p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> Gotterbarn.</p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>

        Will Traz (editor of ACM's Software Engineering Notes) (will.traz@lmco.com), 
        because____________<br>
        Dick Hamlet, professor of software engineering, U. of Portland (Oregon), 
        because__________________</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p> I didn&#8217;t know enough about the process.</p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said? </strong></p>
      <p><br>
        What is the role of government (including such agencies as the National 
        Institute of Standards and Technology)? Licensing seems impractical.<br>
