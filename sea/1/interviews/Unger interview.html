      <p><strong>QUESTIONNAIRE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS WRITE A CODE OF ETHICS</strong></p>
      <p>1. What is your educational background?</p>
<p>BS in EE (Brooklyn Polytechnic, 1952); MS in EE (MIT, 1953); and ScD in EE
  (MIT, 1957).</p>
<p>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do there?</p>
<p>I am a professor in the Computer Science Department of Columbia University.
  I also am a professor in the Electrical Engineering Department. Until recently,
  I was chair of Computer Engineering. I teach, research, and write.</p>
<p>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? If you are
  a software developer, what led you into that field?<br>
                      <br>
  Before I became a professor, I worked at Bell Labs [1957-61]. As part of a
  re-organization, I was asked to head a group to develop a compiler for the
  first electronic telephone switching system (ESS). I agreed to do that for
  a limited time. I was in charge of the compiler group for two years. Later
  I did theoretical work on software (e.g., a program for a syntax analyzer). </p>
<p>4. Are you an engineer?</p>
<p>Yes. I dislike the term &#8220;computer science&#8221;. Science is about understanding
  nature. Engineering is about making artifacts. Software is an artifact. Computer
  science is about making computers and software. That&#8217;s engineering, as
  far I am concerned.</p>
<p>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software Engineering
  and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</p>
<p>I believe Don Gotterbarn contacted me. That was in the early 1990s(at a conference
  or just afterward).<br>
                      <br>
  6. What led you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</p>
<p>I had been involved in developing a number of codes of engineering ethics:
  IEEE code of 1979; IEEE code of 1987; and the American Association of Engineering
  Societies (AAES) code of 1984. This seemed like another opportunity to help
  engineers do what they should.</p>
<p>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved in SEEPP?
  Explain.</p>
<p>Yes. See 6 above.</p>
<p>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially in the
  process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)<br>
                      <br>
  Email comments. I sent you a copy of my comments by email when we arranged
  this interview (attached).</p>
<p>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate by
  email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, or by informal
  conversation, or the like?</p>
<p>Only email, as far as I can recall.</p>
<p>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better than the others?
  Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as best? Why?</p>
<p>My general experience is that face-to-face is the best. But email is pretty
  good. You can think first and have a good exchange when you&#8217;re ready
  for it. </p>
<p>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant to the process?
  (The more details, the better.)</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant to your participation
  in the process? May we have a copy?</p>
<p> Yes, the ones I&#8217;ve already sent. I will look for others. </p>
<p><br>
  13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result of your participation
    in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of ethics?</p>
<p> A code is a good tool for teaching students what they should do about their
  professional responsibilities. It also can be a good excuse to be ethical.
  It helps in arguing with managers. It can serve as a useful reminder to practicing
  engineers.</p>
<p>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially pleased
  with or unhappy about?</p>
<p> No.</p>
<p>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially pleased
  with or unhappy about?</p>
<p> I think it covers a lot of ground and makes many good points.</p>
<p>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems to you especially
  important? Explain.</p>
<p> I wasn&#8217;t involved enough to say.</p>
<p>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, would you
  have done differently?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fuzzy about events, but I think it would have been useful to have
  discussions of the code among practitioners IN GROUPS as the code went through
  its various versions. Just publishing a draft leads to comments that are not
  well thought out. Discussion is important to help people appreciate what they
  have before them. Sometimes group discussions also produce good ideas. I&#8217;m
  skeptical about polling. A mere vote is worthless as information (however useful
  for making decisions).</p>
<p>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? Anything you
  want to add to what you have already said? </p>
<p>Ethics codes have a hollow sound when there is no support mechanism for people
  who want to do what the codes says. Often the problem is not not knowing what&#8217;s
  right but what to risk. Over the last three decades, legal entities have done
  something to protect whistleblowers and other professionals who try to do as
  they should, but not nearly enough.</p>
<p>ATTACHMENTS (Stephen Unger&#8217;s records of communications to SEEPP)</p>
<p>From unger@age.cs.columbia.edu Sat Oct 11 17:44:54 1997<br>
  Date: Sat, 11 Oct 1997 17:43:25 -0400 (EDT)<br>
  From: Stephen Unger &lt;unger@age.cs.columbia.edu&gt;<br>
  To: gotterba@Access.ETSU-Tn.Edu<br>
  Subject: Comments on Draft Code</p>
<p><br>
  Don,</p>
<p>I have reviewed the draft Software Engineering Code of Ethics that you sent
  me. It is an impressive document, full of interesting, important points, covering
  a wide range of topics in considerable detail. Your committee clearly decided
  to go for completeness as opposed to brevity, the opposite of the choice made
  by the IEEE. (I might mention here that the IEEE Ethics Committee plans to
  attempt to get<br>
  the best of both approaches, by developing, over a period of time, an extended
  set of guidelines for the IEEE code.)</p>
<p>I don't have enough time to give your draft the kind of really careful study
  that it deserves, so I will simply pass on to you a few brief suggestions that
  occurred to me as I went over it. Without debating the merits of the comprehensive
  approach, it seems to me that, with careful editing, this draft could be compressed
  to a measurable degree without sacrificing any substance. You very possibly
  have already seen it, but in case you haven't, I am appending a copy of a Swedish
  code<br>
  that I found very interesting. I refer to it in my first comment.</p>
<p>Again, let me say that I think you and your committee did a really fine job.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Steve<br>
  .....................</p>
<p>1. Altho your item 1.07 is similar, the wording of item 3 of the Swedish code
  is very nice and perhaps might suggest some adjustment in your statement. It
  reads: &quot;only take part in projects with the time and resources assigned
  that make it possible to do a good job.&quot;</p>
<p>2. In item 2.06 you say, &quot;Be fair and truthful in all statements...&quot;.
  Consider using a term such as &quot;avoid deception&quot;, which not only prohibits
  falsehoods, but also covers the case of deceiving via not disclosing relevant
  information, in other words,<br>
  deception by omission.</p>
<p>3. It ought to be possible to merge items 3.03 and 3.04 in a single statement
  that would cover offering, soliciting, and accepting bribes.</p>
<p>4. Item 4.01 reading, &quot;Provide service only in areas of their competence.&quot; may
  be a bit too restrictive. There are circumstances where it may be appropriate
  to accept assignments outside one's area of competence. The important point
  is to disclose fully one's limitations. (See item 6 of the IEEE code.)</p>
<p>5. While it may be implied by the current wording of 5.03, it might be well
  to make more explicit a requirement that the professional development of subordinates
  be given some consideration when giving them work assignments.</p>
<p>6. Item 6.07. &quot;Only accept remuneration appropriate to professional qualifications
  or experience&quot; may be a good rule to advocate, but I don't think it is
  appropriate in an ethics code.</p>
<p>7. Item 6.05 reads: &quot;Report anything reasonably believed to be a violation
  of this code to appropriate authorities.&quot; While I am not prepared to generate
  a big argument about this, it somehow bothers me. A minor point is that, for
  many parts of the code, there might not be any &quot;appropriate authorities&quot; to
  report to. Perhaps more basic is a vague distaste with requiring people to &quot;turn
  in&quot; delinquent<br>
  colleagues. This is NOT to deny that there are many cases where this is appropriate
  and necessary, but I wonder if it should be made into a universal rule. Rule
  2.01 covers an important subset of such cases. This might be expanded by including,
  for example situations where other forms of harm to people, such as theft,
  fraud, or plagiarism is involved.</p>
<p>8. Item 7.03, &quot;Credit fully the work of others.&quot; might be expanded
  by including an item enjoining against taking credit for the work of others.
  Here, I have in mind the common practice of managers or professors adding their
  names as coauthors of papers to which they made no substantial contributions.</p>
<p>9. Item 7.07, &quot;Not interfere in the professional career progression of
  any colleague.&quot; is one that, while very reasonable on its face, and in
  many situations clearly one that we would like to see enforced, can easily
  be perverted to serve unethical purposes. There is a history of such provisions
  in the codes of engineering societies being used to attack conscientious engineers
  pointing out serious wrongdoing by<br>
  other engineers that threatened the public safety or welfare. You might refer
  to my book for examples. (I failed to prevent such a provision from being inserted
  in the IEEE code.)</p>
<p>10. While Principle 7 includes the words, &quot;treat all those with whom
  they work fairly&quot;, which certainly implies that discrimination on the
  basis of irrelevant factors is unethical, I believe that, particularly in a
  comprehensive code, this should be stated explicitly. This is done well, I
  believe in item 8 of the IEEE code.<br>
