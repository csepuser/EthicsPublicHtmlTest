      <p><strong>1. What is your educational 
          background?</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>I received a Diploma in Engineering in Mechanical Engineering in 1972 
        (roughly equivalent to an MS) from the Federal Institute of Technology 
        (ETH for Eidgenoessiche Technische Hochschule). I began work as a structural 
        engineer in 1972, using computers as part of the job. As time went on, 
        writing software became an ever-bigger part of the job, until I came to 
        think of myself as a software engineer. There was not then a career path 
        leading to software engineering.</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p>I work for an educational institution, the same ETH from which I received 
        a Diploma (the Swiss equivalent of MIT and CalTech). I am in charge of 
        Computer Services for the Institute. On a given day, I devote about a 
        third of his time to problems that arose during the night, a third cleaning 
        up problems from before, and a third to the future (writing software, 
        working out the architecture of new systems the Institute might install, 
        reading technical literature, and so on). This is a change from my previous 
        work, which was support for supercomputing users. My work has always been 
        in research (in industry and in academia). </p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong></p>
      <p>Not 100% software developer. Developing software has always been a part 
        of what I do, but only a part.&#8221; He has, however, developed a lot 
        of software during his 30 years of engineering, beginning with his work 
        in structural engineering. &#8221;I&#8217;ve never been able to hire assistants 
        to write code, input data, or do other subsidiary jobs, just colleagues 
        who worked more or less parallel to me. So, I&#8217;ve always had to work 
        on developing software as part of projects in which I was involved. </p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes. I think that engineering is defined by a certain base of knowledge 
        that is used to create a product. I am not sure there are any particular 
        procedures that define engineering. Throughout my career, I have used 
        that knowledge to create products. I still am doing that. So, I am an 
        engineer.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p>I&#8217;ve been trying to remember, but I can&#8217;t. I must, I think, 
        have read about it in one the ACM or IEEE magazines I get.</p>
      <p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p>I read an invitation to comment on Version 3, which was posted on a home 
        page. I took a look, got some ideas, printed out the document, worked 
        out the ideas, and sent in the resulting comments. For example, I thought 
        that the Principles should be considered exhaustive, even though the Rules 
        under the Principles should not. Version 3 declared neither Principles 
        nor Rules to be exhaustive. I thought that a mistake. I also thought that 
        they should order the Principles according to importance. The order they 
        had didn&#8217;t make sense to me. I couldn&#8217;t tell what the order 
        meant.</p>
      <p>Apparently, my comments didn&#8217;t arrive in time. I got an email from 
        Gotterbarn telling me they already had a Version 4, but that some of my 
        ideas corresponded to changes they had made in Version 3. That&#8217;s 
        in email 8 Jan 1998 that I am giving you. (All the emails can also be 
        found on the page:</p>
      <p>http://www.id.ethz.ch/Homepage/sigut/ethics.mail</p>
      <p>I don&#8217;t know how it happened that I was too late. I also made some 
        comments on Version 4. I do not have a record of my exact input because 
        I submitted it through the web page available for that purpose, but a 
        copy of the comments is included on the &#8220;comment&#8221; web page 
        discussed further below. I commented on the form in which the comments 
        on Version 4 were reported. The layout of the web page made figuring out 
        what went with what very hard. The web page was not a good example of 
        how a result of software engineering should look. I&#8217;m giving you 
        a copy of my homepage where I&#8217;ve saved the objectionable web page:</p>
      <p> http://www.id.ethz.ch/Homepage/sigut/ethics.comment_orig.html</p>
      <p>A partially clean-up version (response 11) of the same page is available 
        at:</p>
      <p>http:// www.id.ethz.ch/Homepage/sigut/ethics.comment.html</p>
      <p>I&#8217;m also giving you my comments on Version 3 (see appendix).</p>
      <p>That was the extent of my participation. After that I was a spectator.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain</strong>.</p>
      <p>Oh, yes. I was familiar with the ACM code, the IEEE code, and the Swiss 
        Engineering Code of Ethics.</p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p>See 6 above.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p>I participated in just two ways. First, by email, as I explained earlier 
        [6]. I also wrote comments to Version 4 on the home page provided.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p>I preferred the email. It gave more control over formatting and left 
        me with a copy of whatever I did. The home page did not provide a copy. 
        But I have no recommendation. I&#8217;m not sure what led SEEPP to use 
        one medium rather than another.</p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p>No, nothing&#8212;except the layout of the web page (as I already explained).</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes. In addition to the web pages, as I already explained, I am providing 
        a copy of Version 3 as I received it, with my handwritten comments (dated 
        08 Jan. 1998), about 20 pages, and Version 4, with a few handwritten comments, 
        about 10 pages.</p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p>No change in ideas. Of course, details are always open to discussion.</p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p>I think it&#8217;s important that people realize that there is something 
        like that [a code of ethics] at all; important that they think about what 
        they&#8217;re doing, that there is an environment that the software will 
        have to work in, that there are standards any competent writer of software 
        should apply. Too many people in engineering professions see just the 
        immediate technical problem and do not stop to consider that there are 
        other considerations as well.</p>
      <p>Another point of having a code of ethics is that people who do use ethical 
        considerations in their life get a reassurance and a moral support in 
        their daily business. It is easier to make an unpopular decision, if you 
        can lean on an independent authority.</p>
      <p>Also the code could be used during the education process to emphasize 
        that &#8216;we&#8212;the (software) engineers&#8212;do or don&#8217;t 
        do certain things&#8217;. In a profession that has such a big leverage, 
        certain morality should be &#8216;built-in&#8217;.</p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about</strong>?</p>
      <p>I&#8217;m sorry I got in so late. I&#8217;m also unhappy that I didn&#8217;t 
        get a reply to my suggestions about the home page and my last comments. 
        On the other hand, I was happy that I was able to participate at all&#8212;and 
        that they did accept some of my suggestions.</p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p>The following comments are based on version 5.2 of the Code:</p>
      <p>Full version; PREAMBLE; 1st paragraph; 2nd sentence: The text &quot;are 
        those who&quot; could be left out. As it is, the sentence can be interpreted 
        as a definition of a &quot;software engineer&quot; instead of (as I understand 
        it) an enumeration of the software engineers&#8217; contributions. </p>
      <p>Full Version; PREAMBLE; 3rd paragraph; 2nd sentence: It still says &quot;The 
        list of Principles [...] is not exhaustive&quot;. Apart from my critique, 
        I understood during the interview that this is NOT the intended meaning.</p>
      <p>Looking at the Clauses 1.04, 6.06 and 6.13 I ask: &quot;who will protect 
        the Software Engineer who reports or disobeys the law&quot;? If the backing 
        is not guaranteed, acting according to these clauses (or the given exception) 
        might lead to unpleasant results.</p>
      <p>Clause 1.02: I would have chosen &quot;temper&quot; instead of &quot;moderate&quot;.</p>
      <p>Clause 2.01: I would suggest using &quot;frank&quot; or &quot;candid&quot; 
        instead of &quot;forthright&quot;.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems to 
        you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p>No idea. Remember I was all by myself in Switzerland. My only contact 
        was by email and web.</p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p>No idea.</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p>Not really qualified to say as far as the process itself is concerned. 
        I can&#8217;t understand why I didn&#8217;t notice an announcement of 
        the project earlier. I was regularly reading the journals where it appeared. 
        Perhaps publicity might have been better. Bigger ads, maybe.</p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said? </strong></p>
      <p> No, not now. Except that it was good to have a face-to-face interview. 
        I hate filling out questionnaires. I always wonder whether I understand 
        the questions right. Am I helping the researchers&#8212;or just wasting 
        my time?</p>
