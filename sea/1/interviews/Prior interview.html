      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> I have a BA in English from the University of Lancaster (1975) and an
  MSc [Master of Science) in Computer Science from the University of Aston (1988).
  After my BA, I worked for a long time as a librarian, getting more and more
  involved in the information systems. Eventually, I decided I should know more
  about computer science; so, I took the MSc. When I got that degree, I became
  a university lecturer here.</p>
<p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do there?</strong></p>
<p> <strong>MP:</strong> I teach Systems Analysis and Design, Data Modelling
  and Database Design, and Comparative Systems Development Methodologies, in
  the School of Computing
  here at De Montfort University.</p>
<p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? If you are
  a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> My masters work involved developing some software. Soon
  after my masters, I worked on two contracts for a company here in Leicester
  that also involved
  developing some software. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve done much since then.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>4. Are you an engineer? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> No. I work on business applications of software. My concern
  is the use of computers in business organizations. Engineers build software.
  I analyze the
  needs of business to determine what kinds of software they need. I might write
  specifications for software, but I would not build the software.</p>
<p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task Force on Software Engineering
  and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP:</strong> I heard about SEEPP through Don Gotterbarn, when he was
  here (Jan or Feb1997), and through Simon Rogerson who at the time was in the
  same Department as me).
  I&#8217;m not sure which of them was the first to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s wor</strong>k? </p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>In March 1995, we had our first ETHICOMP [Ethics-Computers] meeting at De
  Montfort. I presented a paper saying that we should have a Hippocratic oath
  like physicians. So, I was already thinking about codes of ethics in computing.
  SEEPP&#8217;s work connected with my interest. The invitation was all I needed.</p>
<p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved in SEEPP?
  Explain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>The BCS [British Computer Society] has a code of ethics and I had looked at
  it. I had also looked at other codes in this profession, the one for IMIS (Institute
  for the Management of Information Systems) in the UK, and the ACM&#8217;s and
  the IEEE&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially
    in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>When Don sent out a draft by email, I would respond by email (starting late
  in 1995 or early in 1996). Yes, even though my office was separated from his
  (and Simon&#8217;s) only by a few floors, I think my involvement was largely,
  if not entirely, by email. I was busy at that time. As time went on, I may
  have responded less. I left DMU in September 1997. From then on, I think I
  lost touch and did not participate at all.</p>
<p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate by
  email, or by phone, or by face-to-face meetings, or by letter, or by information
  conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>Email, as I said. I&#8217;m sure I had no significant conversation with anyone
  about the code while it was being drafted.</p>
<p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better than the others?
  Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as best? Why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>Email got me the text; it enabled me to respond quickly; and it allowed me
  to respond briefly, even with a one-liner. I think it worked pretty well. If
  I had had to write a memo, I might have done nothing. With a memo, you have
  to say enough to fill at least a good part of the page. Sometimes I didn&#8217;t
  have that much to say.</p>
<p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant to the process?
  (The more details, the better?) </strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>Don was here. I was aware of the reiterations of drafts trying to absorb comments.
  I don&#8217;t envy trying to get a draft everyone can sign off on. I didn&#8217;t
  pay attention to the politics&#8212;though I could tell there was a lot of
  politics, making the draft so everyone could sign off on it.</p>
<p><strong>12. Do you have documents, paper or electronic, relevant to your participation
  in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>No, sadly. When I left DMU, my computer&#8217;s hard drive was erased&#8212;and
  I didn&#8217;t keep paper copies.</p>
<p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result of
    your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>My thinking about the value of codes has not changed. But I now have a greater
  appreciation of the difficulty of drafting such a document.</p>
<p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of ethics?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>We should be adding to the sum of human benefit. It&#8217;s important that
  professionals have to put down their marker: Here is what we stand for. Putting
  down your marker helps with educating the next generation. It is also helpful
  to individuals who run into an ethical issue, giving them a framework for support.
  Codes also get a profession talking. It raises issues.</p>
<p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially pleased
  with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>I wish I could have been more involved than I was. </p>
<p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially pleased
  with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>I&#8217;m not unhappy about anything. I&#8217;m happy it got through the process
  and was adopted.</p>
<p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems to you especially
  important? Explain.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>Don [Gotterbarn]. Simon [Rogerson] to give you the UK
  perspective. And Ben [Fairweather] because he&#8217;s a philosopher.</p>
<p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain. </strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>Maybe someone not involved in the process, Steve McRobb, is working on the
  IMIS code. He might be interesting to talk to for a comparison.</p>
<p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything would you
  have done differently?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>Can&#8217;t answer. I was just not aware enough of the process to know what
  to change.</p>
<p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? Anything
    you want to add to what you have already said? </strong></p>
<p><strong>MP: </strong>No.</p>
