      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background? </strong> 
      <p>B.S. (1973) in Mathematics (with minor in Computer Science/Physics), 
        from Southern Utah State College. M.S in Computer Science (1983) from 
        the University of Utah (Software Emphasis). Ph.D. in Computer Science 
        from Brigham Young University (1998). My dissertation was Verification 
        of a Secure Web Server.</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p>I work for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). 
        It used to be called the Bureau of Standards. It&#8217;s part of the federal 
        government. There are about 3000 employees, mostly well educated. Part 
        of what NIST does is develop voluntary standards for chemistry, time, 
        length, and so on. For example, an industry may want to standardize a 
        certain screw or software interface. We develop the standards. This is 
        an ethical, objective, and honest organization. I&#8217;ve been here five 
        years. I work in computer and math services. My title is Computer Scientist. 
        I help develop standards for testing software. I am also interested in 
        formal methods, including proofs of program correctness.</p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong></p>
      <p>Lots. My first real job was at a small insurance company (about 20 people) 
        in Salt Lake City (1977-82). I designed systems for accounting, payroll, 
        tracking insurance policies, and so on and then oversaw their implementation. 
        I spent another seven years at a company that designed integrated circuits 
        (1984-91). I built design tools, that is, software to aid in designing 
        circuits. I worked in software quality control and configuration management 
        at other companies until 1993 when I moved to Utah to finish my degree. 
      </p>
      <p>I loved the idea of programming computers since I was 12. Software development 
        was just working at that.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p>Not by title. I like to think of myself as doing engineering stuff, but 
        engineers have lots of training that I don&#8217;t have. So, maybe I&#8217;m 
        an &#8220;amateur engineer&#8221; or someone aspiring to be an engineer. 
        I design and construct programs. Designing and constructing is what engineers 
        do too. I also look beyond the specifications I&#8217;m given to the larger 
        issues: delivery, administering the life cycle, and so, just as engineers 
        do.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p>If I recall right, I saw a blurb in the Communications of the ACM late 
        in 1997 about V. 3 of the code. </p>
      <p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p>I felt a duty to get involved. They were, after all, setting standards. 
        That was something I though I could help with. The standards might help 
        to shape the making of software. Those standards could be important.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p>I&#8217;d read the ACM code, of course; and the Hippocratic oath. I had 
        also read about civil engineers. [MD: At this point, PB pulled from his 
        shelf what seemed to be a textbook on civil engineering practice published 
        in 1891.He pointed out the mature and detailed standards the book laid 
        out.] We need to develop ways to write software that works. Either we 
        should be able to prove that a particular piece of software is reliable 
        or keep the software simple enough so that its reliability is obvious. 
        Of course, a third possibility is for society to accept buggy software 
        and the losses that come from it. But I don&#8217;t think we should just 
        accept bugs, especially if the software has an important social use. Maybe 
        bugs are okay in games but that&#8217;s about the only place.</p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p>I sent in comments on V. 3 after seeing that blurb. I also commented 
        on V. 4 after receiving an invitation to do so from Donald Gotterbarn. 
        Most of my comments were on presentation, for example, why use the word 
        &#8220;third party&#8221; in a few places when the text would be clearer 
        if it used one or more of the terms already standard throughout the code 
        (&#8220;public&#8221;, &#8220;user&#8221;, etc.)? Only a few of my comments 
        were substantive. In a few places, I thought they had gone beyond what 
        was appropriate for a professional code, for example, by calling upon 
        software engineers to volunteer for civic work. I liked the code overall, 
        especially, it saying that it was intended as &#8220;guidelines&#8221; 
        to help you think through the problems you&#8217;ll face.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p>For V. 3, I participated by email. For V. 4, I think I used a web site 
        set up for that purpose. I also initially learned of the process from 
        a paper communication. I never raised the subject with my colleagues. 
        So, I didn&#8217;t participate by face-to-face meetings. I&#8217;m not 
        sure why I never raised the subject with my colleagues. Perhaps it was 
        because I was new here [at NIST] and didn&#8217;t know anyone who I thought 
        would be interested. Maybe I would have if the blurb, email, or web site 
        had said &#8220;discuss this with your colleagues&#8221;.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p>Email seemed very effective to me. I liked the web site too. It had lots 
        of resources presented in an order much easier to use than if everything 
        had been on paper.</p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p>Most of my &#8220;work&#8221; was just taking the time to sit down, read 
        through the code, and think about it. Other than reading the two versions 
        of the code, I didn&#8217;t take part in any of the discussions. An advantage 
        of just reading the code is that I could represent those reading the code 
        in the future: what was confusing, ambiguous, or hard to understand? If 
        I had been involved in the discussions, I may have thought I knew what 
        the passages meant, not realizing understanding came from experience in 
        the discussion.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes. I will forward them by email attachment. [MD: I now have them.]</p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes. I was enlightened (and glad to see) that a code of ethics could 
        be written as guidelines saying&#8212;explicitly&#8212;here are things 
        to think about, but rules can&#8217;t cover everything. You&#8217;re going 
        to have to think whether the code may have left something out. Good Preface!</p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p>There are at least two. First, the code is there so that if someone is 
        unethical, we can point to the code and say, &#8220;See, you&#8217;re 
        being unethical.&#8221; The code provides a common standard. This is important, 
        but not nearly as important as the second: the code is a personal guide 
        in choosing one&#8217;s own behavior. It reminds us of what we might otherwise 
        forget. It inspires us to do more than we might otherwise do. It is an 
        aid to personal improvement. I&#8217;d like to live an ethical life. I 
        appreciate a bunch of people getting together to offer me advise on how 
        I might be more ethical in my work.</p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p>No. Just happy to have participated.</p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p>I am very pleased that this code exists. I am also pleased with the Preface 
        because of how it explains the code (the code as guide lines to help in 
        thinking issues through). What I&#8217;m unhappy about&#8212;and this 
        is only a minor unhappiness&#8212;are phrases here and there that sound 
        like jumping on the latest bandwagon, for example, provisions that use 
        &#8220;code words&#8221; like &#8220;diversity&#8221; or &#8220;environment&#8221;. 
        I think I agree with the underlying sentiment in these provisions but 
        when one of those code words is there, I can&#8217;t be sure how it might 
        be interpreted in the future.</p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p>Gotterbarn (esp. for V. 3). Leonard Tripp for V. 4. Tripp seemed to be 
        in charge at this stage. I was always able to reach him at twood@computer.org. 
        These were the only people I corresponded with.</p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p>Practically speaking, probably nothing. Ideally, though, I think I would 
        have made sure than every invitation to participate included a statement 
        urging people to talk to the people around them about the code&#8212;before 
        sending in comments. That might have enlarged input considerably.</p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said?</strong></p>
      <p>You didn&#8217;t ask about my background as a person. It might help you 
        to understand my other answers. I&#8217;m a religious person, a member 
        of the Church of Christ of the Latter Day Saints. I attend church regularly. 
        The Church encourages us to join civic organizations to help society be 
        better, even if joining is not convenient or comfortable. That may explain 
        why I said I felt a duty to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work. It may 
        also explain another way I am unhappy with the code, though I understand 
        that nothing much could have been done about it. It saddened me that there 
        was no place in the code for God. The U.S. Constitution has a place for 
        God; so, why not the code? Of course, that question raises very large 
        issues about how a code should be used in a society.</p>
