                   <p align="justify">We need your response. On February 13th the 
 
                     SEEPP task force forwarded to you a revised code of ethics, 
 
                     a schedule for completing the project in a timely fashion 
 
                     and several supporting documents requested by Steering committee 
 
                     members. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In order for the SEEPP Task Force to continue 
 
                     to move forward we need from you, 1) your comments on the 
 
                     code, 2) approval for the establishment of a web site. 3) 
 
                     approval to distribute the code for comment using society 
 
                     journals,</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">We have not received any comments on the 
 
                     code, so we can presume that we are getting closer to the 
 
                     mark with the code and that the explanations of the changes 
 
                     were satisfactory.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The proposal to use the Centre for Computing 
 
                     and Social Responsibility as the central web site was rejected 
 
                     and we were told to use the IEEE and ACM web sites. I have 
 
                     received no response to my request for the names of contacts 
 
                     at those web sites who have been advised to co- operate with 
 
                     this effort. Has the ACM and IEEE agreed to allow us to use 
 
                     their sites and if so are the contacts.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">I have also requested Steering Committee 
 
                     permission to distribute the draft code for preliminary comment 
 
                     in two ACM newsletters. I requested permission to distribute 
 
                     the code in these newsletters in time for the publication 
 
                     to occur in the Summer of 1997. These newsletter have publication 
 
                     deadlines. The deadline for the SIGCAS Newsletter has already 
 
                     passed, but the editor is willing to accept the document if 
 
                     I can get it in by the end of this week. If we miss these 
 
                     deadlines, then the earliest he draft could appear would be 
 
                     September.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The project is at a stand still. The time 
 
                     specifically dedicated to this project is being used waiting 
 
                     for approval to move forward. Small delays at this stage will 
 
                     cause the project to drag out. I know you are all quite busy, 
 
                     but we are simply asking permission to continue the iterative 
 
                     development process. We would like to distribute the preliminary 
 
                     code for broader review by those who will be guided by it.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The document we are interested in circulating 
 
                     is attached below for your review. Thank you for your timely

                   <p align="justify">This draft code of ethics was developed by 
 
                     a task force of the Joint IEEE Computer Society and Association 
 
                     for Computing Machinery Steering Committee for the Establishment 
 
                     of Software Engineering as a Profession. The task force on 
 
                     Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices developed 
 
                     this code for a sub-specialization within the constituencies 
 
                     of both of the Computing societies. In an attempt to reflect 
 
                     the international character of both organizations and the 
 
                     profession itself, the composition of the task force is multinational 
 
                     in citizenship and is multi-national in memberships in professional 
 
                     computing organizations. The proposed draft Code of Ethics 
 
                     for Software Engineers (2a) was developed by the task force 
 
                     and reviewed by the Steering Commitee.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Based on the feedback from readers of this 
 
                     publication and from other sources, a final draft of the code 
 
                     will be developed and presented to the Steering Committee 
 
                     for aproval. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS v 2.0a 
 
                     April 1997</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">PREAMBLE v 2.0 </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Computers now have a central and growing 
 
                     role in commerce, industry, government, medicine, education, 
 
                     entertainment, social affairs, and ordinary life. Those who 
 
                     contribute, by direct participation or by teaching, to the 
 
                     design and development of software systems have significant 
 
                     opportunities both to do good and to cause harm AND TO INFLUENCE 
 
                     AND ENABLE OTHERS TO DO GOOD OR CAUSE HARM. To assure, as 
 
                     much as possible, that this power will be used for good, software 
 
                     engineers must commit themselves to making the design and 
 
                     development of software a beneficial, and respected profession. 
 
                     In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall 
 
                     adhere to the following code of ethics. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The code contains eight keyword principles 
 
                     related to the behavior of and decisions made by professional 
 
                     software engineers, be they practitioners, educators, managers 
 
                     and supervisors, or policy makers, as well as trainees and 
 
                     students of the profession. The Principles identify the various 
 
                     relationships in which individuals, groups, and organizations 
 
                     participate and the primary obligations within these relationships. 
 
                     . Each principle of this code addresses three levels of ethical 
 
                     obligation owed by professional software engineers in each 
 
                     of these relationships. The first level identified is a set 
 
                     of ethical values which they share with all other human beings 
 
                     by virtue of their humanity. The second level obliges professionals 
 
                     to a higher order of care for those WHO MAY BE Affected by 
 
                     their work. The third and deeper level comprises several of 
 
                     those obligations which derive directly from elements unique 
 
                     to the professional practice of software engineering. The 
 
                     clauses of each principle are illustrations of the various 
 
                     levels of obligation included in that relationship.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The clauses under each Principle consist 
 
                     of three different types of statement corresponding to each 
 
                     level. Level One: Aspire (to be human); Statements of aspiration 
 
                     provide vision and objectives, are intended to direct professional 
 
                     behavior. These directives require significant ethical judgement. 
 
                     Level Two: Expect (to be professional); Statements of expectation 
 
                     express the obligations of all professionals and professional 
 
                     attitudes. Again they do not describe the specific behavior 
 
                     details but they clearly indicate professional responsibilities 
 
                     in computing. Level Three: Demand (to use good practices); 
 
                     Statements of demand assert more specific behavioral responsibilities 
 
                     within software engineering which are more closely related 
 
                     to the current state of the art. The range of statements is 
 
                     from the more general aspirational statement to specific measurable 
 
                     requirements.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Although all levels of professional obligation 
 
                     are recognized and because the Code contains different types 
 
                     of statements, the Code is not intended to be all inclusive 
 
                     nor is it intended that its individual parts be used in isolation 
 
                     to justify errors of omissions or commission. The list of 
 
                     Principles and Clauses is not exhaustive, and should not be 
 
                     read as separating the acceptable from the unacceptable in 
 
                     professional conduct in all practical situations. The Code 
 
                     is not a simple ethical algorithm which generates ethical 
 
                     decisions. In some situations standards may conflict with 
 
                     each other or with standards from other sources. These situations 
 
                     require the software engineer to use ethical judgement to 
 
                     act in a manner which is most consistent with the SPIRIT OF 
 
                     THE code of ethics, given the circumstances. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">These ethical tensions can best be answered 
 
                     by thoughtful consideration of fundamental principles, rather 
 
                     than reliance on detailed regulations. These Principles should 
 
                     influence you to consider broadly who is affected by your 
 
                     work; to examine if (we) YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES are treating 
 
                     other human beings with due respect; to speculate on how the 
 
                     public would view your decision IF THEY WERE REASONABLY WELL 
 
                     INFORMED; to analyze how the least empowered will be affected 
 
                     by your decision; and to consider if your acts would be considered 
 
                     worthy of the ideal PROFESSIONAL WORKING AS A software engineer. 
 
                     Since this code represents a consensus of those engaged in 
 
                     the profession one should TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT IS (determine 
 
                     to act in a manner) likely to be judged as the most ethical 
 
                     way to act in the circumstances by informed, respected, and 
 
                     experienced peers in possession of all the facts AND ONLY

                   <p align="justify">The dynamic and demanding context of software 
 
                     engineering requires a code that is adaptable and relevant 
 
                     to new situations as they occur. But even in this generality, 
 
                     the code provides support for the software engineer who needs 
 
                     to take positive action by documenting the ethical stance 
 
                     of the profession; an ethical foundation to which individuals 
 
                     within teams and the team as a whole can appeal. The code 
 
                     also helps to define those things which are ethically improper 
 
                     to request of an software engineer. The code has an educational 
 
                     function, by stating what is required of anyone wishing to 
 
                     join or continue in the software engineering community. Because 
 
                     it expresses the consensus of the profession on ethical issues 
 
                     it can be used as a guide to decision making and as means
