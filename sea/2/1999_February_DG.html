       <p>Is IEEE-USA facing an ethical dilemma? </p>
       <p><br>
         BY DON GOTTERBARN ACM Ethics Committee Chairman</p>
       <p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE-Computer Society 
         have adopted the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional 
         Practice (5.2). This is significant, given that the state of Texas has 
         already licensed software engineers without defining any standard of ethical 
         practice. This oversight is dangerous for two reasons. First, licensed 
         software engineers will obey the law, but laws provide inadequate guidance 
         in many critical situations. And second, the failure to connect specific 
         ethical standards to licensing encourages the mistaken view that there 
         is little agreement among software engineers about their professional 
         and moral obligations. The code's development, however, indicates a significant 
         agreement among software engineers about the way they ought to behave.</p>
       <p> The code also provides mechanisms to help practitioners make ethical 
         judgments in those situations where the law is silent.</p>
       <p> The code was developed by the joint IEEE-CS/ACM task force on Software 
         Engineering Ethics and Professional Practice (SEEPP). The SEEPP task force 
         is multinational in citizenship and in membership in professional computing 
         organizations. After extensive study of several codes of ethics of computing 
         societies, engineering societies and other professions, SEEPP selected 
         imperatives for the draft code. SEEPP also contributed new imperatives 
         related to its knowledge of software engineering and based on external 
         reviewers' suggestions.</p>
       <p> The draft code was reviewed by members of several professional computing 
         societies and went through several revisions. Version 3 appeared with 
         a turnaround ballot in the IEEE-CS's and the ACM's flagship magazines. 
         Most clauses received better than a 90 percent approval rating. Contributed 
         comments led to the development of Version 4 which SEEPP submitted for 
         peer review using the IEEE's formal technical standard review process. 
         Again, the code easily passed this process. Comments were used to develop 
         the final version of the code (www-cs. etsu.edu/seeri/secode.htm) which 
         was approved by the ACM in November and the IEEE-CS in December.</p>
       <p> I found the consistently high level of agreement about the behavior 
         expected of a professional software engineer very significant. There is 
         general agreement about our obligations as software engineers, even if 
         some software engineers give in to external pressures not to follow these 
         obligations.</p>
       <p> The code aids decision making by overcoming two difficulties with other 
         codes. First, most codes of ethics provide a finite list of principles 
         which are often presented as a complete list and the reader presumes that 
         only things on the list should be of ethical concern for the professional. 
         Second, many codes provide no guidance for situations where rules, having 
         equal priority, appear to conflict. This equal priority leaves the ethical 
         decision maker confused. The software engineering code addresses both 
         of these limitations.</p>
       <p> The code explicitly rejects the concept of completeness. &quot;It is 
         not intended that the individual parts of the Code be used in isolation 
         to justify errors of omission or commission. The list of Principles and 
         Clauses is not exhaustive. The Clauses should not be read as separating 
         the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical 
         situations. The Code is not a simple ethical algorithm which generates 
         ethical decisions.&quot; </p>
       <p>The code addresses completeness by providing general guidance for ethical 
         decision making, especially in those areas not explicitly mentioned in 
         the code. &quot;Ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful consideration 
         of fundamental principles, rather than blind reliance on detailed regulations. 
         These Principles should influence software engineers to consider broadly 
         who is affected by their work; to examine if they and their colleagues 
         are treating other human beings with due respect; to consider how the 
         public, if reasonably well informed, would view their decisions; to analyze 
         how the least empowered will be affected by their decisions; and to consider 
         whether their acts would be judged worthy of the ideal professional working 
         as a software engineer. In all these judgments, concern for the health, 
         safety and welfare of the public is primary; that is, the &quot;Public 
         Interest&quot; is central to this Code.&quot;</p>
       <p> The first principle asks the developer to consider all stakeholders, 
         not just the software engineer's employer or client. The second principle--due 
         respect--requires a protection of human values. This section states that 
         in all decisions the public interest is the primary concern. To reinforce 
         the priority of public well-being, the code asserts the priority of concern 
         for the public over loyalty to the employer or profession. It is a professional's 
         obligation to take positive action to address violations of the code. 
         The code addresses both the responsibilities of the practicing professional 
         and of the profession. Several large software companies have posted the 
         code as an expected standard for their employees. Its adoption by two 
         large computing organizations is a positive step because this code is 
         not designed to be self-serving to the profession. The code requires software 
         engineering professionals to be ethically responsible to all of those 
         who are affected by their products. </p>
