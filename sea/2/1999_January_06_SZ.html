       <p>Dennis Frailey writing to selected members of the SWEBOK project, IAB,
         SWECC, and various related efforts.</p>
       <p>This is a white paper outlining my thoughts on an issue that is of considerable
         importance to the software engineering projects being sponsored by SWECC:
         Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), education, ethics and professional practices,
         and (to be established) performance norms. I also propose some possible
         solutions. I invite comment and critique from all affected parties. I
         intend to propose implementing something along these lines at the SWECC
         meeting in Austin on January 28?29, so timely response is of the essence.</p>
       <p>The issue:</p>
       <p>It has become clear in recent communcation that there is somewhat of
         a disconnect over defining certain parts of the body of knowledge for
         software engineering. Specifically, although the BOK project has clear
         plans for identifying and documenting those knowledge areas that are
         unique to software engineering, it is not clear how we will identify
         what knowledge areas within computer science and other disciplines are
         part of what a software engineer must know. These form the foundation
         upon which a software engineer must be educated, just as a solid &quot;pre
         med&quot; program is the foundation on which medical doctors are educated.
         While those who define the body of knowledge for a medical doctor do
         not define chemistry, they certainly identify what parts of chemistry
         a medical doctor must know.</p>
       <p>Upon reflection, it seems to me that this problem is a direct result
         of the relative autonomy of the various projects. I would like to see
         that change and, since SWECC's role is to coordinate, I am proposing
         a way that we could coordinate a closer form of work among the projects.</p>
       <p>The goal:</p>
       <p>It is clear that we must eventually define all that a software engineer
         should know in order to properly define curricula, establish accreditation
         criteria, and prepare licensing examinations. It is also clear that all
         of our projects have both interest and expertise to contribute to this.
         Therefore I would like to offer some ideas that might lead to a strategy
         for accomplishing what we all hope will be accomplished.</p>
       <p>The approach:</p>
       <p>My suggestions involve two elements: an agreement regarding division
         of responsibility and an agreement for cooperative activity among the
         various projects. Speaking from the SWECC perspective, I propose that
         SWECC coordinate and facilitate these cooperative activities once the
         projects agree on what they would be.</p>
       <p>As an example of a cooperative activity, the education project has recently
         discussed a possible workshop that would deal with certain issues about
         what must be in the core curriculum of a software engineer. I believe
         this is an excellent example of an activity that could be cooperative
         among the projects, because it would address key issues that affect all
         of them.</p>
       <p>Division of Responsibility</p>
       <p>I propose that the BOK project accept full responsibility for the following:</p>
       <p>- identifying the knowledge areas that are unique to software engineers
         and identifying, within each knowledge area, identifying and providing
         reference material to definitive sources on the topics that are essential
         to a software engineer. They have already produced a baseline set of
         such knowledge areas and I believe this part of their activity is well
         underway </p>
       <p>- identifying other disciplines that contain knowledge areas that are
         important for a software engineer. This too has already been done in
         a baseline manner.</p>
       <p>I propose that the BOK project and the Education project accept joint
         responsibility (and include tasks in both of their plans) for: </p>
       <p>-identifying those knowledge areas within other disciplines (computer
         science, computer engineering, math, science, etc) that are necessary
         for a software engineers. Examples might include</p>
       <p> <br>
   data structures from computer science or computer architecture from computer
     engineering or discrete mathematics</p>
       <p>I propose that the Education project accept full responsibility for
         identifying and providing authoritative references for the topics within
         each knowledge area from &quot;other&quot; disciplines that are necessary
         for software engineers. I believe this has already been started, and
         as a SWECC member I would endorse further work in this area</p>
       <p>I propose that the (not yet formed) performance norms project work jointly
         with the Code of Ethics and Professional Practices project to identify
         the tasks that a software engineer would be expected to perform. Perhaps
         the other two projects should also be involved in this. This would be
         based on the knowledge areas defined by the other two projects and would
         probably not commence for about a year. At that time, the two projects
         should further define how this can be subdivided, but it seems to me
         that the Code of Ethics and Professional Practices project would concentrate
         on defining the professional practices that would be considered essential
         for a software engineer and the performance norms project would focus
         on the skills and the performance standards associated with these.</p>
       <p>Cooperative activity:</p>
       <p>Each project would have an (at least) annual review of its progress,
         to which each other project and SWECC should be invited to send representatives.
         This review might occur during a SWECC meeting or might occur separately,
         depending on the magnitude of the project and the amount of work to be
         reported on. SWECC can attempt to schedule its meetings to adjoin major
         project reviews so as to minimize travel for all concerned. Since SWECC
         must report to its sponsoring societies (ACM and IEEE-CS) on an annual
         basis, we can also coordinate the timing to fit their annual schedules.</p>
       <p>For all responsibilities that are joint, the affected projects should
         plan and budget for appropriate joint activities and should keep SWECC
         and the other projects informed of these.</p>
       <p>I invite comments and suggestions.</p>
