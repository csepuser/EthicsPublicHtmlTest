       <p>Norm,
       <p>I did not know if you had a particular style in mind. I did not change
         the recommendations (&quot;we recommend...&quot;) and my suggestion would
         be to put the four recommendations in a side bar next to the rest of
         the text (background, approach, and the closing footnote/paragraph).<br>
   Mario</p>
       <p>Background<br>
   On May 21, 1993, the IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors established a
     steering committee for evaluating, planning, and coordinating actions related
     to establishing software engineering as a profession. Pursuant to the motion
     of the BoG, President Aylor appointed Mario Barbacci as the chairman of the
     steering committee. Other members of the committee include James Aylor (ex?officio),
     Fletcher Buckley, Larry Druffel, Win Royce, Norm Schneidewind, and Stu Zweben. </p>
       <p>The committee is currently defining a process and agenda for the working
         committees and task forces, to be appointed later. The initial recommendations
         were presented at the next meeting of the Board of Governors, on November
         12, 1993.<br>
   Recommendation 1: Adopt Standard Definitions</p>
       <p>We recommend the adoption of a standard set of definitions. IEEE Standard
         610.12 is a good starting place. Other standard glossaries might be appropriate
         but in any event, these definitions should be carefully examined for
         appropriateness and scope. This task could be entrusted to the Standards
         Activities Board of the Computer Society and the appropriate Standards
         Subcommittee(s).</p>
       <p>Recommendation 2: Define Required Body of Knowledge and Recommended
         Practices</p>
       <p>We recommend the identification of a required body of knowledge and
         recommended practices (in electrical engineering, for example, electromagnetic
         theory is part of the body of knowledge while the National Electrical
         Safety Code is a recommended practice.) The required body of knowledge
         and recommended practices are not static because technology evolves and
         the professionals should keep up with the field. This activity should
         be entrusted to a task force of industry experts. Industry should lead
         the effort because employers know what their software engineers do well,
         poorly, or indifferently.</p>
       <p>Adoption of new practices often requires cultural changes and these
         processes take years to accomplish. Thus, the initial set of recommended
         practices ought to be modest and easily achievable. The development and
         maintenance of the set of recommended practices should be structured
         like a technical standard: adopted by consensus and subject to periodic
         revision.</p>
       <p>We should not confuse organizational practices with individual practices.
         Organizational maturity is already the subject of a healthy activity
         by Software Engineering Process Groups (SEPGs) and Software Process Improvement
         Networks (SPINs). Industry is adopting standards to assess and improve
         organizational maturity (ISO 9000, SEI CMM) and we should capitalize
         on these developments but not confuse the issues.</p>
       <p>Engaging the process improvement groups might be unconventional but
         they provide leverage. The SEPGs are almost exclusively attended by industry
         practitioners concerned with organization software engineering practices
         and will have something to contribute to the definition of recommended
         individual practices.<br>
   Recommendation 3: Define Ethical Standards</p>
       <p>We recommend to study and customize, if necessary, existing codes already
         adopted by IEEE, ACM, registration boards, and other relevant organizations.
         It is not clear that we need something terribly different or specific
         to software on the grounds that the code of ethics of professionals building
         antennas, processors, or databases should be different. However, due
         perhaps to the rapid expansion of the field, software developers sometimes
         do things that might be considered unethical in other fields (e.g., indiscriminate
         copying of software in violation of copyrights or licenses.) This task
         should be charged to the Committee on Public Policy (COPP) of the Computer
         Society.</p>
       <p>Recommendation 4: Define Educational Curricula</p>
       <p>We recommend the definition of curricula for (a) undergraduate, (b)
         graduate (MS), and (c) continuing education (for retraining and migration).
         This should be charged to an academic task force drawn from educational
         boards within the SEI, ACM and IEEE Computer Society, and relevant affiliate
         societies.</p>
       <p>There is a debate as to whether Software Engineering is a part of Computer
         Science or vice versa. We should not be distracted by this debate from
         the goal of meeting the needs of industry. The education needed by competent
         software engineers could be acquired in different ways. For example,
         we might identify the need for a foundation on statistics; at a given
         school, the courses could be offered by Computer Science, Software Engineering,
         or other departments. The objective is to seek agreement on the curricula
         that should be taught and not necessarily on which departments teach
         it.</p>
       <p>Approach To implement these recommendations the steering committee will
         establish and appoint working committees and task forces as necessary
         to accomplish the steering committee's work. The goal of the steering
         committee is to pose the questions, and consider and document the issues
         involved relating to establishing software engineering as a profession.
         As a part of this, the steering committee will identify the bodies of
         experts who can contribute to this effort.</p>
       <p>Our initial work will concentrate on definitions, education, and technical
         and ethical practices. The four recommendations listed above have implied
         dependencies and they should be implemented in the order suggested. In
         particular, it would be imprudent to develop a set of recommendations
         about curricula that turns out to be inconsistent with recommended practices.
         The knowledge and recommended practices and should be developed first.
         We the required body of knowledge and definition of the required body
         of should be driven by industry needs expect that the industry task force
         would include members from the academic community to provide an education/academic
         perspective to those discussions, but would not overemphasize the education
         area at the expense of the technical area. By the same token, the academic
         task force should include members from the industry community.</p>
       <p>Licensing, certification, and other such regulatory instruments will
         be addressed next. This is a natural continuation to our first set of
         recommendations. Only after we identify the required body of knowledge
         and recommended practices expected of competent software engineers we
         could suggest mechanisms to assess their level of competence</p>
       <p>Another footnote: subsequent to this initial report, the steering committee
         begun the implementation of these recommendations by chartering an industry?led
         task force to define the body of knowledge and recommended practices
         of competent software engineers.</p>

   Subject: Re: First draft of article on steering committee</p>
       <p>Mario, Thanks for the article. It looks fine. Just add at the end of
         the article where you can be reached (addr, phone, fax, email) concerning
         comments and questions. I am sure there will be some! You should also
         provide a title for the article. I will forward your article to Chuck
         Governale (c.governale@compmail.com) the staff editor at Computer who
         will be in touch with you. If you want, you can email the additional
         info to him. Again, thanks for taking the time to provide the article.
         Happy New Year! </p>
       <p>Norm<br>
