       <p align="justify">Software Engineering Ethics Code</p>
       <p align="justify">IEEE-CS/ACM Joint Task Force on Software Engineering
         Ethics and Professional Practices<br>
                       <br>
   Don Gotterbarn, Keith Miller, Simon Rogerson </p>
       <p align="justify">In May of 1993, the Board of Governors of the IEEE?CS
         established a Steering Committee for evaluating, planning, and coordinating
         actions related to establishing software engineering as a profession.
         In that same year the ACM Council endorsed the establishment of a Commission
         on Software Engineering. By January of 1994, both societies formed a
         joint steering committee &quot;To establish the appropriate set(s) of
         standards for professional practice of Software Engineering upon which
         industrial decisions, professional certification, and educational curricula
         can be based.&quot; To accomplish these tasks they made the following
         recommendations:<br>
   1. adopt standard definitions,<br>
   2. define required body of knowledge and recommended practices<br>
   3. define ethical standards<br>
   4. define educational curricula for undergraduate, graduate(MS)<br>
   and continuing education (for retraining and migration).</p>
       <p align="justify">The Steering Committee decided to accomplish these tasks
         through the establishment of a series of task forces. Initially the task
         forces established were: Software Engineering body of knowledge and recommended
         practices; Software Engineering ethics and professional practices, and
         Software Engineering curriculum. </p>
       <p align="justify">The purpose of the Software Engineering ethics and professional
         practices task force is to document the ethical and professional responsibilities
         and obligations of software engineers. This draft code of ethics was
         developed by a task force of the Joint IEEE Computer Society and Association
         for Computing Machinery Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software
         Engineering as a Profession. The task force on Software Engineering Ethics
         and Professional Practices developed this code for a sub?specialization
         within the constituencies of both of the professional societies. In an
         attempt to reflect the international character of both organizations
         and the profession as a whole, the composition of the task force is multinational
         in both citizenship and in membership in professional computing organizations.
         The proposed draft Code of Ethics for Software Engineers ( version 3
         ) was developed by the task force and reviewed<br>
   by the Steering Committee for distribution and comment. The purpose of this
   distribution is to solicit comments from practitioners and other interested
   parties.</p>
       <p align="justify">Codes, if carefully written and properly promoted, can
         be powerful instruments in the drive for Professionalislm and in establishing
         safeguards for society. They do not have to be and should not be sterile
         which is often the perception that people have of them. This draft code
         evolved after extensive study of several computing and engineering codes[1].
         All these codes try to educate and inspire the members of the professional
         group that adopts the code. Codes also inform the public about the responsibilities
         that are important to aprofession. Codes instruct practitioners about
         the standards that society expects them to meet, and what their peers
         strive for and expect of each other. Codes are not meant to encourage
         litigation, and they are not legislation; but they do offer practical
         advice about issues that matter to professionals and their clients and
         they do inform policy makers. These concepts have been adopted in the
         development of this code. Based on the feedback from readers of this
         publication and from other sources, a final draft of the code will be
         developed and presented to the Steering Committee for approval. </p>
