 <p>Don, Here's another one on Draft SE code applied to Gates/Microsoft.</p>
 
                   <p>Since I know you've been studying the computer ethics issues 
 
                     for 
 
                     years, maybe you can give me some guidance that I can pass 
 
                     along to my students?</p>
 
                   <p>I'll be in Virginia Beach at the CSEE&amp;T  
 
                     conference next week. Maybe I'll see you there.</p>
 
                   <p>Pete</p>

                   <p>Thanks, Jeff. Well said.</p>
 
                   <p>Perhaps the control really resides in  
 
                     the laws rather than the ethics codes. Perhaps the ethics 
 
                     codes are just some kind of an outline for future laws?</p>

                   <p> Microsoft's ethics are important because Microsoft is redefining 
 
                     the world. As most computers run MS products, and more and 
 
                     more computers are being installed into more and more aspects 
 
                     of life, Microsoft's philosophy is magnified. The computer 
 
                     domain can be considered a &quot;space&quot; (a new contintent 
 
                     for exploration). As the &quot;shape&quot; of this space is 
 
                     defined by the tools used to access it, it is possible to 
 
                     view the expansion of applications as the colonization of 
 
                     a new world. This world is an aspect of everyday life. Businesses 
 
                     run on it. Schools teach with it. America fuels its dreams 
 
                     of creating a future where the US will remain economically 
 
                     dominant indefinitely with the growth of the computer industry. 
 
                     We are building a &quot;Brave New World&quot;. And the structure 
 
                     set in place will determine how the future starts, and how 
 
                     it will grow. Ethics have been progressively given up to gain 
 
                     power. And as popular perception of ethics seems to redefine 
 
                     itself (instead of being objectively good or bad) the focus 
 
                     on money doesn't seem like such a bad idea. Money has become 
 
                     the quantitative measure of morality. Money defines morality. 
 
                     Gates would certainly argue that all of the questionable tactics 
 
                     his company uses, such as the buyout of competitors and the 
 
                     assimilation of entire new computer industries so they will 
 
                     no longer pose a threat, are merely what is necessary for 
 
                     survival in the modern market economy.</p>
 
                   <p> If Microsoft didn't do it, then Microsoft would lose its 
 
                     dominance (and the benefits of standardization.) As Microsoft 
 
                     has the power, Microsoft can define the rules. And the American 
 
                     public doesn't seem to mind too much. People like MS products 
 
                     -- they offer a lot of functionality for a relatively low 
 
                     price, and components which work together (like MS office) 
 
                     truely do make a lot of tasks easier to do. So even though 
 
                     Microsoft violates the spirit of many of the ethics codes 
 
                     (such as these examples from Gotterbarn), the buyers don't 
 
                     care. And as this is a market economy, profits will be the 
 
                     final arbiter in any type of ethical dispute. Microsoft defintely 
 
                     puts its own self-interest ahead of any other concern, in 
 
                     violation of Gotterbarn's 2.06. Not put self-interest, the 
 
                     interest of an employer, the interest of a client, or the 
 
                     interest of the user ahead of the public's interest.</p>
 
                   <p>The public would of course benefit from better competition, 
 
                     which would allow superior products access to the market. 
 
                     Microsoft specifically plans its strategy to block such superior 
 
                     products. In the case of JAVA, for instance, a product has 
 
                     surfaced which could, if developed further, allow implementation-independant 
 
                     applications to be built. This would get around many of the 
 
                     limitations of modern computing, and if it were fully developed 
 
                     could make a far greater level of standardization of the industry 
 
                     possible. However, Microsoft is using its influence to split 
 
                     JAVA so that instructions which will work on Internet Explorer 
 
                     will not work on other browsers or on other types of machines. 
 
                     The monopolistic nature of Microsoft &quot;locks in&quot; 
 
                     technology at the current level and obliterates attempts to 
 
                     move to the next level. Of course this makes Microsoft even 
 
                     richer and more dominant, so they are able to sell more copies 
 
                     of their software, so they can become more dominant... The 
 
                     cycle continues. But a lot of people are making money (and 
 
                     the people wishing &gt; to change things aren't) so it will 
 
                     be a while before this cycle stops. </p>
 
                   <p> By doing business in this way, Microsoft is defining the 
 
                     rules for future business practices in the software industry 
 
                     and locking in their version of &quot;economic might makes 
 
                     right&quot; morality. But really, in light of the rules of 
 
                     modern business, what kind of company could survive if it 
 
                     wasn't self-centered and profit-centered? A capitalist economy 
 
                     is built on greed. An industrialist economy is built on increasing 
 
                     consumption. There is a coherence here -- one feeds the other. 
 
                     And this will only increase as the world moves to the next 
 
                     phase of the industrial revolution which is the software revolution. 
 
                     Gotterbarn's code 2.06 seems central to all of the other codes. 
 
                     The willingness to hold to any ethical standard means that 
 
                     the ethical standard is more imporant than profits, that honor 
 
                     is more important than immediate gain. And this is what we 
 
                     expect of individuals and corporations in the viscious world 
 
                     of business? </p>
 
                   <p>This kind of code is naieve at best, because all anyone can 
 
                     hope to do with such a thing is define appearances. This may 
 
                     be a directive to Bill to stop making it so obvious that his 
 
                     company is putting its own self-interest first, so he may 
 
                     use the resources and media spotlight available to him to 
 
                     project the image of a kinder, gentler Microsoft. But probably 
 
                     not, because this would only be necessary if he thought any 
 
                     profits depended on it. And of course they don't, because 
 
                     unless there is a fundamental restructuring of how people 
 
                     think about the work they do and the business they transact, 
 
                     people can talk all day about ethics and still buy the least 
 
                     expensive products produced with questionable practices. These 
 
                     codes are only a first step -- a reminder that there are some 
 
                     serious, definable problems with ethics in the software world.</p>
 
                   <p> The environment will not change until people start believing 
 
                     in ethics, until people are willing to experience pain for 
 
                     their ideals, until they are able to make the *ULTIMATE* sacrifice 
 
                     and back up their ideals with their wallets. But of course 
 
                     it is probably too little too late. Now that the ethical dilemma 
 
                     is so glaringly obvious, the trends of the industrialist, 
 
                     capitalist world have become so entrenched that only a moral 
 
                     revolution of some kind could reverse the momentum towards 
 
                     profits and production and turn the focus toward building 
 
                     a more moral world. </p>
