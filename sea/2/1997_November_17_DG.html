                   <p>First, my thanks to you and others on the Task Force for 
 
                     tackling this challenging, but important topic. With the erosion 
 
                     of a common ethic and the increasing importance of software, 
 
                     such a code is vital.</p>
 
                   <p>Please devote some explanation to what a &quot;software engineering&quot; 
 
                     is or to whom the code should apply. Should we expect most 
 
                     programmers, systems analysts, etc. to adhere to the code? 
 
                     That is, is this for all software professionals? Or is just 
 
                     for a relatively small group of leaders (&quot;where the buck 
 
                     stops&quot;), similar to the Professional Engineer, Certified 
 
                     Public Accountant, or M.D.? The first paragraph seems to suggest 
 
                     that it should be applicable to almost all, but the demands 
 
                     on ordinary programmers would be extraordinary.</p>
 
                   <p> Each Principle of this code addresses three levels of ethical 
 
                     obligation owed by professional software engineers in each 
 
                     of these relationships. ... The Clauses of each Principle 
 
                     are illustrations of the various levels of obligation included 
 
                     in that relationship. </p>
 
                   <p>The Clauses under each Principle consist of three different 
 
                     types of statement corresponding to each level. Level One: 
 
                     Aspire ... Level Three: Demand ... The range of statements 
 
                     is from the more general aspirational statement to specific 
 
                     measurable requirements.</p>
 
                   <p>You identify three levels clearly, but why are three paragraphs 
 
                     in the preamble devoted to it? The clauses are not, as far 
 
                     as I can tell, labeled as corresponding to a particular level. 
 
                     Is the professional supposed to decide whether what level 
 
                     a clause is, then be more insistent (demand) or less insistent 
 
                     (aspire) about doing it? (The verbage in level three includes 
 
                     &quot;aspirational,&quot; so makes it harder to decide how 
 
                     clauses should be classified.)</p>
 
                   <p>Since this is e?mail rather than a conversation and I may 
 
                     not have communicated clearly, let me restate. Devoting three 
 
                     paragraphs to levels tells me it is important to understand 
 
                     and apply the concepts, but I really can't see how to classify 
 
                     clauses or how I should view or behavior differently with 
 
                     regard to, say, a level three vs. a level one clause.</p>
 
                   <p>Although all three levels of professional obligation are 
 
                     recognized, the Code is not intended to be all inclusive, 
 
                     nor is it intended that its individual parts be used in isolation 
 
                     to justify errors of omission or commission. ... These ethical 
 
                     tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful consideration 
 
                     of fundamental principles, ...</p>
 
                   <p>Excellent paragraphs.</p>
 
                   <p align="center"> <strong>PRINCIPLE 1: PRODUCT </strong></p>
 
                   <p>Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, ensure that 
 
                     the software on which they work is useful and of acceptable 
 
                     quality to the public, the employer, the client, and the user;</p>
 
                   <p>I am not clear on the differences between these four groups. 
 
                     Perhaps a simple scenario would be helpful as a footnote or 
 
                     in the preamble. The employer pays for and directs your work. 
 
                     The client commissions the work. The user uses the work. The 
 
                     public are those not directly involved. Suppose a bank hires 
 
                     the software firm you work for to develop a program for tellers. 
 
                     The bank is the client. The software firm is the employer. 
 
                     A teller is a user (or is the person seeing the teller a user, 
 
                     too?). The public includes the person do banking with the 
 
                     teller, accountants, competitors, and the rest of humanity. 
 
                     Defining and using terms consistently is an important part 
 
                     of a code. Otherwise, how can we talk about the same thing?</p>
 
                   <p>1.01. Ensure that specifications for software on which they 
 
                     work have been well documented, satisfy the user's requirements, 
 
                     and have the client's approval. strongly favor</p>
 
                   <p>1.02. Strive to fully understand the specifications for software 
 
                     on which they work. strongly favor</p>
 
                   <p>1.03. Ensure that they are qualified, by an appropriate combination 
 
                     of education and experience, for any project on which they 
 
                     work or propose to work. uncertain We all expect to do some 
 
                     learning on at least some jobs. How about &quot;Ensure that 
 
                     they are not unqualified...&quot; or &quot;adequately qualified&quot;? 
 
                     Was the developer of the Therac-25 software unqualified or 
 
                     just did a poor job? Can we expect software engineers to know 
 
                     their limitations with respect to the state of the art in 
 
                     all areas? If someone approached me to write an accounting 
 
                     package, I'd probably feel comfortable accepting as long as 
 
                     I inform them that I needed specifications to include proper 
 
                     accounting practices and audits since I have little training 
 
                     or experience in that area.</p>
 
                   <p>A side comment: some clauses, such as 1.01 and 1.02, refer 
 
                     to &quot;software on which they work&quot; while other clauses, 
 
                     such as 1.03 and 1.04, refer to &quot;project on which they 
 
                     work.&quot; If there is little or no distinction, the code 
 
                     should only use one term consistently. If there is a distinction, 
 
                     perhaps it could be mentioned. (It looks like I'm suggesting 
 
                     a glossary of sorts.)</p>
 
                   <p> 1.04. Ensure proper and achievable goals and objectives 
 
                     for any project on which they work or propose. strongly favor</p>
 
                   <p> 1.05. Ensure an appropriate methodology for any project 
 
                     on which they work or propose to work. favor With the general 
 
                     lack of widely accepted methodologies, I would feel more comfortable 
 
                     with &quot;adequate.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p>1.06. Ensure good management for any project on which they 
 
                     work,including effective procedures for promotion of quality 
 
                     and reduction of risk. uncertain Is this directed primarily 
 
                     to managers, or should everyone be expected to campaign against 
 
                     poor management they may be subject to? Unless the professional 
 
                     has input into management, I think going beyond reporting 
 
                     possible risks is too much to expect. Besides, there is a 
 
                     whole principle for management.</p>
 
                   <p> 1.07. Ensure realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, personnel, 
 
                     and outcome on any project on which they work or propose to 
 
                     work and provide a risk assessment of these estimates. strongly 
 
                     favor</p>
 
                   <p>1.08. Ensure adequate documentation on any project on which 
 
                     they work, including a log of problems discovered and solutions 
 
                     adopted. strongly favor first clause oppose last clause If 
 
                     a problem has been solved, why should it be explicitly documented? 
 
                     How about &quot;including a list of resolved problems and 
 
                     any possible solutions or ways to avoid them&quot;?</p>
 
                   <p> 1.09. Ensure adequate testing, debugging, and review of 
 
                     software and related documents on which they work. strongly 
 
                     favor</p>
 
                   <p> 1.10. Work to develop software and related documents that 
 
                     respect the privacy of those who will be subjected to that 
 
                     software. uncertain Are these the clients mentioned earlier? 
 
                     Or the users? Or the public? (&quot;subjected&quot; is a very 
 
                     emotionally charged word.) I don't see how software documentation 
 
                     can possibly violate someone's privacy (unless they are used 
 
                     as an example in a training manual.) How about Ensure that 
 
                     the software respects the privacy all concerned. </p>
 
                   <p>1.11. Be careful to use only accurate data derived from legal 
 
                     sources, and use only in ways properly authorized. strongly 
 
                     favor I'd like to see &quot;ethical&quot; in addition to &quot;legal.&quot; 
 
                     Some things may not be against the law, but not be ethical. 
 
                     In fact, much data collection today is legal, but invades 
 
                     the privacy of the public.</p>
 
                   <p>Should this be broadened to cover operating legally? For 
 
                     instance, a patented algorithm may be used illegally and it 
 
                     only very loosely can be considered not in the spirit of 1.11 
 
                     since it refers to data.</p>
 
                   <p>1.12. Whenever appropriate, delete outdated or flawed data

                     should be obtained, maintained, and used legally, ethically, 
 
                     and accurately.</p>

                     sectence, favor Should I make any tradeoffs clear to the public? 
 
                     Does that mean that everyone at Microsoft (and most of the 
 
                     rest of the industry) is acting unethically because they don't 
 
                     make it clear to the public that quality is being traded off 
 
                     for profit and features? The public generally believes that 
 
                     better quality is unattainable, even though everyone is sick 
 
                     of crashing programs.</p>

                     This is a near?duplicate of 2.03, and this doesn't have &quot;with

                     terms) is a part of the culture in many South American countries. 
 
                     This may be hard to get agreement on.</p>
 
                   <p> How about &quot;Do not accept, use, or condone the use of

                     party to a contract&quot; seems odd. I think it should be 
 
                     &quot;party outside the contract&quot; since I'm sure contracts 
 
                     can have fourth and fifth parties, too.</p>

                     Why is this phrased differently? &quot;when the circumstances 
 
                     have been fully disclosed to parties concerned and they have

                     I like the phrasing of 3.04 better.</p>
 
                   <p>3.06. Disclose to all concerned parties those conflicts of 
 
                     interest that cannot reasonably be avoided or escaped and 
 
                     aspire to resolve them. strongly agree</p>
 
                   <p>3.07. Refuse to participate in any decision of a governmental

                     or their client have a financial interest. disagree The government 
 
                     or professional body almost always has a financial interest. 
 
                     If &quot;they&quot; means the professional, this significantly 
 
                     overlaps with 3.06 and is related to 3.03. Maybe this could 
 
                     be worded more clearly.</p>

                     their own judgment above obedience to the law. Granted this 
 
                     must occur in extreme cases, but this clause is much too strong. 
 
                     Perhaps just &quot;Obey all laws governing their work&quot; 
 
                     is enough, and let general statements such as &quot;standards 
 
                     may conflict with each other&quot; and &quot;consistent with 
 
                     public health, safety, and welfare&quot; in Principles 2, 
 
                     4, and 6 invoke the rare exceptions. After all, we don't tack 
 
                     the clause onto 5.02, 5.06, 6.01, etc. where conflicts may 
 
                     arise.</p>
 
                   <p> I believe we must encourage obedience to the law even if 
 
                     it may occasionally be contrary to what we perceive as public 
 
                     health, safety, and welfare. A lawless society is a much greater 
 
                     danger than laws requiring one to harm public health, safety, 
 
                     and welfare.</p>
 
                   <p>How about a clause about working to improve or enact laws 
 
                     to bring about a legal environment conducive to the good development 
 
                     and use of software?</p>
 
                   <p>6.11. Exercise professional responsibility to society by 
 
                     constructively serving in civic affairs. I strongly agree 
 
                     with the concept, but disagree that it should be part of the 
 
                     code. This seems to be a responsibility of every human and 
 
                     is in no way unique to software engineers or their products. 
 
                     2.08 seems to cover the professional's (unique) contribution 
 
                     to society.</p>
 
                   <p>6.12. Promote public knowledge of software engineering. agree</p>
 
                   <p> 6.13. Share useful software?related knowledge, inventions, 
 
                     or discoveries with the profession, for example, by presenting 
 
                     papers at professional meetings, by publishing articles in 
 
                     the technical press, and by serving on the profession's standard?setting 
 
                     bodies. uncertain This may often be difficult in light of 
 
                     4.03, 4.05, and 4.09. Maybe a clause about &quot;as long as 
 
                     it doesn't violate confidences or proprietary knowledge&quot;?</p>

                   <p> 7.02. Review the work of other software engineers, which

                     provided this is consistent with public health, safety, and

                     and properly documented way. strongly agree Switch this with 
 
                     7.03 so the clauses about reviewing are together.</p>
 
                   <p>7.05. Give a fair hearing to the opinion, concern, or complaint 
 
                     of a colleague. agree</p>
 
                   <p> 7.06. Assist colleagues in being fully aware of current

                     of any colleague. agree</p>
 
                   <p> 7.08. Not undermine another software engineer's job prospects 
 
                     for one's own personal gain. uncertain Suppose I am competing 
 
                     with another SE for a job which could use a lot of C++ experience. 
 
                     If I have a lot more experience than she does, I don't see 
 
                     the problem with pointing out my greater experience to improve 
 
                     my chances of getting the job (personal gain) and lessening 
 
                     hers (undermining her job prospects). How about something 
 
                     like &quot;Not undermine with false, distorted, or irrelevant 
 
                     information another SE's job prospects ...&quot;?</p>

                     call &gt; upon the opinions of other professionals who have 
 
                     competence in that &gt; area. agree</p>
