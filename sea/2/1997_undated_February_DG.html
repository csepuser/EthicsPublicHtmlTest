                   <p>PROPOSED SCHEDULE AND TASK FORCE STRUCTURE v.1.0</p>
 
                   <p>The schedule below is designed as an attempt to meet the 
 
                     Steering Committee's request that this project be completed 
 
                     by December 1997.</p>
 
                   <p>General comment: </p>
 
                   <p>As can be seen by the schedule below, if completion by Dec 
 
                     1997 means completion of the code which reflects a consensus 
 
                     of those concerned then it is a very tight schedule. Another 
 
                     concern is that the code ought to be reflective of the results 
 
                     of the other tasks forces and so satisfactory completion of 
 
                     the code and statements of practice is tied to the progress 
 
                     of the other task forces.</p>
 
                   <p> The schedule below reflects the techniques we used to achieve 
 
                     consensus on the ACM code and make clear to the members of 
 
                     the society that the code did represent that consensus. </p>

                   <p>= 2 ==================================== </p>
 
                   <p>Proposed Task Force Structure: </p>
 
                   <p>A balanced code will address, the engineering, the management 
 
                     and the academic facets of software engineering. The structure 
 
                     of the task reflects that balance. Rather than partitioning 
 
                     the leadership along professional association membership lines, 
 
                     the executive committee represents three areas that need to 
 
                     be represented in the code; a software engineering coordinator 
 
                     and a technical management coordinator. The previous organization 
 
                     of the SEEPP task force divided the group along lines of ethical 
 
                     issues into separate working groups. This was not productive. 
 
                     The proposed structure of a single panel of experts allows 
 
                     individual experts to contribute where their specialty is 
 
                     involved. </p>
 
                   <p>The panel includes members from several professional societies 
 
                     including; the ACM, the IEEE-CS, the ICCP, the BCS, IEE, IDP 
 
                     and the Deutsche Gesellshaft Fur Informatik. It also includes 
 
                     practicing software engineers and ethics advisors for major, 
 
                     multinational corporations. The panel also has an international 
 
                     representation from places such as Egypt, England, Germany, 
 
                     and Scotland. </p>

                   </p>
 
                   <p>The Functions of Professional Codes in an Emerging Profession: 
 
                     A Hierarchy of Functions</p>
 
                   <p></p>
 
                   <p>It is important for emerging professions to develop a code 
 
                     of ethics. There are divergent views about such codes. From 
 
                     a negative standpoint some have argued that such codes are 
 
                     merely an attempt to generate a positive public image. </p>
 
                   <p>Others claim that such codes merely establish a moral minimum 
 
                     and are incomplete. As an emerging profession develops a code 
 
                     it is important to keep these negative judgements in mind, 
 
                     but it is equally important to consider the functions of codes. 
 
                     Since some of these functions may be incompatible it is also 
 
                     important to identify and to emphasize those characteristics 
 
                     of a code which are most relevant to the particular profession.</p>
 
                   <p>Many professional societies, such as the British Computer 
 
                     Society, use a hierarchy of code types. They distinguish between 
 
                     codes of ethics, of conduct, and of practice. The failure 
 
                     to distinguish between the structure and roles of these different 
 
                     types of code has often led to confusion when interpreting 
 
                     the code(s) of a professional organization. Some codes embody 
 
                     elements from all three types without clearly distinguishing 
 
                     which role a particular imperative is supposed to serve. </p>
 
                   <p>The relationship between these types of code form a hierarchy. 
 
                     Codes of ethics as distinguished from codes of conduct and 
 
                     codes of practice are more aspirational. They are mission 
 
                     statements for the professional providing, vision and objectives. 
 
                     Codes of conduct are more oriented toward the professional 
 
                     and professional attitudes. They do not describe details about 
 
                     how to carry out a particular action, but they make clear 
 
                     the issues at stake in different specialized fields, such 
 
                     as telecommunications and software construction.</p>
 
                   <p> Codes of practice may fix some accepted state of the art 
 
                     ( Berleur, J) and relate to current operational activities. 
 
                     Although each of these roles for a code is both normative 
 
                     and prescriptive, one cannot expect the same level of enforcement 
 
                     for each role. </p>
 
                   <p>Codes of ethics, which are primarily aspirational, use no 
 
                     more than light coercion, while codes of conduct violations 
 
                     generally carry sanctions ranging from warnings to exclusion 
 
                     from the professional body. Codes of practice violations may 
 
                     lead to legal action on the grounds of malpractice or negligence. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>This hierarchy of codes parallels the three levels of professional 
 
                     ethics. At level 1, all professionals, by virtue of their 
 
                     humanity share a common set of values with other human beings, 
 
                     for example honesty and integrity. By virtue of their role 
 
                     as professionals and their special skills, they owe a higher 
 
                     order of care when working in their field than would be owed 
 
                     if they were not professionals. </p>
 
                   <p>This second level of ethical obligation is also shared by 
 
                     every professional. The third level of professional ethics 
 
                     is the set of distinct ethical obligations and their structure 
 
                     within the context of a particular profession. Professional 
 
                     codes of ethics need to address all three of these levels. 
 
                     (Gotterbarn 94) </p>
 
                   <p>Several professional societies in their codes and associated 
 
                     documentation together with authors on ethics have distinguished 
 
                     several functions and audiences for professional codes of 
 
                     ethics. A matrix, whose vertical axis is the different roles 
 
                     of code and whose horizontal axis consists of the significant 
 
                     functions of t he code for the emerging profession, can be 
 
                     used in the development of a professional code. </p>
 
                   <p>The following categories encompass the functions of the codes 
 
                     indicated by professional societies and authors on professional 
 
                     issues for engineers and computers scientists.</p>
 
                   <p>INSPIRATION </p>
 
                   <p>Codes might be designed to be inspirational. There are two 
 
                     audiences for such inspiration. Martin [Martin 89] emphasizes 
 
                     the inspiration for &quot;positive stimulus for ethical conduct 
 
                     by the practitioner&quot;, while Johnson [Johnson 1995] emphasizes 
 
                     a code's function to inspire confidence of the customer or 
 
                     user in the computing artifact and its creator. The use of 
 
                     language with positive overtones helps to generate both types 
 
                     of inspiration but such language also introduces a degree 
 
                     of vagueness which limits the ability of the code to help 
 
                     guide professional behavior.</p>
 
                   <p> Thus the inspirational function of a code has implications 
 
                     for the physical structure of a code. Although some people 
 
                     prefer brief codes, many have argued that a code which is 
 
                     both brief and inspirational really provides little guidance 
 
                     for behavior. To address this problem, organizations like 
 
                     the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology, American 
 
                     Society of Civil Engineers, and the Association for Computing 
 
                     Machinery have developed codes which are accompanied by a 
 
                     set of guidelines which can appear separately or intermeshed 
 
                     with the basic imperatives.</p>
 
                   <p>GUIDANCE </p>
 
                   <p>Historically, there has been a transition away from regulatory 
 
                     codes designed to penalize divergent behavior and internal 
 
                     dissent, toward codes which are more normative. Such normative 
 
                     codes are only a partial representation of the ethical standards 
 
                     of the profession's members.(Anderson 1994, Gotterbarn 1996) 
 
                     These more normative codes are not considered as exhaustive 
 
                     lists of rights or wrongs; nor are they considered algorithms 
 
                     to decide what is wrong. </p>
 
                   <p>The use of normative codes requires moral judgement on the 
 
                     part of professional. Professional societies provide help 
 
                     in difficult moral cases; the American Bar Association publishes 
 
                     opinions on difficult cases and the Board of Ethical Review 
 
                     of the National Society of Professional Engineers publishes 
 
                     opinions on how their code can be applied to specific cases. 
 
                     A sense of moral responsibility is needed for the application 
 
                     of a code to concrete situations.</p>
 
                   <p>EDUCATION </p>
 
                   <p>Most authorities on codes emphasize the educational function 
 
                     of codes. They serve to educate, both prospective and existing 
 
                     members of a particular profession about the shared commitment 
 
                     of the members of a particular profession to undertake a certain 
 
                     quality work and the responsibility for the well being of 
 
                     the customer and user of the developed product. </p>
 
                   <p> They also serve to educate managers of the groups of professionals 
 
                     about expected behavior. A manager's expectations will have 
 
                     an effect on what is asked of a professional. Directly and 
 
                     indirectly codes educate management about their responsibility 
 
                     for the effects and impacts of the products developed.</p>
 
                   <p> Codes also serve as indirectly educating the public at large 
 
                     about what the professionals consider to be a minimal acceptable 
 
                     practice in that field, even if practiced by a non-professional. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>SUPPORT FOR POSITIVE ACTION </p>
 
                   <p>Codes provide a level of support for the professional who 
 
                     decides to take positive action. They provide an environment 
 
                     in which it will be easier than it would otherwise be to resist 
 
                     pressure to do what the professional would rather not do. 
 
                     The appeal to the imperatives of a code can be used as a counter 
 
                     pressure of the urging by others to have the professional 
 
                     act in ways inconsistent with a pattern of behavior supported 
 
                     by a consensus of that profession. The effectiveness of such 
 
                     appeals are related to the type of sanctions related to violations 
 
                     of the code. </p>
 
                   <p>For example doctors are encouraged to write prescriptions 
 
                     in accordance with legal guidelines. Recent failures to follow 
 
                     these standards has recently led to 900 physicians no longer 
 
                     being allowed to write prescriptions.</p>
 
                   <p> DETERRENCE AND DISCIPLINE </p>
 
                   <p>This is the other side of the support for positive action. 
 
                     Codes can serve as a formal basis for action against a professional. 
 
                     Some organizations revoke membership or suspend licenses to 
 
                     practice.</p>
 
                   <p>ENHANCE PROFESSION'S PUBLIC IMAGE</p>
 
                   <p> Some codes specify a minimal standard of conduct. Sometimes 
 
                     this is done at great ethical cost. Codes have been used to 
 
                     prohibit public criticism of fellow professionals even if 
 
                     they violated some ethical standard Some codes emphasize blind 
 
                     loyalty to the company or client without recognition that 
 
                     such loyalty often conflicts with other imperatives of a code, 
 
                     such as &quot;cause no harm&quot;.</p>
 
                   <p>For an emerging profession, some of these functions are more 
 
                     critical than others. The choice of functions will give the 
 
                     code its own character. The support function is very important, 
 
                     because many software engineering projects are team projects 
 
                     and the software engineer is not always in a decision making 
 
                     position. Since the profession is an emerging one, the educational 
 
                     and inspirational functions are also important.</p>
 
                   <p> At this stage of software engineering's evolution, the disciplinary 
 
                     function is being taken over by the law in the United States. 
 
                     In most contemporary codes, the attempt to keep a perfect 
 
                     public image at the expense of quality development has been 
 
                     abandoned. For example both the IEEE-CS and ACM codes require 
 
                     that a professional encourages adherence to the code and calls 
 
                     attention to significant violations of the code. </p>
 
                   <p>Thus, it is the first four functions which should be addressed 
 
                     in the development of a software engineering code of ethics.

                   <p>The Architecture of the Draft Software Engineering Code of 
 
                     Ethics and Its Relations to other Codes of Ethics Gotterbarn 
 
                     &amp; Rogerson Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility</p>
 
                   <p>This document was developed in response to a request for 
 
                     the IEEE- CS/ACM Joint Steering Committee for The Professionalization 
 
                     of Software Engineering. The architecture of the draft Software 
 
                     Engineering Code of Ethics (SECEv1) has been modified in the 
 
                     light of comments from the software engineering and computer 
 
                     ethics communities. It should be noted that we use the term 
 
                     software engineer to include the entire software engineering 
 
                     community; those software engineers practicing in the private 
 
                     and public sector and those in software engineering education. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>The structure of SECEv1 was modeled on the format of the 
 
                     National Society of Professional Engineers Code of Ethics(NSPE) 
 
                     in so far as it addresses the various ethical responsibilities 
 
                     of the professional in terms of the particular relationships 
 
                     in which the professional stands. Thus the first version was 
 
                     organized around the software engineer's obligations in product 
 
                     development, obligations to the public, obligations to use 
 
                     professional judgement, obligations to the client and the 
 
                     employer, obligations to the profession of software engineering, 
 
                     obligations to colleagues, and obligation to self as a practicing 
 
                     professional.</p>
 
                   <p> Each of these relationships carry different ethical obligations 
 
                     and the practicing professional must be cognizant of all of 
 
                     these obligations. Following the NSPE code closely led to 
 
                     many of the statements in the SECEv1 closely resembling statements 
 
                     in NSPE (See attached table below for details of this relationship).</p>
 
                   <p>The SEEPP task force then examined other codes including: 
 
                     The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, The IEEE 
 
                     Code of Ethics, Project Management Institute Code of Ethics 
 
                     for the Project Management Profession,. American Institute 
 
                     of Certified Public Accountants Professional Standards Manual, 
 
                     PA State Registration Board of Professional Engineers, Land 
 
                     Surveyors and Geologists The Code of Ethics and the Law, and 
 
                     The Unwritten Laws of Engineering by W. J. King American Society 
 
                     of Mechanical Engineers. The members of the task force used 
 
                     these and other codes as models for elements that they thought 
 
                     ought to be included in a code of ethics for software engineers.</p>
 
                   <p>SECEv1 was then distributed beyond the committee for comment. 
 
                     In the light of those comments and further work by the task 
 
                     force, the structure of the code has been revised to reflect 
 
                     more closely some significant aspects of other engineering 
 
                     and computing codes that were not included in SECEv1.</p>
 
                   <p>Many codes, such as the British Computer Society's Code of 
 
                     Conduct and Code of Practice, and the ACM's Code of Ethics 
 
                     and Professional conduct, include a preamble describing the 
 
                     roles and functions of the code for the practicing professional. 
 
                     These generally include a description of the use of the code 
 
                     and some very high level ethical imperatives. They also make 
 
                     clear that codes of ethics are to be used as guidelines for 
 
                     conduct and not as exhaustive lists of the ethical obligations 
 
                     of professionals. </p>
 
                   <p>For example the preamble to the British Computer Society 
 
                     Code of Practice states &quot;The Code is to be viewed as 
 
                     a whole. Individual parts are not intended to be used in isolation 
 
                     to justify errors of omission or commission. The Code is intended 
 
                     to be observed in the spirit and not merely in the word.&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>One of the ways to avoid this misunderstanding of reading 
 
                     the code as an ethics checklist is to organize the code into 
 
                     a hierarchy of Cannons, Rules, Principles, or Ethical Imperatives 
 
                     which form the top level of a hierarchy and then attach at 
 
                     lower levels guidelines which by way of example make clear 
 
                     the intent of the top level principles. The structure of SECEv1 
 
                     has been revised in accordance with this model. </p>
 
                   <p>SECEv2 starts with a preamble explaining the roles and functions 
 
                     of the code. In this version, Principle Colleagues was sub-divided 
 
                     into Principle Colleagues and Principle Managemen to form 
 
                     8 principlest. The Preamble is followed by the set of 8 principles 
 
                     based on the relationship in which a software engineer has 
 
                     ethical obligations. These principles are tied to key words 
 
                     indicating the relationship. The use of key words is a powerful 
 
                     memory guide for the code.</p>
 
                   <p> Limiting the main body of the code to these eight principles 
 
                     will make it easier to remember and make the code more reflective 
 
                     of the impact of changing technology on the breadth of ethical 
 
                     obligations of the practicing software engineer. For each 
 
                     principle there are several specific examples (many drawn 
 
                     from other professional engineering and computer codes) which 
 
                     show what these principles require when put in practice.</p>
 
                   <p> This division of the code makes it consistent with the three 
 
                     levels of professional obligation defined in &quot;Functions 
 
                     of Codes of Ethics&quot;(attached), namely the code contains 
 
                     level 1 ethical obligations based on the humanity of the professional, 
 
                     level 2 ethical obligations based on the higher order of care 
 
                     due by all professionals, and level 3 obligations which are 
 
                     tied directly to the practice of the profession. </p>
 
                   <p>As other professions have realized, in developing a code 
 
                     one cannot leave out obligations that are common to all professions 
 
                     and only consider level three- software engineering practice- 
 
                     obligations. To leave out level 1 and level 2 obligations 
 
                     reduces software engineering from a profession to a technical 
 
                     practice The revised structure within SECEv2 makes the code 
 
                     comprehensive in that it includes both generic items and profession 
 
                     specific items. Anything short of this would be meaningless 
 
                     and useless in the emergence of software engineering as a 
 
                     profession. </p>
 
                   <p>The following table compares 12 different codes of ethics, 
 
                     conduct and practice to the preliminary version of the Software 
 
                     Engineering Code of Ethics(SECEv1). In the 12 codes, four 
 
                     are from computer organizations, five from engineering organizations 
 
                     and the IEEE code which also covers the IEEE-CS.</p>
 
                   <p>The original purpose of documenting the architecture of the 
 
                     code to show which parts are derived from other codes and 
 
                     which parts are unique to software engineering presumed that 
 
                     there are clear lines of demarcation between engineering, 
 
                     computing, and software engineering. The results of this study 
 
                     into computing and engineering codes of ethics are not consistent 
 
                     with that presumption. </p>
 
                   <p>Several studies have shown that codes of ethics operate on 
 
                     many levels. On the highest level-imperatives grounded in 
 
                     our common humanity-- most codes contain ethical principles 
 
                     of honesty and integrity(Level 1). SECEv1 has this kind of 
 
                     imperative in common with all of the other codes examined. 
 
                     Professional codes of ethics also have in common the professional's 
 
                     commitment to a higher level of care(Level 2). These obligations 
 
                     of all professions and practicing professionals are stated 
 
                     in terms of commitment to the public interest over self-interest. 
 
                     Again all of the codes have similar imperatives about professionals 
 
                     having a higher order of obligation to the public they serve 
 
                     rather than having the kind of moral obligation demanded of 
 
                     the general public. </p>
 
                   <p>The major difference between codes occurs at level 3; the 
 
                     statement of obligations specific to a particular profession. 
 
                     Some imperative may be stated in terms of level 1 in one code 
 
                     while they are stated at level 3 in another code. For example 
 
                     Rule 7 of SECEv1 is compared with IEEE 6. </p>
 
                   <p>IEEE 6 states the professional obligation &quot;...to maintain 
 
                     and improve technical competence and to undertake technological 
 
                     tasks for others only if qualified by training or experience.&quot; 
 
                     while Rule 7 addresses the same moral obligation at level 
 
                     3 and talks about more specific competencies within the practice 
 
                     of software engineering. 7.0-7.6 are software engineering 
 
                     specific (level 3) obligations to maintain knowledge in particular 
 
                     software engineering areas. Most of the cross references for 
 
                     7.0-7.6 refer to a single level 2 admonition to &quot; keep 
 
                     current in your profession&quot;. The difference between codes 
 
                     occurring primarily at level 3 also helps explain the sparse 
 
                     number of cross references to Rule 1 SECEv1 which is software 
 
                     product specific.</p>
 
                   <p>Most of the imperatives in SECv1 are in several of the codes 
 
                     of ethics used for comparison. At the moment some imperatives 
 
                     are contained mostly in engineering codes (the outer columns 
 
                     of the chart) and some imperatives are contained mostly in 
 
                     computing codes (the inner columns of the chart). Those elements 
 
                     which currently are sparsely reflected in engineering and 
 
                     computer codes have to do with management issues and some 
 
                     very specific imperatives, some of which are technical issues 
 
                     in software engineering. As the code develops, to include 
 
                     elements that recognize the role of teams in software engineering, 
 
                     there will be more elements at level 3 which distinguish SECEv2 
 
                     from both computing and engineering codes.</p>
 
                   <p>= 5 ================</p>
 
                   <p>Dear Steering Committee Members:</p>
 
                   <p>Below is a copy of the main body of code of ethics which 
 
                     has been modified 
 
                     to address reviews received from a several of sources. The 
 
                     changes to the 
 
                     Preamble are being worked on now, so a revised one is not 
 
                     included in this 
 
                     document.. </p>
 
                   <p>The architecture of the code v2.0 is similar to version 1.0. 
 
                     It starts out with a preamble or introduction explaining the 
 
                     functions of the code and guidelines on its use. This is followed 
 
                     by a series of keyword principles describing a software engineer's 
 
                     obligations in a variety of relationships. Associated with 
 
                     each of these keyword principles is a high level description 
 
                     of the software engineer's obligations.</p>
 
                   <p> These Principles are each followed by a series of clauses 
 
                     detailing some of the obligations under this Principle. These 
 
                     obligations are taken from all three levels of obligation 
 
                     in a professional code of ethics- level 1 representing obligations 
 
                     shared with all other human beings, level 2 obligations which 
 
                     are shared by all professionals, level 3 obligations which 
 
                     are specific to software engineering. ( See item 3 above -Functions 
 
                     of Codes of Ethics for a discussion of these 3 levels and 
 
                     there relation to professional standards.)</p>
 
                   <p>The architecture of this code, major principles, followed 
 
                     by explanations or examples in clauses, is fairly common, 
 
                     e.g., it is used by the NSPE and the British Computer Society. 
 
                     The use of an explanatory Preamble to explain the role of 
 
                     the code and instructions that the code should not be considered 
 
                     as a complete list of professional ethical obligations is 
 
                     also quite common. For example, all codes used in the architecture 
 
                     table (of item 2 above) follow this format. The Code v2.0 
 
                     differs from most other codes in two ways. First, the code 
 
                     is different in its use of keyword Principles indicating obligations 
 
                     based on professional relationships. </p>
 
                   <p>Some codes, like the Australian Computer Society Code of 
 
                     Ethics, also use keyword principles. This Code v2.0 differs 
 
                     from the Australian code in that the Code's keywords are tied 
 
                     to professional relationships. Papers and books on computer 
 
                     ethics have found this organization, an organization around 
 
                     the relationships in which a professional finds his/herself, 
 
                     useful in covering the topics of professionalism and useful 
 
                     as a good nmonic device. The code also differs from other 
 
                     codes by clearly addressing, in the preamble, the difference 
 
                     between the three levels of professional obligation and organizing 
 
                     the clauses under each principle around these three levels. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p> IN TERMS OF YOUR REFLECTION AND COMMENT ON THIS CODE IT 
 
                     IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE WORKING PAPER TO SEE WHAT CHANGES 
 
                     WERE MADE AND WHY THEY WERE MADE. </p>

                     completed on time and at reasonable cost, and free of error. 
 
                     In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>

                     <p> 1.07. Ensure realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, 
 
                       personnel, and outcome on any project on which they work 
 
                       or propose to work. </p>
 
                     <p>1.08. Ensure adequate documentation on any project on which 
 
                       they work, including a log of problems discovered and solutions 
 
                       adopted. </p>
 
                     <p>1.09. Ensure adequate testing, debugging, and review of 
 
                       software and related documents on which they work. </p>
 
                     <p>1.10. Aspire to develop software and related documents 
 
                       that respect the privacy of those who will be subjected 
 
                       to that software.</p>
 
                     <p> 1.11 Be careful to use only accurate data derived from

                       the client, the user, and the public and make any tradeoffs 
 
                       clear to all parties concerned. </p>
 
                     <p>1.14. Aspire to follow industry standards that are most 
 
                       appropriate for the task at hand, departing from these only 
 
                       when technically justified. </p>

                   <p>Software engineers shall, in their professional role, act 
 
                     only in ways consistent with the public safety, health and 
 
                     welfare. In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
 
                   <blockquote>
 
                     <p> 2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any

                       belief that it is safe, meets specifications, has passed 
 
                       appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality of life
