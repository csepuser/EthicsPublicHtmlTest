      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" -->Dear 
 
                   Steering Committee: 
 
                   <p>PROJECT MANAGEMENT STATUS REPORT:</p>
 
                   <p>We need your response. On February 13th the SEEPP task force 
 
                     forwarded to you a revised code of ethics, a schedule for 
 
                     completing the 
 
                     project in a timely fashion and several supporting documents 
 
                     requested 
 
                     by Steering committee members. </p>
 
                   <p>In order for the SEEPP Task Force to continue to move forward 
 
                     we need from you, </p>
 
                   <p>1) your comments on the code,</p>
 
                   <p> 2) approval for the establishment of a web site.</p>
 
                   <p> 3) approval to distribute the code for comment using society 
 
                     journals,</p>
 
                   <p>We have not received any comments on the code from you, so 
 
                     can we 
 
                     presume that we are getting closer to the mark with the code 
 
                     and that 
 
                     the explanations of the changes were satisfactory?</p>
 
                   <p>The proposal to use the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility 
 
                     as the central web site was rejected and we were told to use 
 
                     the IEEE 
 
                     and ACM web sites. I have received no response to my request 
 
                     for the 
 
                     names of contacts at those web sites who have been advised 
 
                     to co- 
 
                     operate with this effort. Has the ACM and IEEE agreed to allow 
 
                     us to 
 
                     use their sites and if so are the contacts.</p>
 
                   <p>I have also requested Steering Committee permission to distribute 
 
                     the 
 
                     draft code for preliminary comment in two ACM newsletters. 
 
                     I  
 
                     requested permission to distribute the code in these newsletters 
 
                     in time 
 
                     for the publication to occur in the Summer of 1997. These 
 
                     newsletter 
 
                     have publication deadlines. The deadline for the SIGCAS Newsletter 
 
                     has already passed, but the editor is willing to accept the 
 
                     document if I 
 
                     can get it in by the end of this week. If we miss these deadlines, 
 
                     then 
 
                     the earliest he draft could appear would be September.</p>
 
                   <p>The project is at a stand still. The time specifically dedicated 
 
                     to this 
 
                     project is being used waiting for approval to move forward. 
 
                     Small 
 
                     delays now will cause large delays in the completion of the 
 
                     project. I 
 
                     know you are all quite busy, but we are simply asking permission 
 
                     to 
 
                     continue the iterative development process. We would like 
 
                     to distribute 
 
                     the preliminary code for broader review by those who will 
 
                     be guided by 
 
                     it and affected by it.</p>
 
                   <p>The document we are interested in circulating is attached 
 
                     below for your 
 
                     review. Thank you for your timely response. </p>
 
                   <p>Sincerely,</p>
 
                   <p>Donald Gotterbarn</p>
 
                   <p>p.s. There have been some modifications suggested since version 
 
                     2.0.  
 
                     The changes are indicated by phases in upper case.</p>
 
                   <p>=========================================</p>
 
                   <p> Proposed Product for Publication</p>
 
                   <p>This draft code of ethics was developed by a task force of 
 
                     the Joint IEEE Computer Society and Association for Computing 
 
                     Machinery Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software 
 
                     Engineering as a Profession. </p>
 
                   <p>The task force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional 
 
                     Practices developed this code for a sub-specialization within 
 
                     the constituencies of both of the professional societies. 
 
                     In an attempt to reflect the international character of both 
 
                     organizations and the profession itself, the composition of 
 
                     the task force is multinational in bot citizenship and in 
 
                     membership in professional computing organizations. The proposed 
 
                     draft Code of Ethics for Software Engineers ( version 2.0a) 
 
                     was developed by the task force and reviewed by the Steering 
 
                     Commitee.</p>
 
                   <p>Based on the feedback from readers of this publication and 
 
                     from other 
 
                     sources, a final draft of the code will be developed and presented 
 
                     to the 
 
                     Steering Committee for aproval. </p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS v 2.0a April 1997</p>
 
                   <p>PREAMBLE v 2.0a </p>
 
                   <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, 
 
                     industry, 
 
                     government, medicine, education, entertainment, social affairs, 
 
                     and 
 
                     ordinary life. Those who contribute, by direct participation 
 
                     or by 
 
                     teaching, to the design and development of software systems 
 
                     have 
 
                     significant opportunities both to do good and to cause harm 
 
                     AND TO 
 
                     INFLUENCE AND ENABLE OTHERS TO DO GOOD OR CAUSE 
 
                     HARM. To assure, as much as possible, that this power will 
 
                     be used for 
 
                     good, software engineers must commit themselves to making 
 
                     the design 
 
                     and development of software a beneficial, and respected profession. 
 
                     In 
 
                     accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall 
 
                     adhere to 
 
                     the following code of ethics. </p>
 
                   <p>The code contains eight keyword principles related to the 
 
                     behavior of and decisions made by professional software engineers, 
 
                     be they practitioners, educators, managers and supervisors, 
 
                     or policy makers, as well as trainees and students of the 
 
                     profession. The Principles identify the various relationships 
 
                     in which individuals, groups, and organizations participate 
 
                     and the primary obligations within these relationships. </p>
 
                   <p>Each principle of this code addresses three levels of ethical 
 
                     obligation owed by professional software engineers in each 
 
                     of these relationships. The first level identified is a set 
 
                     of ethical values which they share with all other human beings 
 
                     by virtue of their humanity. The second level obliges professionals 
 
                     to a higher order of care for those WHO MAY BE Affected by 
 
                     their work. The third and deeper level comprises several obligations 
 
                     which derive directly from elements unique to the professional 
 
                     practice of software engineering. The clauses of each principle 
 
                     are illustrations of the various levels of obligation included 
 
                     in that relationship.</p>
 
                   <p>The clauses under each Principle consist of three different 
 
                     types of statement corresponding to each level. Level One: 
 
                     Aspire (to be human); Statements of aspiration provide vision 
 
                     and objectives, are intended to direct professional behavior. 
 
                     These directives require significant ethical judgement. Level 
 
                     Two: Expect (to be professional); Statements of expectation 
 
                     express the obligations of all professionals and professional 
 
                     attitudes.</p>
 
                   <p> Again they do not describe the specific behavior details 
 
                     but they clearly indicate professional responsibilities in 
 
                     computing. Level Three: Demand (to use good practices); Statements 
 
                     of demand assert more specific behavioral responsibilities 
 
                     within software engineering which are more closely related 
 
                     to the current state of the art. The range of statements is 
 
                     from the more general aspirational statement to specific measurable 
 
                     requirements.</p>
 
                   <p>Although all levels of professional obligation are recognized 
 
                     and because the Code contains different types of statements, 
 
                     the Code is not intended to be all inclusive nor is it intended 
 
                     that its individual parts be used in isolation to justify 
 
                     errors of omissions or commission. The list of Principles 
 
                     and Clauses is not exhaustive, and should not be read as separating 
 
                     the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct 
 
                     in all practical situations. The Code is not a simple ethical 
 
                     algorithm which generates ethical decisions. </p>
 
                   <p>In some situations standards may conflict with each other 
 
                     or with standards from other sources. These situations require 
 
                     the software engineer to use ethical judgement to act in a 
 
                     manner which is most consistent with the SPIRIT OF THE code 
 
                     of ethics, given the circumstances. </p>
 
                   <p>These ethical tensions can best be answered by thoughtful 
 
                     consideration of fundamental principles, rather than reliance 
 
                     on detailed regulations. These Principles should influence 
 
                     you to consider broadly who is affected by your work; to examine 
 
                     if YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES are treating other human beings 
 
                     with due respect; to speculate on how the public would view 
 
                     your decision IF THEY WERE REASONABLY WELL INFORMED; to analyze 
 
                     how the least empowered will be affected by your decision; 
 
                     and to consider if your acts would be considered worthy of 
 
                     the ideal PROFESSIONAL WORKING AS A software engineer. </p>
 
                   <p>Since this code represents a consensus of those engaged in 
 
                     the profession one should TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT IS likely 
 
                     to be judged as the most ethical way to act in the circumstances 
 
                     by informed, respected, and experienced peers in possession 
 
                     of all the facts AND ONLY DEPART FROM SUCH A COURSE FOR PROFOUND 
 
                     REASONS, BACKED WITH CAREFUL JUDGEMENT. </p>
 
                   <p>The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering 
 
                     requires a code that is adaptable and relevant to new situations 
 
                     as they occur. But even in this generality, the code provides 
 
                     support for the software engineer who needs to take positive 
 
                     action by documenting the ethical stance of the profession; 
 
                     an ethical foundation to which individuals within teams and 
 
                     the team as a whole can appeal. </p>
 
                   <p>The code also helps to define those things which are ethically 
 
                     improper to request of an software engineer. The code has 
 
                     an educational function, stating what is required of anyone 
 
                     wishing to join or continue in the software engineering community. 
 
                     Because it expresses the consensus of the profession on ethical 
 
                     issues it can be used as a guide to decision making and as 
 
                     means to educate both the public and aspiring professionals 
 
                     about the professional obligation of ALL software engineers</p>
