       <p>Certify, License or Register Software Professionals<br>
   by Larry Bernstein, President NSC<br>
   TO: Friends of the National Software Council<br>
   RE: NSC Forum on Licensing of Software Professionals<br>
   Here are notes from the National Software Council Forum on the Licensing of Software
   Professionals and my proposal for action.
         
     <p>The NSC sponsored a Forum to debate the need to provide a certification
         and licensing program for software professionals, specifically, software
         engineers. This issue is very hot within university and government circles.
         The meeting, held in St. Louis on 21 and 22 June 1996, involved leading
         persons from academia, industry, and government who lead the debate on
         certification.</p>
       <p>The ACM was represented by Steward Zweben, President of the ACM and
         the IEEE by Elliot Chikofsky, Chair of the Technical Activity Group on
         Software Engineering of the IEEE Computer Society.</p>
       <p>Mary Shaw of Carnegie Mellon University spoke on &quot;Should US Software
         Engineers be licensed&quot; She argued against licensing. She said that
         software engineering is immature compared with civil or chemical engineering.
         For software engineering to mature requires a consolidation and validation
         of its body of knowledge. She asked if software engineering was closer
         to mathematics than engineering She suggested that the software engineering
         knowledge base is not stable enough to support licensing and certification.
         Before we embark on any certification or licensing program she demands
         that we develop and adopt a robust software engineering body of knowledge..
         Industry, government, professional societies and universities must accept
         a single software engineering taxonomy, which only then would be the
         basis for a certification or licensing program. Shaw does not believe
         that today's body of knowledge is sufficient. Shaw also discussed the
         need for standards. She called for a codification of our body of software
         engineering knowledge.</p>
       <p>Norm Gibbs of Guilford College, North Carolina, (and recently headed
         the software education program of the SEI) spoke about the software engineering
         curricula in the United States. He proposed that the medical profession's
         certification and licensing program become the model software engineering.
         Gibb's insisted that we must leverage on the investment that industry
         is making in training programs. He implored us to agree on a practice.
         Gibbs contrasted current engineering certification and licensing programs.
         He concluded that the while certification assures a level of education,
         licensing is aimed at accountability</p>
       <p>Most of the debate was in favor of certification and licensing with
         the lack a sufficient body of knowledge being the stumbling block. Don
         Gotterbarn of the Tennessee State University argued that such a body
         of knowledge existed and disagreed with Shaw. Gotterbarn went on to give
         his views on the lack of accepted ethics of software engineering practice.
         He warned that if the software engineering community does not step certify
         and license its professionals, the professional engineering community
         will. Today's state licensing examinations have little relevance to software
         engineering.</p>
       <p>Nancy Mead of the Software Engineering Institute discussed their initiatives
         to improve software engineering education.</p>
       <p>Stewart Zweben called for a more compelling reason for certification
         and licensing than just the good of the profession. Professional societies
         must make the case for how certification and licensing will benefit society.</p>
       <p>Pat Douglas, of IBM, has been working on a survey of software engineering.
         This effort under the guidance of the joint IEEE/ACM steering committee
         needs support and leadership.</p>
       <p>Michael Berens, representing the ASQC, argued for certification and
         urged the NSC to make it happen.</p>
       <p>Perhaps the most revealing dialogue took place in the summary session.
         These are the findings from the Forum: 1. There is a lack of high level
         industry participation or interest. 2. The leaders of the profession
         are silent. 3. Why should the NSC become involved Can it be a forcing
         function to set a national agenda and help the various factions coalesce
         4. Gibbs endorsed the concept of certification (versus licensing). More
         work is needed on the mechanics of such a program. 5. There is a consensus
         for certification within specialties 6. The goal is to have a program
         in place by October 1997.. 7. The NSC should be active in the IEEE/ACM
         steering committee activity, perhaps even chairing the committee. 8..
         The NSC should participate in IEEE/ACM/STC conferences on this subject.</p>
       <p>There is a consensus for a certification program in software engineering,
         and that the NSC should provide leadership in bringing such a program
         to realization.<br>
   Larry Bernstein's Proposal for Registration: The National Software Council
   registers systems as &quot;Safety Critical&quot; ones. These are systems that
   can effect human health and welfare, privacy, financial controls, national
   security or trade secrets. Any customer or supplier can register their request
   for a system, their working system or their developing system as &quot;Safety
   Critical&quot; with the NSC if and only if</p>
       <p>1. They are a member of the NSC. 2. There is a named NSC registered
         software architect responsible for all technical decisions. 3. There
         is a named NSC registered software project manager responsible for the
         tradeoffs between features/functions, schedule, costs, throughput, response
         time and availability. This person may be the same as the software architect.
         4. They advocate and practice code of software engineering ethics for
         safe systems:</p>
       <p>a. Systems will not dehumanize b. Systems will be tested. c. Software
         Engineers will be current with technology and practices. d. Risks and
         confidence levels for successful operation will be identified. e. Efforts
         used to make the system safe will be explicitly identified.</p>
       <p>Safe systems are those that have been verified to perform their functions
         properly and can sense when they are about to fail and recover or shut
         down in an orderly way.</p>
       <p>To be a registered safetycritical software architect or project manager
         one must:</p>
       <p>a. Be endorsed in writing by two others registered safetycritical software
         architects or project managers. b. Be a member in good standing of the
         NSC. c. Be an advocate and practitioner of a code of ethics d. Be current
         in the field e. Provide a written rationale for decisions f. Follow a
         defined process<br>
   When these conditions are met the system, architect or project manager may
   use a 'NSC Safety Assured' seal.</p>
