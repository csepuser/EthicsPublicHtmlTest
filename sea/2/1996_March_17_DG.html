       <p align="justify">PREAMBLE v 2.0</p>
       <p align="justify">Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce,
         industry, government, medicine, education, entertainment, social affairs,
         and ordinary life. Those who contribute, by direct participation or by
         teaching, to the design and development of software systems have significant
         opportunities both to do good and to cause harm. To assure, as much as
         possible, that this power will be used for good, software engineers must
         commit themselves to making the design and development of software a
         beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance with that commitment,
         software engineers shall adhere to the following code of ethics. </p>
       <p align="justify">The code contains eight keyword principles related to
         the behavior of and decisions made by professional software engineers,
         be they practitioners, educators, managers and supervisors, or policy
         makers, as well as trainees and students of the profession. The Principles
         identify the various relationships in which individuals, groups, and
         organizations participate and the primary obligations within these relationships.
         . Each principle of this code addresses three levels of ethical obligation
         owed by professional software engineers in each of these relationships.
         The first level identified is a set of ethical values which they share
         with all other human beings by virtue of their humanity. The second level
         obliges professionals to a higher order of care for those effected by
         their work. The third and deeper level comprises several of those obligations
         which derive directly from elements unique to the professional practice
         of software engineering. The clauses of each principle are illustrations
         of the various levels of obligation included in that relationship.</p>
       <p align="justify">The clauses under each Principle consist of three different
         types of statement corresponding to each level. Level One: Aspire (to
         be human); Statements of aspiration provide vision and objectives, are
         intended to direct professional behavior. These directives require significant
         ethical judgement. Level Two: Expect (to be professional);Statements
         of expectation express the obligations of all professionals and professional
         attitudes. Again they do not describe the specific behavior details but
         they clearly indicate professional responsibilities in computing. Level
         Three: Demand (to use good practices); Statements of demand assert more
         specific behavioral responsibilities within software engineering which
         are more closely related to the current state of the art. The range of
         statements is from the more general aspirational statement to specific
         measurable requirements.</p>
       <p align="justify">Although all levels of professional obligation are recognized
         and because the Code contains different types of statements, the Code
         is not intended to be all inclusive nor is it intended that its individual
         parts be used in isolation to justify errors of omissions or commission.
         The list of Principles and Clauses is not exhaustive, and should not
         be read as separating the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional
         conduct in all practical situations. The Code is not a simple ethical
         algorithm which generates ethical decisions. In some situations standards
         may conflict with each other or with standards from other sources. These
         situations require the software engineer to use ethical judgement to
         act in a manner which is most consistent with the code of ethics, given
         the circumstances. </p>
       <p align="justify">These ethical tensions can best be answered by thoughtful
         consideration of fundamental principles, rather than reliance on detailed
         regulations. These Principles should influence you to consider broadly
         who is affected by your work; to examine if we are treating other human
         beings with due respect; to speculate on how the public would view your
         decision; to analyze how the least empowered will be affected by your
         decision; and to consider if your acts would be considered worth of the
         ideal software engineer. Since this code represents a consensus of those
         engaged in the profession one should determine to act in a manner likely
         to be judged as the most ethical way to act in the circumstances by informed,
         respected, and experienced peers in possession of all the facts. </p>
       <p align="justify">The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering
         requires a code that is adaptable and relevant to new situations as they
         occur. But even in this generality, the code provides support for the
         software engineer who needs to take positive action by documenting the
         ethical stance of the profession; an ethical foundation to which individuals
         within teams and the team as a whole can appeal. The code also helps
         to define those things which are ethically improper to request of an
         software engineer. The code has an educational function, by stating what
         is required of anyone wishing to join or continue in the software engineering
         community. Because it expresses the consensus of the profession on ethical
         issues it can be used as a guide to decision making and as means to educate
         both the public and aspiring professionals about the professional obligation
         of software engineers</p>
