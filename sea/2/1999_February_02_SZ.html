       <p>1. Introductions and Logistics</p>
       <p>This was the first meeting of the Software Engineering Coordinating
         Committee (SWECC), a joint activity of the ACM and the IEEE Computer
         Society (CS). The meeting began with self-introductions of all present:</p>
       <p>-- Leonard Tripp (Chair, CS)<br>
         -- Dennis Frailey (Co?chair, ACM)<br>
         -- Mark Ardis (SIGSOFT)<br>
         -- Doris Carver (CS Education)<br>
         -- Karl Reed (CS)<br>
         -- Laurie Werth (proxy for Linda Northrop, ACM Education)</p>
       <p>We agreed that important decisions of SWECC would be captured as &quot;Resolutions&quot;.
         Each resolution would be prepared in written form by a sponsor. All resolutions
         passed by SWECC would be published in the minutes. Creation and completion
         of projects will be done by resolution. Other procedures for the committee
         will unfold over time.</p>
       <p>Mark Ardis agreed to be the recorder for this meeting. Future recorders
         will be chosen by self?nomination or rotation.</p>
       <p>Dennis Frailey proposed that we discuss inter?project coordination during
         the &quot;New Business&quot; portion of the agenda. Other new business
         items to be discussed were: cooperation with a Dagstuhl Workshop, and
         conduct of workshops as publicity for SWECC.</p>
       <p>We agreed to the agenda as planned.</p>
       <p>2. Overview and History of SWECC Project<br>
         Leonard Tripp presented an overview of SWECC. (See slides in attachment &quot;swecc
         oveview.pdf'.) The charter of the committee is to &quot;foster and maintain
         software engineering as a professional computing</p>
       <p><br>
         discipline&quot;. It was created as a joint effort of ACM and IEEE CS.</p>
       <p>Although some of the stimulus for the creation of SWECC was the recent
         action of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers to license software
         engineers, both technical societies consider SWECC to be an international
         effort.</p>
       <p>The Executive Committee (EC) of SWECC consists of the attendees of this
         meeting (except that Laurie Werth was attending as a proxy for Linda
         Northrop). The EC is authorized to propose projects, such as the Software
         Engineering Body Of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Project. However, the sponsoring
         technical societies must approve all projects.</p>
       <p>Key events of SWECC are an annual activity report, an annual budget
         projection, and an annual financial report. The EC will meet at least
         once per year, with two meetings currently scheduled for 1999. The next
         meeting will be held in Montreal, Canada, on July 13, 1999.</p>
       <p>A context diagram (slide 7 in attachment &quot;swecc oveview.pdf') relates
         several proposed projects of SWECC:</p>
       <p>-- Guide to SWEBOK<br>
         -- SWE Model Curriculum<br>
         -- SWE Test Specification<br>
         -- SWE Code of Ethics</p>
       <p>The SWE Test Specification project will be a primary input to a software
         engineering professional licensing examination. State agencies, such
         as the Texas Board of Professional Engineers, conduct licensing. They
         rely on technical societies to prepare test specifications for the body
         of knowledge that is expected of examinees. In addition, they often require
         that applicants receive a degree in their discipline from an accredited
         program. Such programs will often follow a model curriculum posed by
         the technical societies.</p>
       <p>Licensing varies from state to state, but most states use a similar
         process. In order to be licensed each applicant must:</p>
       <p>-- obtain an appropriate bachelor's degree from an ABET accredited engineering
         program</p>
       <p>-- pass a Fundamentals of Engineering exam, consisting of a morning
         exam on general engineering topics, and an afternoon exam on a specialty
         area (such as software engineering)</p>
       <p>-- spend at least four years practicing their discipline under the supervision
         of a licensed engineer</p>
       <p><br>
         -- apply for a license, including submission of references</p>
       <p>-- pass a specialty area exam, such as safety?critical applications.</p>
       <p>In practice, most states use an exam prepared by the National Council
         of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES, http://ncees.orgL).
         These exams are prepared from a set of Performance Norms that are supplied
         by the appropriate technical societies. The American Society for Engineering
         Education (ASEE, http://www.asee.orql) plays an important role in influencing
         NCEES to create exams.</p>
       <p>We decided that coordinating and cooperating with organizations like
         ASEE and NCEES was important to our effort.</p>
       <p>Leonard continued his presentation with some of the history of an earlier
         version of SWECC begun in 1993. (See slides in attachment &quot;ieeeacmfvll.pdf'.)
         Much of this history is contained in the Final Report of Joint IEEE Computer
         Society and ACM Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software
         Engineering as a Profession.</p>
       <p>One of the lessons from the earlier effort was that it required more
         work than could be expected from volunteers only. That is, some support
         for funding projects, such as the body of knowledge project, would be
         needed.</p>
       <p>The earlier project had produced a useful draft of a code of ethics,
         and it had started an effort to define an undergraduate curriculum. It
         was recommended that these efforts continue to their logical completion.
         It was also recommended that the effort continue to cooperate with the
         Texas Board of Professional Engineers.</p>
       <p>3. Relationships between SWECC and others</p>
       <p>We then proceeded to discuss the relationships between our effort and
         organizations such as ASEE, NCEES, etc. The objective was to identify
         liaisons between our activities and these other bodies. Although we started
         to identify liaisons, we did not complete this task. Leonard Tripp took
         an action item to prepare a list of liaisons by major categories for
         review by the EC.</p>
       <p>A question that arose during our discussions was the possible certification
         of specialties in software engineering. For example,</p>
       <p><br>
         in medicine one first obtains a license to practice medicine, but additional
           certifications to practice specialties (e.g., internal medicine, general
           surgery, orthopedics) can be granted by the medical board. Might safety?critical
           software be such a specialty deserving certification? Dennis Frailey
           took an action item to prepare a white paper on this subject for review.<br>
         4. Plans<br>
         Our next topic was future plans for SWECC. Much of this discussion focussed
         on the difficulties of preparing a description of a body of knowledge,
         the mechanics of preparing licensing exams from such a description, and
         the relationship of a model curriculum to these efforts.<br>
         The SWEBOK project is looking for funding from about ten organizations
         that will serve as an Industry Advisory Board. Two of these organizations
         are the ACM and the IEEE CS. The other participants would be industrial
         sponsors who found value in the project. This will provide a check on
         the relevance of the work. Almost all of the organizations have been
         identified and have promised to support the effort.<br>
         Once the body of knowledge is identified, a set of performance norms
         (sample questions) is prepared by volunteers. Such a project will be
         proposed for SWECC when it is appropriate. Although the volunteers are
         not paid, some modest living and travel expenses would be reimbursed.
         The future project will have to identify a funding source for these expenses.</p>
       <p>In addition to SWEBOK, a project that SWECC wanted to start soon was
         the development of a model curriculum for software engineering. We spent
         some time discussing the objectives of such a project, and its relationships
         to other activities.</p>
       <p>Dennis Frailey proposed two resolutions concerning the relationships
         between a model curriculum project and the SWEBOK project. (See Resolution
         1 &quot;Division of Responsibility between Body of Knowledge project
         and Education project&quot; and Resolution 2 &quot;Cooperative activity
         between SWEBOK and Education Projects&quot; at the end of these minutes.)
         Both resolutions were passed by the EC. A white paper describing the
         motivation for these resolutions is included as an attachment (&quot;white.
         doc&quot;).<br>
         Karl Reed proposed a resolution to the effect that any such model<br>
         5of11<br>
         7/26/2005 5:07 PM</p>
       <p><br>
         curriculum contain the core content of software engineering. (See Resolution
           3 &quot;Undergraduate Curriculum Model&quot;, at the end of these minutes.)
           This resolution was passed by the EC.</p>
       <p>Finally, we discussed a document release process. It was agreed that
         the Chair and Co?chair of the EC would issue reports, minutes and general
         information about SWECC. Project deliverables, such as final reports,
         would be issued by the EC.</p>
       <p>5. Overview of Software Engineering Standards</p>
       <p>Leonard Tripp gave an overview of software engineering standards activity
         as introductory material for the SWEBOK discussion. (See attachment &quot;sesc.pdf'.)
         Much of the SWEBOK effort has followed the same process as used by international
         standards organizations.</p>
       <p>6. Report on SWEBOK Project</p>
       <p>Leonard Tripp gave a report on the SWEBOK project. (See attachments &quot;swebokprl.pdf'
         and &quot;sweccjan2999.pdf'.) This project was started in December 1997
         as a joint effort of the IEEE CS and the University of Quebec at Montreal.
         As mentioned earlier, the SWEBOK will be used by the model curriculum
         project and by the project that identifies performance norms for licensing.
         It is also intended to be a resource of general use to many others, such
         as practicing software engineers, students, and educators.</p>
       <p>The result of the first phase was a strawman version of a Guide to Software
         Engineering Body of Knowledge. An Industry Advisory Board reviewed this
         document and provided suggestions for the next phase of the project.
         One of the main requests was to collapse a large set of Knowledge Areas
         (KAs) down to a more reasonable number. The resulting list has ten items:</p>
       <p>-- Software Requirements Analysis<br>
         -- Software Design<br>
         -- Software Construction<br>
         -- Software Testing<br>
         -- Software Maintenance<br>
         -- Software Configuration Management<br>
         -- Software Quality Analysis<br>
         -- Software Engineering Management<br>
         -- Software Engineering Infrastructure</p>
       <p><br>
         -- Software Engineering Process</p>
       <p>Karl Reed raised the issue of the role of the history of software engineering
         in the proposed KAs. Mark Ardis took an action item to raise this issue
         to SWEBOK.</p>
       <p>In the next phase a KA specialist will be selected to draft each KA
         description (Version 0.1). Each description will include an overview
         of the area, a set of performance norms, and a list of references. Each
         description is expected to be about twenty pages long.</p>
       <p>A panel of experts will review the draft descriptions and make suggestions
         for the next version (Version 0.5). Teams with specific focus (e.g.,
         industrial practice, education, standards) will review that version.
         Each focus team will have a review captain who will be responsible for
         coordinating reviews across all KAs. The result of editing to accommodate
         those reviews will be Version 0.7. Finally, a large body of reviewers
         will participate in the final review phase. This group will be selected
         along demographic lines suggested by the members of the Industry Advisory
         Board. The last version of the KAs produced after this review will be
         Version 0.9.</p>
       <p>The overall schedule for SWEBOK is:</p>
       <p>KA 0.1 -- 1st Quarter 1999</p>
       <p>KA 0.5 -- 2nd Quarter 1999</p>
       <p>KA 0.7 -- 3rd Quarter 1999</p>
       <p>KA 0.9 -- 4th Quarter 1999</p>
       <p>As mentioned earlier, funding for this project is provided by the Industry
         Advisor Board. With ten equal shares of $30,000 each, the project appears
         to be adequately funded.</p>
       <p>One of the concerns of EC members was the limited opportunity for participation
         by knowledgeable members of the technical societies. It was agreed that
         the panel of experts should include nominees from the technical societies.
         Karl Reed and Mark Ardis took an action item to draft a list of experts
         for the EC. In addition, the special review teams will include technical
         reviewers captained by representatives of the technical societies.</p>
       <p>Since review plays an important role in the SWEBOK process, Karl Reed
         took an action item to find suitable means of motivating reviewers to
         participate. One mechanism for inviting reviewers will be to</p>
       <p><br>
         publicize a call in ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes. Mark Ardis
           took an action item to place a call in a future issue.</p>
       <p>Another concern was the interaction of the education community with
         the SWEBOK effort. The resolutions brought forward by Dennis Frailey
         (see resolutions 1 and 2) address many of these concerns, but there may
         be other opportunities to cooperate. The educational representatives,
         Doris Carver and Laurie Werth (acting for Linda Northrop), took an action
         item to invite their respective organizations to participate in SWEBOK.</p>
       <p>The EC endorsed SWEBOK as a SWECC project.</p>
       <p>7. Responsibility Areas</p>
       <p>We reviewed the main projects and other significant activities of SWECC
         to assign each activity to at least one member of the EC. The following
         assignments were identified:</p>
       <p>SWEBOK -- Leonard Tripp</p>
       <p>Education -- Dennis Frailey</p>
       <p>Publicity -- Karl Reed and Linda Northrop</p>
       <p>Liaison with Standards -- Leonard Tripp</p>
       <p>Liaison with National Bodies -- Leonard Tripp</p>
       <p>We expect other responsibilities to be identified after reviewing a
         more complete liaison list.</p>
       <p>8. Future Plans</p>
       <p>The last items we discussed were the creation of a web page for SWECC,
         and future meetings.</p>
       <p>Both technical societies have begun planning for the web page. A target
         date of February 15 has been set for initial deployment. The first version
         will have an introduction, a document register, and a brief description
         of related activities. Later versions will include a history of activity
         and a possible chat room.</p>
       <p><br>
         A related issue of visibility is the production of letterhead and business
           cards for SWECC. We noted an action item for this but failed to assign
           it.</p>
       <p>We agreed to meet by teleconference during the week of April 12, 1999,
         probably on the 13th or 14th. We also acknowledged that the next face?to?face
         meeting would be in Montreal on July 13, 1999.</p>
       <p>9. Resolutions Passed by SWECC EC</p>
       <p><br>
         Resolution 1: Division of Responsibility between Body of Knowledge project
           and Education project.</p>
       <p>Sponsor: Dennis J. Frailey</p>
       <p>The body of knowledge project and the education project shall divide
         responsibilities for identifying the body of knowledge as follows:</p>
       <p>-- The BOK Project shall be responsible for the identifying the knowledge
         areas that are unique to software engineers and, within each knowledge
         area, identifying and providing reference material to definitive sources
         on the topics that are essential to a software engineer.</p>
       <p>-- The BOK Project shall be responsible for identifying other disciplines
         that contain knowledge areas that are important for a software engineer.</p>
       <p>-- The BOK Project and the Education project shall be jointly responsible
         for identifying those knowledge areas within other disciplines (computer
         science, computer engineering, math, science, etc.) that are necessary
         for a software engineer.</p>
       <p>-- The Education Project shall be responsible for identifying and providing
         authoritative references for the topics within each knowledge area from &quot;other&quot; disciplines
         that are necessary for software engineers.</p>
       <p>Resolution 2: Cooperative activity between SWEBOK and Education Projects<br>
         Sponsor: Dennis J. Frailey<br>
         Each project shall have at least one annual review of its progress, to
         which the other project(s) and SWECC shall be invited to send representatives.
         Furthermore, for those responsibilities that are</p>
       <p><br>
         joint, the projects shall plan and budget for appropriate joint activities
           and shall keep SWECC and the other projects informed of these.</p>
       <p>Resolution 3: Undergraduate Curriculum Model</p>
       <p>Sponsor: Karl Reed</p>
       <p>The undergraduate curriculum model should contain the core content of
         the software engineering field. At a minimum, a program that implements
         the model should meet accreditation standards, and a student who graduates
         from the program should be prepared to pass a fundamentals of software
         engineering licensing exam.</p>
