                   <p align="justify">Dear Mr. Gotterbarn:</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">As a member of the ACM, I read your committee's 
 
                     proposed code of ethics in the 11/97 issue of &quot;CACM&quot; 
 
                     with interest. Since my expertise is software and hardware 
 
                     QA and test, I applaud the inclusion of language that stresses 
 
                     the importance of properly testing software systems prior 
 
                     to release. I have worked on too many projects where test 
 
                     is shortchanged during the development cycle, only to have 
 
                     predictions of field failures come all too true after release. 
 
                     Heightening awareness of the importance of formal, structured 
 
                     test methodologies, along with other QA techniques such as 
 
                     code reviews and inspections, formal requirements definitions, 
 
                     and release management, is a good idea.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The only portion of your proposal with which 
 
                     I have any real trouble is subsection 2.05. I understand the 
 
                     temptation to include politically correct verbiage, but I 
 
                     object to the clause, especially the phrase &quot;respect 
 
                     diversity&quot;. I'm sure Hillary Clinton would applaud this 
 
                     portion, but I find it unacceptable, for the following reasons:</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">1. It's vague. As an example, some computer 
 
                     programs help insurance companies set prices for policies, 
 
                     sometimes based on where people live. This results in people 
 
                     living in high?crime areas paying higher rates or being denied 
 
                     policies. Statistically, these people are disproportionately 
 
                     minorities. If I work with a client on a project to develop 
 
                     such software, have I violated this subsection? Surely some 
 
                     people who have spoken out against this so?called &quot;red?lining&quot; 
 
                     would say I have. However, if insurance companies have the 
 
                     legal right??perhaps even a fiduciary responsibility to their 
 
                     shareholders??to sell policies based on established risk factors, 
 
                     isn't it in society's interest that the best possible software 
 
                     engineers work on such systems?</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">2. It's contradictory. I am currently working 
 
                     with a client whose product provides dating?related services 
 
                     over the phone, both for purposes of long?term relationships 
 
                     and simple sexual gratification, some of it homosexual. Being 
 
                     a libertarian, this does not concern me. However, if I were 
 
                     an employee at a contract software firm, and my religious 
 
                     faith condemned premarital and homosexual sex, would I fail 
 
                     to &quot;respect diversity&quot; by refusing to work on such 
 
                     a project, or would my employer fail to &quot;respect diversity&quot; 
 
                     by insisting that I do such work or be fired? </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">3. It's pointless. Any software engineer 
 
                     who works on games such as those &quot;Nazi death camp&quot; 
 
                     ones so widely reported not too long ago could hardly be expected 
 
                     to trouble his head much with a code of ethics, yes? In other 
 
                     words, the hardcore &quot;diversity disrespectors&quot; won't 
 
                     care about this clause. Those of us who will care, already 
 
                     do care.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">4. It's dangerous. Recent history abounds 
 
                     with instances of companies and individuals who were branded 
 
                     by the spokesfolks of the politically correct as people who 
 
                     failed to &quot;respect diversity&quot;??the usual words were 
 
                     &quot;bigots&quot;, &quot;racists&quot;, &quot;homophobes&quot;, 
 
                     etc. In some cases, facts emerged to debunk the charges, but 
 
                     by then the demogogues coordinating the public tarring and 
 
                     feathering of the allegedly insensitive entity had built up 
 
                     such a head of steam that not even the truth could stop the 
 
                     stampede. Just by being a white male, my odds of being the 
 
                     guest of dishonor in such an incident are unfairly high. I 
 
                     can ill?afford a code of ethics that exposes me to further 
 
                     ignominy at the hands of some self?appointed protector of 
 
                     some self?designated oppressed element of society. Careers 
 
                     have been ruined this way, in some cases most unfairly.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">5. It's unnecessary. I believe other portions 
 
                     of the code adequately address participating in or abetting 
 
                     an illegal act of discrimination or a hate crime. Issues like 
 
                     discrimination, racism, lifestyle?choice rights, and immigration 
 
                     are highly?charged social questions that are both morally 
 
                     complex and rapidly evolving. In my opinion, guidance on these 
 
                     matters is beyond the scope of a professional code of ethics, 
 
                     and surely beyond the scope of two short sentences.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In Stalinist Russia, few examples so capture 
 
                     the fallacy and stupidity of socialism as &quot;Socialist 
 
                     Science&quot;. Scientists bent their knees to the Communist 
 
                     Party and its tyrants, pursuing all sorts of ridiculous theories 
 
                     because they met with the approval of the Soviet hierarchy, 
 
                     turning their backs on the truth. I don't want to suggest 
 
                     that this subsection is on the scale of that grotesquery, 
 
                     but I do want to point out a parallel: All science must be 
 
                     ethically and morally informed, but it must not take sides 
 
                     in political matters. Of course, I grant anyone the right 
 
                     to view respecting diversity, however one defines it, as a 
 
                     pillar of one's personal ethics; however, I ask that this 
 
                     code not make it a mandatory part of the ethical values of 
 
                     every software engineer.</p>
