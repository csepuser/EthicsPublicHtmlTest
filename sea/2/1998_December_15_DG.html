  ************************************************</p>
                   <p>1. INTRODUCTION </p>
 
                   <p>I want to thank Don Bagert for his invitation to edit an 
 
                     issue of FASE on Software Engineering Ethics. The job of editor 
 
                     is normally fairly straight forward: Define a topic area and 
 
                     issue a call for papers in that area; Set up a standard for 
 
                     judging which papers to include; Review the all the submitted 
 
                     papers according to that standard; and as editor, write a 
 
                     brief introduction to those papers selected for inclusion. 
 
                     My task was even simpler than that since there was only one 
 
                     paper submitted-- a list of ethics resources on the Web. The 
 
                     other contributions are probably delayed because of the increased 
 
                     amount of mail at Christmas time. : - ) In addition to the 
 
                     contributed article, I have included: a short comment on Software 
 
                     Engineering Ethics as the application of values to technical 
 
                     decisions, some comments on the Software Engineering Code 
 
                     of Ethics and Professional Practice which states some of these 
 
                     values, and selections from a piece on how to teach ethics 
 
                     in a technical class. </p>
 
                   <p>2. SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ETHICS ?? - Don Gotterbarn </p>
                   <p>I think 
   
                     software engineering ethics is a very practical discipline
                     and is a necessary part of the practical education of every
                     software engineer. I base this belief on my understanding
                     of software engineering as a profession and the nature of
                     professional ethics. I think software engineering ethics
                     as
   
                     a professional ethics actually involves three different
                     levels
                     of ethics. Software professionals must follow the same minimal
                     morality as the rest of society-- don't lie, don't cheat,
                     don't steal, don't hurt others, etc.. This first level of
                     ethics consists of a set of ethical values which we share
                     with all other human beings simply by virtue of our common
                     humanity. There is a second level of ethics shared by all
                     professionals, who by virtue of their unique talents owe
                     special
   
                     care to people affected by the professional's work. There
                     is a third level of ethics which comprises those obligations
                     which derive directly from elements which are unique to
                     the
   
                     professional practice of software engineering. What does
                     this
                     distinction between levels mean? It means Professional Software
                     Engineering Ethics: </p>
                   <p>1. is like any other ethics (at Level 1) requiring fair play 
 
                     and integrity. </p>
 
                   <p>2. is like any other professional ethics in requiring a special 
 
                     commitment to the public served and affected by the profession 
 
                     (level 2)- an ethical commitment to public well being.</p>
 
                   <p> 3. is different from other ethics in that it asserts the 
 
                     more specific behavioral responsibilities within software 
 
                     engineering, which are closely related to the state of the 
 
                     art (level 3)- an ethical commitment to quality work. </p>
 
                   <p>4. is important to every software engineer and those affected 
 
                     by the work of software engineers. Software Engineering Ethics 
 
                     involves any decision made by a software engineer during the 
 
                     design, development, construction and maintenance of computing 
 
                     artifacts. Learning how to make these decisions is an essential 
 
                     part of the technical education of a software engineer. </p>
 
                   <p>3. THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL 
 
                     PRACTICE Don Gotterbarn </p>
                   <p>The ACM and the IEEE-Computer Society 
   
                     have adopted the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and
                     Professional
                     Practice(5.2). The Code's development indicates a significant
                     agreement about the way software engineers ought to behave
                     and the Code is different from other codes in that it provides
                     a variety of mechanisms to help the practitioner make ethical
                     judgements. The Code was developed by the joint IEEE-CS/ACM
                     task force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
                     Practice. The composition of the SEEPP task force is multinational
                     in both citizenship and in membership in professional computing
                     organizations. The development of the Code was an iterative
                     process. The Code evolved after extensive study of several
                     existing codes of ethics from computing societies, engineering
                     societies and other professions. All of the codes considered:
                     try to educate and inspire the members of the professional
                     group that adopts the code; inform the public about the
                     responsibilities
   
                     that are important to that profession; instruct practitioners
                     about the standards that society expects them to meet, and
                     what their peers strive for and expect of each other. After
                     considering the various goals and functions of these codes,
                     SEEPP selected various imperatives to be placed in the draft
                     software engineering code. </p>
                   <p>They also contributed new imperatives related to their knowledge 
 
                     of software engineering and from suggestions of external reviewers. 
 
                     The draft Code which was reviewed by members of several professional 
 
                     computing societies and went through several revisions.. After 
 
                     this process, the Code (version3) was printed with a turnaround 
 
                     ballot in the IEEE-CS and the ACM flagship magazines. Although 
 
                     most of the clauses in the Code received better than a 90% 
 
                     approval rating, several of the returned comments led to the 
 
                     development of version 4 of the Code. SEEPP submitted version 
 
                     4 of the Code for review by a panel of peers using the IEEE 
 
                     formal review process for establishing technical standards. 
 
                     The Code passed this review and was modified in the light 
 
                     of reviewer's comments. The final version of the Code (www-cs.etsu.edu/seeri/secode.htm) 
 
                     was approved by the ACM in November and the IEEE-CS in December. 
 
                     I found the consistently high level of agreement about the 
 
                     behavior expected of a professional software engineer very 
 
                     significant. There is general agreement about our obligations 
 
                     as software engineers, even if some software engineers are 
 
                     not able to overcome the external pressures not to follow 
 
                     these obligations. There are several positive elements to 
 
                     this Code which distinguish it from may other codes of professional 
 
                     ethics. </p>
 
                   <p>Most codes of ethics provide a finite list of principles 
 
                     which are often presented as a complete list and the reader 
 
                     presumes that only things in the list should be items of ethical 
 
                     concern for the professional. In many situations these rules 
 
                     conflict and codes provides no guidance as to which principles 
 
                     should have higher priority. This ambiguity of priority leaves 
 
                     the ethical decision maker confused. The Software Engineering 
 
                     Code address both of these limitations of other codes. The 
 
                     Software Engineering Code explicitly rejects the concept of 
 
                     completeness. &quot;It is not intended that the individual 
 
                     parts of the Code be used in isolation to justify errors of 
 
                     omission or commission. The list of Principles and Clauses 
 
                     is not exhaustive. The Clauses should not be read as separating 
 
                     the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct 
 
                     in all practical situations. The Code is not a simple ethical 
 
                     algorithm which generates ethical decisions. .&quot; The problem 
 
                     with an incomplete Code is that it leaves us without guidance 
 
                     in new situations. To meet this potential difficulty the Software 
 
                     Engineering Code provides general guidance for ethical decision 
 
                     making, especially in those areas not explicitly mentioned 
 
                     in the Code.</p>
 
                   <p> &quot;Ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful 
 
                     consideration of fundamental principles, rather than blind 
 
                     reliance on detailed regulations. These Principles should 
 
                     influence software engineers to consider broadly who is affected 
 
                     by their work; to examine if they and their colleagues are 
 
                     treating other human beings with due respect; to consider 
 
                     how the public, if reasonably well informed, would view their 
 
                     decisions; to analyze how the least empowered will be affected 
 
                     by their decisions; and to consider whether their acts would 
 
                     be judged worthy of the ideal professiona l working as a software 
 
                     engineer. In all these judgments concern for the health, safety 
 
                     and welfare of the public is primary; that is, the &quot;Public 
 
                     Interest&quot; is central to this Code.&quot; The first principle 
 
                     asks the developer to consider all the stakeholders, not just 
 
                     their employer or client. The second principle-- due respect--requires 
 
                     a protection of human values. </p>
 
                   <p>This section also addresses the question of equal priority 
 
                     of all of the rules by stating that in all decisions the public 
 
                     interest is the primary concern. To reinforce the clear priority 
 
                     of public concern, in several places the code asserts the 
 
                     priority of concern for the public over loyalty to employer 
 
                     or profession. It is a professional obligation to take positive 
 
                     action to address violations of the Code. The Code addresses 
 
                     both the responsibilities of the practicing professional and 
 
                     of the profession. It is a positive step because it is not 
 
                     designed to be self-serving to the profession. It requires 
 
                     software engineering professionals to be ethically responsible 
 
                     to all of those who are effected by their products. </p>
 
                   <p>4. The paper below presents an approach to teaching ethics 
 
                     as an integral part computing classes. The methods presented 
 
                     here are easily adapted to software engineering courses and 
 
                     are consistent with treating Software Engineering as a profession. 
 
                     Selections from a paper published in Computer and Society 
 
                     March 1997. Ethics activities in Computer Science Courses: 
 
                     Goals and Issues Don Gotterbarn &amp; Robert Riser East Tennessee 
 
                     State University In our recent paper, Ethics Activities in 
 
                     Computer Science Courses (Computers and Society September 
 
                     1996), we suggested some techniques for introducing ethical 
 
                     activities into main stream computer science classes. Ethical/professional 
 
                     issues should be seen in the context of computing professionals 
 
                     practicing their profession. It helps to dispel the perception 
 
                     that such issues are less important or neatly separable from 
 
                     computer science. Covering these issues in main stream computer 
 
                     science classes firmly establishes links between ethical/social 
 
                     issues and technical content, methods, and practices of the 
 
                     profession. In this paper we expand on the first paper in 
 
                     two ways. We discuss some of the underlying goals and objectives 
 
                     in using this integrated approach and we present some additional 
 
                     activities which help achieve these goals and objectives. 
 
                     Learning technical skills is only one part of becoming a fully 
 
                     developed professional. </p>
 
                   <p>To be a professional involves a commitment to a higher level 
 
                     of care for those who will be effected by our products. The 
 
                     application of values to technical judgements is one of the 
 
                     necessary characteristics that distinguish a professional 
 
                     from a mere technician. This concept of a professional entails 
 
                     the inclusion of particular goals for our courses if we are 
 
                     to train computing professionals. We believe those goals should 
 
                     at least include the: - establishment of a link between social/ethical 
 
                     issues and the technical content of the computer science curriculum 
 
                     by identifying and examining these issues within the context 
 
                     of existing computer science courses - provision of a means 
 
                     for analyzing ethical situations based on generally accepted 
 
                     ethical guidelines, principles and standards, and for responding 
 
                     in a professionally responsible manner; and - to provide opportunities 
 
                     to apply such analyses understanding of the responsibilities 
 
                     of computer professionals to their various constituents - 
 
                     provision of an understanding of the ways computers impact 
 
                     society and the social environments in which they are used. 
 
                     These goals are directed toward particular behavioral objectives 
 
                     for students, including; student socialization into professional 
 
                     norms, student recognition of role responsibilities, and student 
 
                     awareness of the nature of the profession, The specific skills 
 
                     we want to nurture and test include the ability to: - correctly 
 
                     identify the potential for ethical problems in a particular 
 
                     context - identify the cause of these issues and - identify 
 
                     alternative courses of action - select a technically or morally 
 
                     workable direction which can prevent the problem from materializing 
 
                     or resolve the problem when it arises. The ideal goal is to 
 
                     develop an awareness of potential problems and strategies 
 
                     for preventing the problem from materializing in the first 
 
                     place. This requires a proactive approach to ethics.</p>
 
                   <p> To achieve these goals we believe that ethics has to be 
 
                     approached in a way that emphasizes practice more than philosophical 
 
                     theory. Students need to understand and experience ethics 
 
                     as an applied discipline. It is important to avoid endless 
 
                     unstructured discussions which start with phrases like : Who 
 
                     is to say? , Everybody has a different idea about what is 
 
                     good , etc. When dealing with professional issues and professional 
 
                     ethics, there is a general sense of ethics and ethical values 
 
                     taken for granted in all professions. We can take for granted 
 
                     a non-rigorous sense of ethics. We can presume a knowledge 
 
                     of a paradigmatic morality using some first principles to 
 
                     guide actions, e.g. harm no one needlessly or obey the Golden 
 
                     Rule. A typical set of such principles might start with: a) 
 
                     Value of life (quality of life) b) Principle of goodness- 
 
                     strive to be good, do right i. promote goodness ii. cause 
 
                     no harm iii. prevent harm c) Justice and fairness based on 
 
                     merit, equality, and need d) Tell the truth &amp; be honest. 
 
                     Any claim that has been made in computer ethics can fit into 
 
                     these presuppositions. In several other areas of commerce 
 
                     these principles have been incorporated into law. The ACM, 
 
                     in their code of ethics, adopted these principles to be applied 
 
                     to the activities of computing professionals. When we apply 
 
                     these principles to professional computing some of the ethical 
 
                     issues that need to be discussed include: Professional responsibilities 
 
                     Social responsibility Quality as a moral issue Software ownership 
 
                     and intellectual property rights Privacy Confidentiality Responsibility 
 
                     and liability Professional competence Power; Autonomy, access, 
 
                     and equity Impact on society and the workplace Security and 
 
                     reliability Safety Recently such issues have been discussed 
 
                     primarily in terms of the Internet. But I think this is dangerous 
 
                     to limit the discussion of computer ethics to Internet issues. 
 
                     It is true that because the Internet is the latest and a highly 
 
                     prevalent technology, many of the ethical muddles are being 
 
                     replayed in that arena. But one of the problems with several 
 
                     approaches to computer ethics that I have seen recently is 
 
                     that the Internet is used exclusively as a source for ethical 
 
                     issues. These issues are important, but attention exclusively 
 
                     to Internet issues does not prepare our students for the type 
 
                     of issues they will face as practicing computer professionals 
 
                     building critical systems. MORE ETHICS ACTIVITIES: In the 
 
                     previous paper, we gave some sample activities that could 
 
                     be used in CS1 courses and in project oriented courses. The 
 
                     activities used in those classes can be easily modified for 
 
                     other classes. For example the program using arrays to model 
 
                     a university parking process can be modified to model queues 
 
                     and stacks in a data structure course. Example Modification 
 
                     for Data Structures Course The parking lot example used in 
 
                     the previous paper can be easily modified to use in a data 
 
                     structures course. Like that example, the purpose of this 
 
                     example is to get the students to consider ethical issues 
 
                     related to program design. Using the correct data structures 
 
                     can have ethical significance. This programming assignment 
 
                     is distributed to students as a normal assignment. Distribute 
 
                     the ethics assignment on the day the program is turned in. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Distribute the ACM code of ethics along with the description 
 
                     of the writing assignment. When the writing assignment is 
 
                     turned in, lead a discussion on the ethical issues they found. 
 
                     As a way to get them to practice anticipating ethical issues, 
 
                     ask them how they could change the solution to avoid these 
 
                     problems. The program asks them to program an automated a 
 
                     parking system being designed for an annual local festival. 
 
                     Cars enter one of three queues which are dequeued into the 
 
                     parking area only after all the queues are full. No one is 
 
                     admitted to the queues while they are being emptied. The cars 
 
                     are dequeued into the parking lot based on a priority scheme. 
 
                     The cars are parked into one of three stacks. When the festival 
 
                     ends the stacks are popped one at a time until each is empty. 
 
                     There are several ethical issues with the design. The filling 
 
                     of the queues prevents anyone from leaving the area in an 
 
                     emergency. Preventing admission to the lanes (queues) while 
 
                     they are being dequeued causes dangerous traffic on the entrance 
 
                     highway. The priority dequeueing scheme causes traffic to 
 
                     cross several lanes increasing the likelihood of a crash. 
 
                     There is no handicapped access or parking.</p>
 
                   <p> Using a stack structure in the parking lot prevents any 
 
                     vehicle from leaving early. There can be a good discussion 
 
                     about the programmer s responsibility to explain some of these 
 
                     difficulties to the customer. If the customer insists on this 
 
                     design, what are the programmer s responsibilities to society 
 
                     at large? PROBLEM STATEMENT: (the complete example is available

                     Assignment Associated with this Program: Read the attached 
 
                     ACM Code of Ethics and Professional conduct paying particular 
 
                     attention to the examples of professional ethical concerns 
 
                     in the guidelines. Assume that the events in the programming 
 
                     assignment are real. YOU have been asked by the director of 
 
                     the festival to write this program for the parking facility 
 
                     that they are planning to build. Write a brief but thoughtful 
 
                     essay about ethical issues raised by this programming assignment. 
 
                     How would you handle the ethical problem? </p>
 
                   <p>NON-PROGRAMMING ETHICS ACTIVITIES Programming exercises are 
 
                     useful vehicles to understand and anticipate ethical issues 
 
                     involved in software development. Studies have shown that 
 
                     peer discussions are the most effective ways of achieving 
 
                     the goals cited above. Scenario Analysis Scenarios and scenario 
 
                     analysis can be used in all courses. The only difference is 
 
                     that the complexity and subject matter of the scenarios will 
 
                     vary to fit the technical content of the courses. The purpose 
 
                     of such analysis is to help the students develop analysis 
 
                     abilities with respect to ethical issue scenarios, including 
 
                     the ability to identify the stakeholders, isolate the relevant 
 
                     issues, apply appropriate guidelines (ACM Code of Ethics and 
 
                     Professional Conduct, IEEE standards for testing and software 
 
                     development), identify possible courses of action, anticipate 
 
                     potential ethical problems and recommend appropriate courses 
 
                     of action and policy changes to prevent recurrence. In most 
 
                     technical classes it is easy to provide repeated opportunities 
 
                     to apply these analysis abilities. A Typical Scenario Presentation 
 
                     1. Distribute the scenario such as one found in Deborah Johnson's 
 
                     computer ethics text about a consultant, Diane. who has a 
 
                     disagreement with her client. Give the class a few minutes 
 
                     to read it. Use the following questions to steer the class 
 
                     in analyzing the scenario. Who are the stakeholders in this 
 
                     scenario and what are their stakes? Be sure they include Diane, 
 
                     Diane's employees, toy manufacturer, employees of toy manufacturer. 
 
                     What responsibilities does Diane have to each of the stakeholders, 
 
                     including herself?</p>
 
                   <p> What are the essential issues here? What courses of action 
 
                     does Diane have? Besides the obvious extremes (Diane refuses 
 
                     to do the project; Diane gives them exactly what they ask 
 
                     for), make sure alternatives are explored. For example someone 
 
                     is likely to point out that Diane did include the less secure 
 
                     system (which she now considers inadequate) as one of the 
 
                     options presented to the client. Therefore, a reasonable course 
 
                     of action for Diane would be to provide the more secure system 
 
                     but at no (or minimal) additional cost to the client. Introduce 
 
                     general aspects of Rawls' rational contractor theory of justice. 
 
                     In this theory, situations are analyzed by imagining that 
 
                     each person is operating under a veil of ignorance that hides 
 
                     his/her exact position in the situation; i.e. one is unaware 
 
                     of his/her gender, educational level, employment status, etc. 
 
                     These &quot;ideal observers&quot; are aware of all aspects 
 
                     of the situation but are ignorant of their own role or circumstances. 
 
                     This lays the basis for an imaginary &quot;town meeting&quot; 
 
                     involving all stakeholders operating under this veil of ignorance 
 
                     (ignorant of their own special circumstances). The rules decided 
 
                     in such an environment optimize fairness. No one will makes 
 
                     rules which encourage harm or injustice since they may be 
 
                     the ones hurt. Encourage the use of this concept to examine 
 
                     ethical and/or social situations. For example, in this scenario 
 
                     you would be aware of the circumstances of Diane, her client 
 
                     (toy manufacturer), her employees and the client's employees, 
 
                     but not of which of these roles you occupy. This examination 
 
                     of the scenario from the perspective of a rational, knowledgeable 
 
                     observer (ideal observer) facilitates an agreement (a contract) 
 
                     that is beneficial, though not necessarily equal, to all. 
 
                     What should Diane do? Do you have any suggestions for Diane 
 
                     to preventing a recurrence of this type of situation? 2. We 
 
                     suggest that scenario analyses be repeated often in this and 
 
                     subsequent courses. References to some sources of scenarios 
 
                     have been attached. 3. Repeat the analysis with a slight modification 
 
                     that changes some parameters. For example, suppose Diane was 
 
                     writing a system for the United States Missile Defense System. 
 
                     This would change the stakeholders and the seriousness of 
 
                     failed security. How do these changes effect the analysis?

                   <p>A SAMPLE ASSIGNMENT (STUDENTS WORK IN GROUPS OF 2-3) Prepare 
 
                     a 2-3 page, double-spaced, analysis of the attached scenario. 
 
                     Your analysis must: -Identify the stakeholders, their respective 
 
                     stakes, and the responsibilities of the computer professional(s) 
 
                     involved with respect to each stakeholder. -Isolate the ethical 
 
                     issues involved. -Identify the principles of the ACM Code 
 
                     of Ethics and Professional Conduct that are relevant to this 
 
                     scenario? -Discuss various courses of action. Include alternatives 
 
                     in addition to the obvious extreme positions. -Recommend and 
 
                     justify a course of action. -Offer suggestions for preventing 
 
                     a recurrence of this type of situation (e.g. changes in organizational 
 
                     policies) and discuss the immediate and long-term consequences. 
 
                     -Be prepared to give a 10- minute presentation of your analysis

                   <p>VARIATIONS ON ASSIGNMENT: We found it useful to provide the 
 
                     students with a work sheet. The only danger is that some students 
 
                     will think that the worksheet is complete and that when they 
 
                     have finished with a single pass they have done all the analysis 
 
                     that is necessary. Slightly modifying the example used helps 
 
                     to reduce that tendency. </p>

                   <p>SCENARIO ANALYSIS ACTIVITIES It is important to provide some 
 
                     guidelines for analysis. They should initially focus on identifying 
 
                     the stakeholders, their respective stakes, and the essential 
 
                     issues. Once this has been done they can later develop process 
 
                     for analysis. It is good to provide them with several frameworks 
 
                     for analysis (Kallman &amp; Grillo; Collins &amp; Miller). 
 
                     We generally ask them to apply ACM Code of Ethics and Professional 
 
                     Conduct (find applicable sections; identify guidance provided 
 
                     by the code). But we want them to go beyond a check list analysis 
 
                     and ask them to do an individual analysis based on their understanding 
 
                     of the intent of the code. A code of ethics is a type of conversation 
 
                     about ethical issues between professionals and society about 
 
                     the consensus on professional obligations. Modeling this view 
 
                     we have them engage in small group analysis and do a presentation 
 
                     followed by class discussion. We also have them do role playing. 
 
                     We evaluate the analysis using the attached form.</p>

                     and long-term consequences Advice about scenario analysis: 
 
                     Research has shown that one of the most effective ways to 
 
                     introduce ethical issues into the classroom is through the 
 
                     discussion of case studies among peers in several courses. 
 
                     There are, however, several pitfalls in this methodology. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1. Sometimes the case studies are only tangentially related 
 
                     to computer ethics. Even though they contain significant detail 
 
                     they are much too broad and the ethical issues are so clouded 
 
                     that students cannot get hold of the subject. </p>
 
                   <p>2. Sometimes the case studies are so vague that there is 
 
                     no foundation on which to base an ethical judgement. Each 
 
                     listener's imagination ends up filling in their own unspoken 
 
                     details of the case on which they each make different decisions. 
 
                     The result of discussing this type of case can be so chaotic 
 
                     that the audience is led to think that they have just been 
 
                     shown the truth of ethical relativism.</p>
 
                   <p> 3. Sometimes teachers will only use catastrophic cases such 
 
                     as the Challenger disaster, because they are easy to find 
 
                     and are good attention getters. The EXCLUSIVE use of these 
 
                     cases leads students to think that computer ethics is limited 
 
                     to only these types of cases. Since students don't plan to 
 
                     program life critical systems, they tend to think that computer 
 
                     ethics is not relevant to them. The paragraphs below can form 
 
                     the basis of cases to be discussed in several classes. Many 
 
                     of the case seeds are especially appropriate for software 
 
                     development courses such as software engineering. -In determining 
 
                     for an information system to be used in an employment agency, 
 
                     the client explains that, when displaying applicants whose 
 
                     qualifications appear to match those required for a particular 
 
                     job, the names of white applicants are to be displayed ahead 
 
                     of those of non-white applicants, and names of male applicants 
 
                     are to be displayed ahead of those of female applicants. -Because 
 
                     he recognizes that maintenance of an on- line banking system 
 
                     built for an out-of-town bank will be a time-consuming ongoing 
 
                     activity, a programmer codes into the login procedure a mechanism 
 
                     to allow system- level access by means of a password that 
 
                     only he knows. - Long before system testing is complete, scheduled 
 
                     time and money for such testing has run out. The engineer 
 
                     responsible for testing is advised that the company will &quot;let 
 
                     the users do the rest of the testing.&quot; -Knowing that 
 
                     the firm developing a large piece of software for a government 
 
                     agency is unlikely to be awarded the contract to maintain 
 
                     the system after delivery, the company decides to spend less 
 
                     effort on both internal and external documentation. The money 
 
                     saved by this decision is used to pay for additional coders 
 
                     and testers, so that the system can be delivered on time. 
 
                     - A small firm lands a contract to produce software that has 
 
                     a significant database component. </p>
 
                   <p>None of the employees is familiar with current database technology, 
 
                     but the contract, the largest ever obtained by the firm, is 
 
                     viewed as a make-or-break opportunity. -While his company 
 
                     is negotiating a contract to build a software system for a 
 
                     client, the head designer learns about a new design method 
 
                     and its associated tool set. Because the proposed system is 
 
                     similar to others the company has recently built, it is clear 
 
                     that the firm's &quot;Standard&quot; methods can be applied 
 
                     reliably and economically. The company's business plan, however 
 
                     calls for it to move into the more lucrative market of more 
 
                     complex systems, for which the new design methodology may 
 
                     be required for competitiveness. The designer recommends the 
 
                     cost of the new tools be built into the contract being negotiated 
 
                     and the client be told that the tools are necessary to produce 
 
                     a system of sufficiently high quality. -In a design review, 
 
                     one of the problems identified turns out to be easy to fix. 
 
                     In exploring the problem, however, the designer discovers 
 
                     a related difficulty that can only be addressed adequately 
 
                     by a major redesign. Realizing that the special situations 
 
                     at the root of the problem will seldom arise and will certainly 
 
                     not arise in the first year or so of operation, the designer 
 
                     reports his fix to the original problem, but neither reports 
 
                     nor resolves the more serious problem. - A large computer 
 
                     firm has been hired by a fast- food chain to integrate use 
 
                     of its cash registers into its accounting system. As the client 
 
                     explains his requirements, it becomes clear that his needs 
 
                     can be served more than adequately be an off- the-shelf package 
 
                     sold by a competing software firm. -In a library automation 
 
                     system, the client has asked that a log be kept of materials 
 
                     checked out, so that data on patron needs can be used to make 
 
                     more informed decisions about future book purchases. The simplest 
 
                     way to construct such a log is to copy the full circulation 
 
                     record- including patron name-into a log file at the time 
 
                     the circulation record is generated. Software to analyze this 
 
                     file is to be written at a later time, when funds are available 
 
                     to implement this function. These techniques illustrate ways 
 
                     in which ethical issues can be incorporated into main stream 
 
                     computer science courses and help us teach professionals rather 
 
                     than merely train technicians.</p>

                   <p>Abstract</p>
                   <p>The education of software engineers has been a matter of
                     substantial debate and discussion in the UK for some time.
                     The purpose of this paper is to consider certain aspects
                     of this, but it concludes with the view that a re-assessment
                     of teaching software engineering is now needed.</p>
                   <p>November, 1998 </p>
                   <p>1. General Background</p>
                   <p> The history of education in software engineering is related
                     in some
                     sense to the history of software engineering itself. The
                     latter
                     dates back to original Software Engineering conference organised
                     by
                     the NATO Science Committee and held in Garmisch in 1968.
                     The use of
                     the phrase 'software engineering' was seen to be deliberately
                     provocative, highlighting the need to pull together concepts
                     from engineering as they apply to the development of software
                     systems.</p>
                   <p>The emergency of degree courses in the UK, specifically
                     in Software Engineering, is somewhat uncertain. Certainly
                     the Government's Alvey initiative in the mid-eighties highlighted
                     the need for increased<br>
                     attention to software engineering. The ACARD Report of 1986
                     (see [ACARD,1986]) also served to raise its profile and
                     a number of courses both at postgraduate level and at undergraduate
                     level were launched. (Almost as an aside it is worth mentioning
                     that the ACARD Report recommended the creation of a UK Software
                     Engineering Institute, an idea that was never developed
                     in the U.K.)</p>
                   <p>2. Software Engineering Degree</p>
                   <p> There was a tendency for the polytechnic sector in the
                     UK to lead the initiative that resulted in degrees in software
                     engineering, not the university sector of the day. The polytechnics
                     tended to have
                     a mission which involved high quality teaching usually with
                     a strong
                     vocational flavour. To attract students (and for advertising
                     purposes) they tended to offer a modular provision which
                     allowed
                     them to efficiently and effectively run a number of degree
                     programmes.
                     Software engineering tended to emerge as a fairly popular
                     choice.</p>
                   <p> The traditional university sector tended to hesitate about
                     offering it as a degree at that stage (though the view has
                     now
                     changed). The arguments took the following form: if software
                       engineering is to be taught properly then students need
                       to understand
                     the machines which host the software; thus software engineers
                     need
                     to understand computer architecture, machine code, communications,
                     etc., they also need systems analysis and design and they
                     must
                     have
                     a perspective on professional issues. In short what would
                     distinguish software engineering education from that of
                     the computer
                     scientist? Even today that question often proves embarrassing
                     for
                     course designers.</p>
                   <p> In the early days of Computer Science education the approach
                     to
                     curricular design was simple. Apart from programming, mathematics,
                     logic, electronics, etc., the development of courses tend
                     to be
                     based
                     on a study of computer architecture, algorithms and the
                     major software
                     components of the day, i.e. compilers and assemblers, operating<br>
                     systems and databases. That was sound. Today of course the
                     range
                     of major pieces of software on even home computers is enormous.
                     Despite this computing courses tend still to have a similar
                     shape.
                     This also applies to software engineering courses though
                     these may
                     include greater attention to a period of industrial experience.</p>
                   <p> In the UK generally there is considerable diversity in
                     the
                     constitutional parts of a software engineering degree. The
                     differences tend to revolve around the underpinning theory,
                     to
                     formal methods in software engineering, data communications,
                     etc.,
                     as well, of course, as choice of language or choice of system.
                     Most
                     of them do have a mathematical component based on discrete
                     mathematics, they have a compulsory individual project,
                     they involve
                     group work, an exposure to the design of tools and an element
                     that
                     addresses professional and ethical issues in a considerable
                     fashion.</p>
                   <p> Enlightened approaches to education in Computer Science
                     see this
                     as a new discipline. This follows the work of Denning (see
                     [Denning
                     et al, 1989] and [Denning, 1992]). Then each topic within
                     a degree
                     is characterised by knowledge and understanding, theory,
                     practice,
                     applications and the development of a set of professional
                     attitudes 
                     to the subject.</p>
                   <p> There is evidence that in the UK software engineering
                     is in a healthy state. The numbers of courses are increasing
                     and the number of students applying to undertake study in
                     it are increasing. In 1997-8 there was an increase in applications
                     over session 1996-7 in excess of 20%.</p>
                   <p>3. Professional Certification</p>
                   <p> In the UK there is currently no requirement for software
                     engineers
                     to be accredited or licensed, even if they work on high
                     integrity
                     systems. Nevertheless the issue is in the professional consciousness.</p>
                   <p> At university level undergraduate degrees in software
                     engineering are subject to accreditation by the professional
                     institutions, notably the British Computer Society and the
                     Institution of Electrical<br>
                     Engineers. These bodies - or rather a team composed of distinguished
                     academics and industrialists and with the authority of these
                     bodies - scrutinise degrees and offer accreditation status
                     provided the courses seem well-founded, sound, properly
                     resourced, etc. Such accreditation means that graduating
                     students can
                     become
                     Chartered
                     Engineers provided they complete a two-year period of relevant
                     industrial experience. So formally Software Engineers are
                     finally
                     regarded as part of the engineering community (though there
                     remains
                     pockets of resistance).</p>
                   <p> Currently in the UK there is a Study Group involving
                     industrialists, the professional bodies, and the UK Health
                       and Safety
                     Executive considering the development of a set of competencies
                     for
                     safety related systems practitioners. The purpose of this
                     is to
                     provide guidance to industry generally on the competencies
                     that should
                     be possessed by those working in the area of safety related
                     systems.
                     A significant aspect of this relates to the development
                     of software
                     systems. There is a deep concern that the document emerging
                     from
                     this study should be seen as support and guidance, not any
                     duplicitous
                     step towards formal registration or licensing. Nevertheless
                     there will
                     be interest in seeing how industry responds to the document,
                     and to
                     whether they wish to see some form of formal assessment
                     introduced.
                     This is for the future.</p>
                   <p>4. Thoughts for the Future</p>
                   <p> Currently there is a wide range of software engineering
                     provision throughout the UK. The implied diversity is to
                     be expected in such a rapidly changing discipline which
                     can accommodate many and varied
                     approaches.</p>
                   <p> Within the UK the Government's Quality Agencies are moving
                     in the
                     direction of introducing 'standards' - whatever that may
                     entail. In
                     devising these standards there is a serious danger that
                     the approach
                     has the effect of producing national curricula. That would
                     be a
                     great pity and a disservice to young people, but it could
                     easily
                     happen. At some stage the introduction of this standard
                     will surely
                     have a highly significant effect on the teaching of software
                     engineering and it could possibly reduce the diversity of
                     provision.</p>
                   <p> As to the subject matter itself, the needs of industry
                     are
                     changing. While there remains a need for those who can develop
                     high quality code, in many quarters there is a shift in
                     emphasis
                     towards the development of large systems. That needs a new
                     perspective, a new approach and new skills. The proper utilisation
                     and acceptance of large software systems will also depend
                     on high
                     quality user interfaces and considerable attention to user
                     needs.
                     Again this heralds a shift in perspective.</p>
                   <p> It has already been mentioned that much education in Computing
                     is
                     based on a view of the subject which is about 20 years old.
                     Why
                     should software engineers not learn about the design and
                     development
                     of word processing systems, spreadsheets, mail merge systems,
                     web
                     browsers, games software, etc., rather than compilers, operating
                     systems, databases. A re-appraisal of the underlying issues
                     is called
                     for.</p>
                   <p> In addition the present software systems are ever more
                     sophisticated and really software engineers ought to understand
                     the
                     architectures behind these, how they are put together and
                     why. All the
                     underlying principles of software integration and software
                     re-use need
                     to be fully understood. At the moment many of these issues
                     scarcely
                     merit any mention in many software engineering courses.
                     In part this
                     is because software engineering is not yet fully mature
                     as a
                     discipline ... and new developments will lead to changes
                     to curricula.
                     But it is also because the rate of change is considerable.
                     Remaining
                     up-to-date, keeping a healthy interest and acquaintance
                     with current
                     trends is time-consuming and problematic ... but software
                     engineering
                     educators need to respond.</p>

                   <p>Software Engineering Coordinating Committee Formed</p>
                   <p>ACM and IEEE-CS have approved the formation of a Software
                     Engineering Coordinating Committee (SWECC), which will represent
                     ACM and the IEEE Computer Society in dealing with software
                     engineering matters. This
                     committee will officially come into being on 1 January0
                     1999, and be
                     a successor to the Joint IEEE Computer Society and ACM Steering
                     Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering
                     as a

                   <p>* Review I/U Working Group report/paper</p>
                   <p>* Review paper vs. detailed interviews</p>
                   <p>* Future Plans:<br>
                     * Paper - submit to conference, journal<br>
                     * Name of paper<br>
                     * SEI report</p>
                   <p>* CSEE&amp;T Panel</p>
                   <p>* What next?</p>
                   <p></p>
                   <p>Following are the notes and activities that Nancy and George
                     completed<br>
                     during this meeting:</p>
                   <p>* Review I/U Working Group report/paper:</p>
                   <p>* The first paragraph is not historically correct - Nancy
                     will check her notes<br>
                     * The background could become the introduction and provide
                     an outline for the rest of the paper<br>
                     * An abstract is needed (George will get with Greg Cohen
                     and see if we can get some assistance here)</p>
                   <p>######################################################################</p>
                   <p>* Review paper vs. detailed interviews:</p>
                   <p>* A suggestion was made - If we make this a report rather
                     than a paper, the report could possibly consist of the paper
                     plus the original surveys and summary plus the follow-up
                     interviews and summary.<br>
                     * A question for all of the Working Group - Is there a problem
                     with using the information supplied by the collaborations
                     in a report?<br>
                     * The paper should state who the collaborations are <br>
                     * Was there a check made between the name of the collaboration
                     and the type of collaboration?<br>
                     * The report should list all thirteen respondents<br>
                     * References are needed:<br>
  IEEE Software Paper, a reference for Kirkpatrick Model (Nancy or Cynthia may
  have this), our own CSEE&amp;T '99 Panel</p>
                   <p>* Future Plans:</p>
                   <p>* Paper name - here is a suggestion to start with &quot;A
                     MODEL FOR INDUSTRY/UNIVERSITY COLLABORATIONS IN SOFTWARE
                     ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND TRAINING&quot;</p>

                     * Do more brainstorming (conference calls can be used).
                     Each member of the Working Group should present topics in
                     more depth (1 paragraph) at our next meeting or earlier
                     at one of our conference calls.<br>

                     ======================================================================</p>
                   <p>Team 2 of the Working Group is concerned with study, discussion,
                     activities and proposals concerning two issues:<br>
                     * the content of the software engineering profession<br>
                     * software engineering curriculum design and development</p>
                   <p>Participants:<br>
                     Don Bagert, Tom Hilburn, Greg Hislop, Mike Lutz, Susan Mengel,
                       Mike McCracken, Hossein Saiedian</p>
                   <p>1. The Team discussed the feedback about the Guidelines
                     received in the past six months. The comments received were
                     generally favorable. The team decided to change the name
                     of the Guidelines for Software<br>
                     Education to Guidelines for Software Engineering Education.</p>
                   <p>2. The primary activity of the Team was devoted to the
                     development of a draft of a &quot;curriculum model&quot; for
                     software engineering focused undergraduate degree programs
                     in computing. A copy of an &quot;outline
                     draft&quot; of
                     the curriculum model is at http://erau.db.erau.edu/~hilburn/se-educ/.
                     The Team decided the model needs additional elements:<br>
                     a. organize the curriculum content elements into &quot;knowledge
                     units&quot;<br>
                     b. describe a process that can be use to map the knowledge
                     units into course and curricula.<br>
                     c. develop sample curricula in the following areas<br>
                     * B.S. in Software Engineering<br>
                     * B.S. in Computer Science<br>
                     * B.S. in Information Systems<br>
                     * B.S. in Computer Engineering</p>
                   <p>3. The Team planned its work through May 1999.</p>
                   <p>(Editorial note: The plan was originally in a Word table.
                     This got flattened in conversion to EMail. The original
                     version is available from Tom Hilburn) </p>

                   <p>My students are compiling a web site for faculty and students
                     of Computer and Professional Ethics. While we plan to beautify
                       and fill in some holes over the break, we would like to
                     get some preliminary feedback from FASE readers. </p>
                   <p>The Computer Ethics site provides links to useful web pages 
                     for a &quot;Computer Ethics&quot; style of class. Professional
                     Ethics is primarily related to the work of the Joint Task

                   <p>The successful candidates will be selected from applicants
                     with
                     strong research programs in systems areas including Software

                     Traditional
                     Computer Science. We have experienced very rapid growth
                     in enrollment
                     in recent years. The University is located in the most attractive
                     suburbs of the Dallas metropolitan area. There are over

                     Systems. Almost all the country's leading telecommunication's
                     companies have major research and development facilities
                     in our
                     neighborhood. Opportunities for joint university-industry
                     research
                     projects and consulting are excellent. </p>
                   <p>In addition to individual faculty workstations, the department
                     has
                     six computer/research laboratories, equipped with high performance
                     workstations and high-end PCs. The Academic Computer Center
                     supports
                     both UNIX based workstations and PCs. Computers on campus
                     are
                     connected via Ethernet and have access to Internet. Students
                     and
                     faculty have dial-in access to campus computing facilities. <br>

                   <p>The Forum for Advancing Software engineering Education
                     (FASE) is published on the 15th of each month by the FASE
                     editorial board. <br>
                     <br>
                     Send newsletter articles to one of the editors, preferably
                     by
                     category: Articles pertinent to corporate and government
                     training to
                     Kathy Beckman &lt;Kathy.Beckman@cdsi.com&gt;; Academic education,
                     and all
                     other categories to Don Bagert &lt;bagert@ttu.edu&gt;. Items
                     must be
                     submitted by the 8th of the month in order to be considered
                     for
                     inclusion in that month's issue. Also, please see the submission
                     guidelines immediately below.</p>
                   <p>FASE submission format guidelines: All submissions must
                     be in ASCII
                     format, and contain no more than 70 characters per line
                     (71 including
                     the new line character). This 70-character/line format must
                     be
                     viewable in a text editor such as Microsoft Notepad WITHOUT
                     using a
                   &quot;
                     word wrap&quot; facility. All characters (outside of the
                     newline) should in the ASCII code range from 32 to 126 (i.e. &quot;printable&quot; in
                     DOS text<br>
                     mode).</p>

                       Everyone that is receiving this is on the FASE mailing
                       list. If you wish to leave this list, write to</p>
                   <p> &lt;listproc@listserv.ttu.edu&gt;</p>
                   <p>and, in the text of your message (not the subject line),
                     write:</p>

                       To rejoin (or have someone else join) the FASE mailing
                       list, write to</p>
                   <p> subscribe fase &lt;Your Name&gt;</p>
                   <p>For instance, if your name is Jane Smith, write:</p>
                   <p> subscribe fase Jane Smith But what if you have something
                     that you want to share with everyone <br>
                     else, before the next issue? For more real-time discussion,
                     there is the FASE-TALK discussion list. It is our hope that
                     it will be to FASE readers what the SIGCSE.members listserv
                     is to that group. (For those of you that don't know, SIGCSE
                   is the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education.) </p>
                   <p>To subscribe to the FASE-TALK list, write to</p>
                   <p> &lt;listproc@listserv.ttu.edu&gt;</p>
                   <p>and, in the text of your message (not the subject line),
                     write:</p>
                   <p> subscribe fase-talk &lt;Your Name&gt; </p>
                   <p>For instance, if your name is Jane Smith, write:</p>
                   <p> subscribe fase-talk Jane Smith</p>
                   <p>Please try to limit FASE-TALK to discussion items related
                     to software engineering education and training; CFPs and
                     other such items can still be submitted to the editor for
                     inclusion
                     into FASE. Anyone that belongs to the FASE-TALK mailing
                     list can post
                     to it.</p>
                   <p>FASE-TALK is also used by the editors for &quot;breaking
                     stories&quot; i.e. news that we feel that you would want
                     to hear about before the next issue of FASE comes out. (We
                     do this sparingly, though.)</p>
                   <p>As always, there is no cost for subscribing to either FASE
                     or FASE-TALK!</p>
