 <p>I propose certain changes to the Software Engineering Code 
 
                     of Ethics,
 
                     Version 3, as published by the IEEE-CS/ACM Joint Task Force 
 
                     on Software
 
                     Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices. My proposal 
 
                     can be divided
 
                     into three parts:</p>
 
                   <p>1 Changes in the form<br>
 
                     2 Changes in the Priciples<br>
 
                     3 Other changes and comments</p>
 
                   <p> 1 Changes in the form<br>
 
                     ---------------------</p>
 
                   <p>I propose that the form be changed from 2 parts (Preamble 
 
                     and Principles)
 
                     to 3 parts, namely Preamble, Principles and Clauses. This 
 
                     should mainly
 
                     serve the separation of the Principles and the Clauses. In 
 
                     the current
 
                     version these are combined, so that somebody wanting to consider 
 
                     the
 
                     Principles on their own can NOT do so without a major effort.</p>
 
                   <p>In the new form the Preamble would stay as it is, the Principles 
 
                     would be
 
                     separated (example see in Part 2 of this proposal) and the 
 
                     Clauses
 
                     would have the following form:</p>
 
                   <p>CLAUSES</p>
 
                   <p>Principle N: PRINCIPLE_NAME</p>
 
                   <p> &lt;Principle text as given in PRINCIPLES followed by&gt;<br>
 
                     In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
 
                   <p> aspire to:<br>
 
                     N.01. Text of the clause...</p>
 
                   <p> ...</p>
 
                   <p> be expected to:<br>
 
                     N.xx. Text of the clause...</p>
 
                   <p> ...</p>
 
                   <p> be demanded to:<br>
 
                     N.yy. Text of the clause...</p>
 
                   <p> ...</p>
 
                   <p>The new subheaders &quot;aspire to&quot; etc. should clarify 
 
                     the intent of the
 
                     clauses as described in the Preamble.</p>
 
                   <p> 2 Changes in the Priciples<br>
 
                     --------------------------</p>
 
                   <p>This part should illustrate the form in which the &quot;Principle&quot; 
 
                     part of
 
                     the Code could be given as well as present some changes I 
 
                     feel should
 
                     be introduced.</p>
 
                   <p>First the form of the new &quot;Principle&quot; text:</p>
 
                   <p>PRINCIPLES</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 1: PROFESSION</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, in all professional matters, advance
 
                     both the integrity and reputation of their profession.</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 2: SELF</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall practice their professional work 
 
                     to
 
                     the best of their knowledge and ability. Outside of professional
 
                     engagements they should strive to live an integral life.</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 3: PUBLIC</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, in their professional role, act 
 
                     only in
 
                     ways consistent with the public safety, health and welfare.
 
                     This principle is implicitly included in all the other principles
 
                     of this code.</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 4: PRODUCT</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, ensure that 
 
                     the
 
                     software on which they work is useful and of acceptable quality 
 
                     to
 
                     the public, the employer, the client, and the user; completed 
 
                     on
 
                     time and at reasonable cost; and free of error.</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 5: JUDGMENT</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, protect both 
 
                     the
 
                     independence of their professional judgment and their reputation
 
                     for such judgment.</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 6: SELFIMPROVEMENT</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, throughout their career, strive 
 
                     to
 
                     enhance their own ability to practice their profession as 
 
                     it
 
                     should be practiced.</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 7: CLIENT AND EMPLOYER</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall always act in professional matters 
 
                     as
 
                     faithful agents and trustees of their client or employer.</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 8: COLLEAGUES</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall treat all those with whom they 
 
                     work
 
                     fairly and take positive steps to support collegial activities.</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 9: MANAGEMENT</p>
 
                   <p> A software engineer in a management, leadership or teaching 
 
                     capacity
 
                     shall act fairly and shall enable and encourage those who 
 
                     they lead to
 
                     meet their own and collective obligations, including those 
 
                     under
 
                     this code.</p>
 
                   <p>You will notice that I reordered the Principles, as well 
 
                     as added an
 
                     additional one. Let me start with the new Principle: I called 
 
                     it SELF,
 
                     renaming at the same time the old SELF to (in my eyes more 
 
                     appropriate)
 
                     SELFIMPROVEMENT. The reason for the new Principle is twofold. 
 
                     The first
 
                     sentence is supposed to sum up the intent which lies more 
 
                     or less implicit
 
                     in all the other Principles but is never explicitely stated. 
 
                     The second
 
                     sentence should integrate the software engineer in the surrounding
 
                     society which is otherwise unmentioned apart from 6.11. (All 
 
                     the Principles
 
                     are talking about professional behaviour, leaving possibilities 
 
                     like
 
                     stealing software privately a fully legal option).</p>
 
                   <p>I tried to reorder the Principles according to the importance 
 
                     I can read
 
                     into them. Since the Code is a sort of a professional charter, 
 
                     I feel
 
                     that the Profession should come first. The Self and the Public 
 
                     come next,
 
                     as they are the most important actors. Then follows the subject 
 
                     and the
 
                     factors influencing it followed by the other actors. Management 
 
                     comes
 
                     at the end, because it does not necessarily concerns all software 
 
                     engineers.</p>
 
                   <p>Now to the Principles themselves. As a general feature I 
 
                     deleted the
 
                     &quot;public safety&quot; etc. from all of them except Public 
 
                     and declared it
 
                     (in Public) to be a general feature. This should help to make 
 
                     the Principles
 
                     readable. Principle Self is new as described above. Selfimprovement<br>
 
                     is the new name for old &quot;Self&quot; as described above. 
 
                     I extended the Management
 
                     Principle to include teaching, because teaching is also a 
 
                     variant of
 
                     a leadership role.</p>
 
                   <p> 3 Other changes and comments<br>
 
                     ----------------------------</p>
 
                   <p>In addition to the two previous themes I have some comments 
 
                     on the text
 
                     itself:</p>
 
                   <p>PREAMBLE</p>
 
                   <p>Point 1:</p>
 
                   <p> The Code contains eight Principles related to the behavior 
 
                     of and ... nine if you accept my new Principle</p>
 
                   <p>Point 2:</p>
 
                   <p> ... second level obliges software engineering professionals 
 
                     to more
 
                     challenging obligations than those required at level one. 
 
                     ...
 
       </p>
 
                   <p>perhaps</p>
 
                   <p> ... second level obliges software engineering professionals 
 
                     to more specific obligations than those required at level 
 
                     one. ... </p>
 
                   <p>(some might percieve level one obligations to be more challenging!)</p>
 
                   <p>Point 3:</p>
 
                   <p>I would like to change</p>
 
                   <p> care to people affected by their work. The third and deeper 
 
                     level
 
                     comprises several obligations which derive directly from elements
 
                     unique to the professional practice of software engineering. 
 
                     The
 
                     Clauses of each Principle are illustrations of the various 
 
                     levels
 
                     of obligation included in that relationship.</p>
 
                   <p> The Clauses under each Principle consist of three different 
 
                     types
 
                     of statement corresponding to each level. ...</p>
 
                   to
 
                   <p> care to people affected by their work. The third and deeper 
 
                     level
 
                     comprises several obligations which derive directly from elements
 
                     unique to the professional practice of software engineering.</p>
 
                   <p> The Clauses of each Principle are illustrations of the various
 
                     levels of obligation included in that relationship. They include
 
                     three different types of statement corresponding to each level. 
 
                     ...</p>
 
                   <p>That way the division between Principles and Clauses might 
 
                     be made clearer.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     Point 4:</p>
 
                   <p> Although all three levels of professional obligation are 
 
                     recognized,
 
                   perhaps better</p>

                   <p>Point 5:</p>
 
                   <p> The list of Principles and Clauses is not exhaustive , perhaps 
 
                     better</p>

                   <p>CLAUSES (numbering as in the original text)</p>
 
                   <p>Point 7:</p>
 
                   <p> 1.03. Ensure that they are qualified, by an appropriate
 
                     combination of education and experience, for any project
 
                     on which they work or propose to work.</p>
 
                   <p>Willingness to learn should be included (compare 5.03)</p>
 
                   <p>Point 8:</p>
 
                   <p> 1.11. Be careful to use only accurate data derived from
 
                     legal sources, and use only in ways properly authorized.
 
                     and use it only ...??
 
       </p>
 
                   <p>Point 9:</p>
 
                   <p>2.03 and 3.02 might be less redundant and better categorised 
 
                     as follows:</p>
 
                   <p> 2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared
 
                     under their supervision or within their areas of
 
                     competence.</p>
 
                   <p> 3.02 Affix their signature only to documents
 
                     with which they are in agreement.</p>
 
                   <p>Point 10:</p>
 
                   <p> 4.04. Not knowingly use illegally obtained or retained
 
                     software.</p>
 
                   <p>&quot;knowingly&quot; might be superfluous.</p>
 
                   <p>Point 11:</p>
 
                   <p> 4.05. Keep as confidential information gained in their
 
                     professional work that is not in the public domain,
 
                     where such confidentiality is not inconsistent with
 
                     matters of public concern.</p>
 
                   <p>Should be probably worded similarly to:</p>
 
                   <p> 4.09. ... , unless a
 
                     higher ethical concern is being compromised; then in
 
                     that case the employer or another appropriate authority
 
                     should be informed of the engineer's ethical concern.</p>
 
                   <p>Point 12:</p>
 
                   <p> 6.05. Report anything reasonably believed to be a
 
                     violation of this code to appropriate authorities.</p>
 
                   <p>How about advising/confronting the (unwitting?!) violator 
 
                     first?<br>
 
                     (cmp. also 5.04)</p>
 
                   <p>Point 13:</p>
 
                   <p> 6.07. Only accept remuneration appropriate to
 
                     professional qualifications or experience.</p>
 
                   <p>And if the results are far beyond it? (genius, lucky strike, 
 
                     ...)</p>
 
                   <p>Point 14:</p>
 
                   <p> 6.11. Exercise professional responsibility to society by
 
                     constructively serving in civic affairs.</p>
 
                   <p>I would classify that under the new Self, category &quot;aspire 
 
                     to&quot;,
 
                     perhaps even stretching the envelope a bit.</p>
 
                   <p>Point 15:</p>
 
                   <p> 7.06. Assist colleagues in being fully aware of current
 
                     standard work practices including policies and
 
                     procedures for protecting passwords, files, security
 
                     measures in general, and other confidential information.</p>
 
                   <p>perhaps</p>
 
                   <p> 7.06. Assist colleagues in being fully aware of current
 
                     standard work practices and security measures in general,
 
                     as well as other confidential information.</p>
 
                   <p>because a) spelling out various security measures makes it 
 
                     unreadable
 
                     and b) standard practices and security are different from 
 
                     conf.inf.</p>
 
                   <p>Point 16:</p>
 
                   <p> 7.08. Not undermine another software engineer's job
 
                     prospects for one's own personal gain.</p>
 
                   <p>Does it mean I cannot apply for the same job?</p>
 
                   <p>Point 17:</p>
 
                   <p>2.09, 8.07 and 8.08 would fit in the new &quot;Self&quot;</p>
 
                   <p>Well, that's all! :-)</p>
