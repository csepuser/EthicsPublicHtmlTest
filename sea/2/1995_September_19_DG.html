   Title: &quot;Embracing New Technology&quot;<br>
   Date: Tuesday, September 19, 1995
       <p><br>
   Dear Friend,</p>
       <p>Thank you so much for the suggestions so many, many of you sent in.</p>
       <p>While reading some of your suggestions, I realized that &quot;secrets
         of multiproject OT managers&quot; was too narrow a topic. Seemed like
         the challenges we face are more about...</p>
       <p> Embracing New Technology</p>
       <p>along with some object-specific challenges along the way.</p>
       <p>Yesterday, the traveling team visited ImageBuilder Software, in the
         Portland, Oregon area. I am writing this issue from Portland, just before
         leaving for our second stop on our week-long US tour.</p>
       <p>Thanks for joining in on the tour via e-mail. I hope you'll enjoy this
         and <br>
   other snapshots along the way. :-)</p>
       <p>Sincerely,</p>
       <p>Peter Coad</p>

       <p>Special thanks go to Dwayne Towell, Terry Hamm, David North, Jonathan
         Kern, my <br>
   friends and colleagues at NTT Data, and the many readers of The Coad Letter
   (especially &lt;short list&gt;). This special report would not be possible
   without your kind and thoughtful participation. Thank you very, very much.</p>
       <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
       <p>There is nothing new under the sun.</p>
       <p>Over the past four decades, every new software development advance has
   proclaimed itself as something &quot;new, different, and radical&quot; and
   requiring new 
   management techniques. &lt;insert quotable quotes. candidates: assembly language,
   FORTRAN, C, structured design, objects, distributed objects&gt;</p>
       <p>After seeing this happen time and time again, patterns emerge. A pattern
         is a template; it's a template derived from experiencing something again
         and again -- and then abstracting from those experiences.</p>
       <p>This purpose of this special report is to set forth such a template...
         for 
   managers, team leaders, and team members who will inevitably live through many
       new technology advances during their careers.</p>
       <p>Specific comments come from managers of multiple object technology projects, <br>
   working at these companies:<br>
   (ibs) = ImageBuilder Software<br>
   Dwayne Towell and Terry Hamm<br>
   Multimedia apps<br>
   (aig) = Artificial Intelligence Group<br>
   David North<br>
   Retail and Wholesale apps<br>
   (qti) = Quantum Technologies International<br>
   Jon Kern<br>
   Manufacturing apps</p>
       <p>PROJECT MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES<br>
   Critical success factors<br>
   achievable objectives<br>
   juggle cost, schedule, resources<br>
   manage expectations<br>
   remove obstacles<br>
   deliver a product of acceptable quality<br>
   For new technology<br>
   managing acceptance and use across...<br>
   a pilot project<br>
   a real project<br>
   across multiple projects</p>
       <p>JUSTIFICATION AND READINESS<br>
   Reasons for adoption<br>
   Advantages, compared to other approaches<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   manage complexity<br>
   need to think about fewer parts at a time<br>
   Drawbacks<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   small project, so not that big of a risk<br>
   try it on a small project; no problem falling back to C<br>
   biggest risk: tools were pretty simple in 1989<br>
   Expected results<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   reuse, reliability<br>
   success probably depends more upon the developer<br>
   it's technology that might help<br>
   working with new technology is another way to keep developers<br>
   Assessing readiness / preparing for<br>
   Selling senior management<br>
   find someone willing to listen (an early adopter)<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   our company embraces change; it's okay to try new technology<br>
   find a manager who is a new technology advocate<br>
   then build a small pocket of consensus.<br>
   projects are short (one year or less); risk is low<br>
   (we could always fall back to older technology and<br>
   still get the job done)<br>
   making a defensible business case<br>
   measurable business benefits for a new technology?<br>
   not likely<br>
   increase sr. management visibility into what's really<br>
   going on, in a project<br>
   increase sr. management frequency at seeing working<br>
   results, so they can know what progress is really<br>
   being made (or not being made)<br>
   change is change is change<br>
   change ripples through an organization<br>
   few changes are merely a &quot;quick technical add-on&quot;<br>
   pilot project(s), then serious ones<br>
   reduce risk, allow time to learn, accept some false starts<br>
   justification of investment<br>
   education, tools, consulting<br>
   Criteria for selecting...<br>
   any project<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   interesting work<br>
   good match to our capabilities<br>
   challenging, yet within reach<br>
   your first new technology pilot project<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   who will work on it<br>
   experienced, interested, and available at the right time<br>
   totally new (no old code to deal with)<br>
   3 people, 3-4 months<br>
   afterwards, assign those 3 people to 3 different teams,<br>
   to evangelize, to communicate lessons learned</p>
       <p>PROJECT PLAN<br>
   Outline<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   informal...<br>
   description<br>
   risk, contingencies<br>
   living document!<br>
   somewhat client-dependent (client may own the plan)<br>
   Scope<br>
   Balancing schedule, budget, and resources (people, tools)<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   sr. project managers are responsible<br>
   1-2 day spec; then lead works out a schedule<br>
   breakdown tasks<br>
   project team and framework team work together on estimates<br>
   estimating heuristics<br>
   how long?<br>
   how much?<br>
   how many people?<br>
   personal &quot;fudge factors?&quot;<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   project teams --<br>
   we track what we've been off in the past<br>
   and add a fudge factor each time (say, 20%)<br>
   framework team --<br>
   we double our estimate, to add time for communicating<br>
   with project teams, an essential ingredient for our<br>
   success.<br>
   milestones<br>
   by activity? by measurable results?<br>
   at what intervals?<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   external (client-visible) milestones<br>
   alpha, beta, final (sometimes several of each)<br>
   frequency: every 1-2 months; client gets working<br>
   software<br>
   internal milestones<br>
   what<br>
   spec<br>
   task list and schedule<br>
   get something up (a trivial screen)<br>
   then by features or groupings of features<br>
   product features<br>
   framework features<br>
   plus internal milestones that are placed 1-2 weeks<br>
   before external milestones<br>
   frequency<br>
   every week or two; code goes to QA<br>
   acceptance<br>
   internal -- word of developer, accepted by team leader<br>
   alpha -- all features<br>
   beta -- all level 1 bugs corrected<br>
   when to commit to a schedule?<br>
   what do you do during planning?<br>
   how do you adjust during execution?<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   if meeting the schedule is the highest priority,<br>
   then we add resources to meet it<br>
   Process<br>
   waterfall, incremental<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   incremental<br>
   multimedia scene by scene<br>
   in effect, by feature or feature category<br>
   sometimes we break a scene into two increments:<br>
   rough out, then fill out<br>
   size of increments: whatever fits into about 1-2 weeks of<br>
   development time<br>
   defining milestones; determining milestone completion<br>
   Multiple releases<br>
   how to plan, measure, control?<br>
   (technical issues, administrative issues)<br>
   Progress measurements (and actions taken)<br>
   Keeping on course<br>
   feature creep? feature drift?<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   change controls are in the contract<br>
   some changes are free<br>
   some changes cost a bit<br>
   feature too hard? then we endeavor to negotiate a substitute.<br>
   Measurement and control<br>
   what do you measure?<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   features completed<br>
   bug rate; levels 1-4 (1 is worst kind); meeting certain<br>
   milestones means no known bugs of a certain severity<br>
   level.<br>
   what is helpful; what is not</p>
       <p>TEAM MEMBERS<br>
   Skills<br>
   joy of learning, love to learn<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   self-motivated ones<br>
   track record for originating new ideas<br>
   for new technology, a lack of experience with earlier<br>
   technology may be a plus (less change resistance)<br>
   technology-specific experience<br>
   project experience, workshop experience, books, articles<br>
   looking across multiple dimensions<br>
   conation (the will to do)<br>
   quick start, fact finder, implementer, follow-though<br>
   intelligences<br>
   linguistic, mathematical-logical, spatial, bodily-<br>
   kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal<br>
   learning styles<br>
   visual, auditory, kinesthetic<br>
   Selecting team members<br>
   selecting from a talent pool<br>
   reserving the right of refusal<br>
   partial vs. full-time dedication<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   always prefer full-time assignments<br>
   might have a part-time maintenance responsibility, too<br>
   partial dedication is much less efficient<br>
   as it is written, &quot;no man can serve two masters&quot;<br>
   why, when, and how to say farewell to a team member<br>
   Keeping key players<br>
   most important benefits, qualities<br>
   competition other projects, other companies<br>
   holding till the next project<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   short projects (3-6 months) means that inadvertent people<br>
   mismatches are short-lived<br>
   project teams don't stick together; for the most part, people<br>
   are reassigned at the end of a project.<br>
   Moving to multidisciplinary teams<br>
   putting together team members that competed<br>
   in a past approach<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   it's important to give someone clear authority to make<br>
   decisions; would prefer to not put old rivals on the same<br>
   team, if at all possible.<br>
   Recruiting experienced developers</p>
       <p>TEAMS<br>
   A team and its members; a project and its teams<br>
   size<br>
   (ibs) 3-5 people<br>
   skill mix<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   lead, 2-3 programmers, an artist, a media coordinator,<br>
   a QA person<br>
   lead reports to a senior project manager (someone <br>
   watching over about 4 projects at a time)<br>
   mix of experienced developers and recent grads<br>
   assignments for each team member (dividing up the work to be done)<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   by aptitude, experience, interests<br>
   by features or feature categories<br>
   by similar features (reuse code, or at least reuse their<br>
   thinking and learning about building such a feature)<br>
   who sees the big picture for an app?<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   small apps, with hope that everyone does develop the big<br>
   picture<br>
   who owns what?<br>
   who decides which way to go?<br>
 &quot;my way is better&quot; problem<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   educate; impose the change<br>
   resolve technical squabbles at a technical (not executive<br>
   level)<br>
 &quot;no clear leader&quot; trap<br>
   (ibs) fully agree -- that's a trap<br>
   committee decisions foster change resistance (and delays)<br>
   with multiple teams, who insures that the pieces fit together?<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   the (technical) manager who is responsible for the teams<br>
   the teams themselves; each is developing software and must<br>
   get the software working together every week or two.<br>
   Decisions<br>
   sole tech leader?<br>
   senior tech team?<br>
   size?<br>
   skill mix?<br>
   how often?<br>
   Transition to team leadership<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   take a close look at one's skill set<br>
   don't drag someone along; career counseling<br>
   provide a technical advancement path<br>
   Team location<br>
   same room? adjoining offices? same floor? same building?<br>
   same state? same country? same planet?<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   same room (low modular walls within)<br>
   feel very strongly about positioning teams together<br>
   not by discipline (programmers, artists, ...)<br>
   why: effective communication<br>
   we do a lot of &quot;communication by running around&quot;<br>
   projects change, and yes, people change offices, too.<br>
   Effective communications<br>
   within a team<br>
   between teams<br>
   with customers, business experts<br>
   working together<br>
   how soon? how much? how often?<br>
   ways of working together<br>
   assessment of needs/tasks/problems?<br>
   models? role playing of major interactions?<br>
   with sr. management<br>
   managing expectations (initially; along the way)</p>
       <p>PEOPLEWARE<br>
   Growing a vital corporate culture<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   fun place to work<br>
   accept a 40-hour work week for what it is: 40 hours<br>
   exceptions 2-3 times per year, for 2-3 weeks at a time;<br>
   no more<br>
   Little things that show you care<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   goodies<br>
   project T-shirts<br>
   small tokens for accomplishments<br>
   box of programmer food<br>
 &quot;reward kit&quot; when a product ships<br>
   lunch together<br>
   conference<br>
   good experience with platform-specific programming<br>
   conferences<br>
   Keeping your top talent<br>
   (ibs) this is something we are very good at.<br>
   interesting work<br>
   new challenges, new opportunities<br>
   some autonomy, some creative freedom<br>
   assignments with good interpersonal fit<br>
   variety (not stuck doing the same old thing)<br>
   compensation<br>
   salary and benefit surveys, to compete in local market<br>
   incentive stock options<br>
   location<br>
   being in a community that has a culture supportive of<br>
   longer-term employment at a company<br>
   Training and consulting (mentoring)<br>
   outside? inside? mix?<br>
   when helpful? when not? when time to change?<br>
   for the first project<br>
   for subsequent projects<br>
   Encouraging (overcoming resistance to) change<br>
   those who find difficulty<br>
   those who find it hard to let go of a past approach<br>
   those who outright refuse to change<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   keep going, hope they'll come along<br>
   just a few holdouts; they'll change of move on<br>
   education helps in this area, but not always<br>

   who builds it? who reuses it? who maintains it?<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   some false starts<br>
   we tried building for reuse on a project.<br>
   that contradicts the primary success measures for<br>
   a project.<br>
   we tried building for reuse by committee.<br>
   someone had to be responsible.<br>
   we tried building for reuse in an ad hoc way.<br>
   vision was needed.<br>
   we tried building for reuse on a part-time basis.<br>
   yet full-time development assignments always work<br>
   out better.<br>
   success with<br>
   small, dedicated team<br>
   fewer opinions, fewer arguments<br>
   very experienced team members<br>
   features<br>
   app teams and project proposal teams suggest new<br>
   framework features<br>
   framework team, working with senior project managers,<br>
   prioritizes those features<br>
   criteria: likelihood of reuse, level of<br>
   difficulty for app developers, needs of<br>
   future apps<br>
   ownership<br>
   framework team responsible for all framework code<br>
   development and maintenance<br>
   note that bug fix urgency is often much higher<br>
   for a framework developer<br>
   People and reuse<br>
   getting people to build things for reuse<br>
   rewards? dictatorial rule?<br>
   getting people to reuse<br>
   getting people to design and code for maintainability<br>
   Getting started<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   at first, it was easier to scrap previous results and start<br>
   over each time (great pain to reuse existing code; we did<br>
   it at times; it still was a great pain to do, though)<br>
   Discovering something with potential for reuse<br>
   before building something for reuse, build it as part of an app,<br>
   without worrying about building for reuse<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   we learned some things this way that we would have never<br>
   learned, if someone had expected us to build it right<br>
   the very first time.<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   don't expect a project to develop reusable software.<br>
   why: a project has different goals, different urgencies<br>
   look for what could be reused<br>
   by apps within the problem domain you are working in<br>
   Organizing for reuse<br>
   develop a skeleton, a framework, for a family of apps in the same<br>
   basic business area<br>
   a framework establishes an overall structure, a perspective that<br>
   other developers can build upon<br>
   Building for reuse<br>
   build for reuse across a family of apps<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   fit it into a growing framework<br>
   always use a separate reuse team, when building for reuse<br>
   use the &quot;reusable&quot; code the first time -- and refine it<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   begin to see what assumptions you've made that might<br>
   impede subsequent reuse<br>
   the framework, a hierarchy of application-specific classes,<br>
   made reuse practical for us.<br>
   so we've been developing C++ apps for 6 years; over the past<br>
   year, we've gained business advantage from reuse -- and<br>
   will continue to do so as long as we build software in<br>
   the same basic problem domain.<br>
   Getting others to reuse<br>
   reuse implies benefits, at some cost<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   framework users get a lot, yet must work within the<br>
   organizational structure imposed by a framework<br>
   make it easier for project teams to justify using the <br>
   framework (easier for them to build their apps)<br>
   weed out developers with a &quot;not invented here&quot; attitude<br>
   freedom on amount of reuse<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   project teams free to reuse that which will help them reach<br>
   their goals<br>
   project teams free to use whatever version of the framework<br>
   they want (freeze; most current; or every couple of<br>
   weeks)<br>
   keep in the design loop, encouraging reuse along the way<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   framework developers are available for design brainstorming,<br>
   discussions, inspections, and reviews -- design issues,<br>
   including (but not limited to) the effective use of the<br>
   framework<br>
   in this way, framework developers gain insights into on-<br>
   going successes and failures that developers are having<br>
   when using the framework<br>
   framework developers spend one-half of their time here<br>
   documentation<br>
   (ibs)<br>
 &quot;how to think about it&quot; document<br>
   all other documentation for framework users is in the<br>
   header files<br>
   training<br>
   lots of practical, how-to examples<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   demo program<br>
   startup program, ready to start building an app<br>
   how to do movies, sound channels, etc.<br>
   Measuring reuse<br>
   Paying for reusable software<br>
   overhead, at first<br>
   projects that use the framework, after that<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   projects are the framework team's clients<br>
   projects that use the framework are charged for it<br>
   project cost estimates include framework usage costs.<br>

       <p>BEST ADVICE -- some &quot;top 10 or so&quot; lists<br>
 &quot;Top 10 or so&quot; list of things to DO<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   1. Get right people (skills, attitudes, preferences).<br>
   2. Complete a product spec.<br>
   3. Find ways to reuse code and effort.<br>
   4. Gradually develop a domain-based app framework.<br>
   5. Recruit team leaders with vision.<br>
   6. Emphasize communications between teams.<br>
   (&quot;No matter what they tell you, it's always a people<br>
   problem.&quot; Weinberg)<br>
   7. Give teams some autonomy.<br>
   e.g., when a project downloads the latest framework<br>
   e.g., how much of the framework a project makes use of<br>
   8. Build a prototype and get a &quot;buy off&quot; from the customer.<br>
   Having a prototype is worth a million words (a helpful<br>
   communication tool).<br>
   9. Seek out fun projects (interesting, fun to work on).<br>
   10. Gain experience by taking many small steps.<br>
   (Everything gets better with experience).<br>
   11. Keep teams small (3-6); keep framework team even smaller (2).</p>
       <p> &quot;Top 10 or so&quot; list of things to NOT DO<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   1. Don't over-staff (keep teams small; allow time to get the<br>
   job done).<br>
   2. Don't operate in panic mode. Or in overtime mode.<br>
   (occasional extra hours are okay, just not the norm;<br>
   managers work those extra hours, too; meals, too)<br>
   3. Don't assume people are interchangeable (not so).<br>
   4. Don't throw away experience (capture experience in your<br>
   framework).<br>
   5. Do not design by committee (one or two people decide).<br>
   6. Don't oversell the prototype (keep their imaginations<br>
   from running away).</p>
       <p> &quot;Top 10 or so&quot; things that we would have done differently<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   1. Exclusive, separate framework team sooner.<br>
   2. Have the design that has taken us numerous iterations<br>
   to get to.<br>
   3. Projects that we took on that were not good for people<br>
   or for the company (wisdom for what business we will do,<br>
   though).<br>
   4. Would have stressed education much more. If it helped people<br>
   learn and change earlier, that would have made it worth it.</p>
       <p> &quot;Top 10 or so&quot; risks and corresponding actions<br>
   (ibs)<br>
   1. Building a framework is a risk. Will payoff ever happen?<br>
   Began as part of a working project.<br>
   Then pulled out the team, a non-revenue producing team.<br>
   Add costs whenever they bid a project.<br>
   Payoff appeared on second or third project.<br>
   2. Project-specific risks<br>
   Technical risks (feature with acceptable performance)<br>
   Attempt to alleviate through prototyping (scope<br>
   the problem; see if you can get in the ballpark).<br>
   People risks (key people leave)<br>
   Recruit through referrals within your company<br>
   (at least half).<br>
   Challenge, fun, and rewards.<br>
   Team risks (teams not gelling together)<br>
   Skill levels<br>
   Rankings, subjective evaluations (annual)<br>
   Project leaders with great people skills --<br>
   counseling, encouraging communication</p>
