         Ethics and Professional Practices </strong></p>
       <p align="center">Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering 
         as a Profession Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices 
         (SEEPP) Task Force, Software Engineering Institute, Satday Jan. 29,1994 
       </p>
       <p>Attendees: Mario Barbacci, Don Gotterbarn, Robert Melford </p>
       <p> The purpose of the meeting was to identify the activities of the task 
         force charged with the implementation of recommendation #3 of the Steering 
         Committee for the Establishment of Software <br>
         Engineering as a Profession. </p>
       <p>I Organization of the Task Farce</p>
       <p> The task force will be lead by appointed co-chairs representing the 
         IEEE Computer Society (CS) <br>
         and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). 'Ihe task force will 
         be a small body, relying on focus groups and surveys to conduct its work. 
         In addition, it will work in coodination with the task forces implementing 
         the other recommendations of the Steering Committee. The task force will 
         use a standards development model as process for its activities. </p>
       <p><br>
         II Scope of the Task Force </p>
       <p>The original recommendation to the Board of Governores of the omputer 
         Society focussed too <br>
         narrowly on the term &quot;Code of Ethics&quot;. This task force will 
         focus on both &quot;Ethicsn-and &quot;Standards of Practice&quot;. The 
         latter provide a) Guidance to resolve conflicts (in Software Engineering 
         the players include users, developers, employers, regulators, others), 
         b) Standards of quality, and c) Responsibility for understanding the implications 
         of one's work. </p>
       <p> In addition, the task force will address cultural and national differences 
         that bear on the definition of Software Engineering Ethics and Professional 
         Practices. </p>
       <p>III Components of the Task Force. </p>
       <p>The task force will include participants with links to other relevant 
         entities and professions, e.g: <br>
         Technologists (most members of the task force also fit this category) 
       </p>

       <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
       <p> February 22,1994 </p>
       <p>To: Council</p>
       <p> From: Stu Zweben </p>
       <p>Subj: Update on &quot;Software Engineering as a Profession&quot; </p>
       <p> At its August 1993 meeting, Council endorsed ACM7s participation in 
         a project related to evaluating/establishing software engineering as a 
         profession. This project was to address <br>
         questions such as the current state of the practice of software engineering 
         and the body of knowledge required of those who practice software engineering; 
         issues relative to the licensing, certification and registration of software 
         engineers; and issues relative to educational curricula and accreditation 
         in software engineering. </p>
       <p> Council preferred that, if possible, ACM work with IEEE-CS on this project, 
         recognizing that IEEE-CS then was in the process of establishing a steering 
         committee of its own to address this subject. Council also delegated to 
         the Executive Committee the responsibility of managing this activity for 
         ACM, including making any relevant appointments and providing necessary 
         funding. I was appointed to the IEEE-CS steering committee shortly after 
         the ACM meetings in August. Other members of the committee are Mario Barbacci 
         of SEI (the Chair), Fletcher Buckley of General Electric, L a . Druffel 
         of SEI, Norm Schneidewind of Naval Postgraduate School, Win Royce of TRW, 
         and Elliot Chikofsky of Northeastern University. The IEEE-CS President 
         (formerly Jim Aylor, currently Laurel Kaleda) serves ex-officio on the 
         committee. The steering committee reported to the IEEE-CS Governing Board 
         in November 1993. A copy of that report is attached. (Note that Chikofsky 
         wasn't on the committee then; he was added recently. ) For several months, 
         I worked to get the steering committee to address first the questions 
         of body of knowledge and current state of the practice; the November report 
         indicates that the committee was in fact in agreement with this direction. 
         I also worked to make ACM an equal partner in this project. Finally, I 
         briefed other software engineering colleagues on this project, notably 
         at a birds of-a-feather session held at the January 1994 SEI Conference 
         on Software Engineering Education. <br>
         I also briefed the ACM EC on this project at various times, and discussed 
         the project with the ACM Board Chairs and EC at our CPC meeting in December 
         1993. </p>
       <p> Meanwhile, in December 1993, Mario Barbacci convened a meeting of some 
         indusmal representatives to the SEI to launch a &quot;task force on the 
         body of knowledge required of software engineers,&quot; which is being 
         chaired by Patricia Douglas of IBM Skill Dynamics. A survey is being prepared, 
         the purpose of which is to get significant input from several companies 
         about the <br>
         definition of this body of knowledge. Another task force was launched 
         in January 1994, co-chaired by Bob Melford of Melford and Associates and 
         Don Gotterbarn of E. Tennessee State Univ. This task force is to develop 
         a &quot;draft standard of software engineering professional practices.&quot; 
       </p>
       <p> Some planning has been done to organiz a third task force that would 
         deal with educational issues related to the software engineering project. 
         The Education Board Chairs of the two societies have been invited to meet 
         with the steering committee chair to discuss this aspect of the project. 
         In February 1994, Laurel Kaleda wrote to Gwen Bell indicating that the 
         Computer Society was <br>
         agreeable to making this a joint project of the two societies. The (new) 
         steering committee will comprise Mario as Chair, an ACM-appointee as Vice 
         Chair, and six other members, three <br>
         appointed by each society. </p>
       <p> It is my hope that this project will move forward with good collaboration 
         between the two societies, that the two societies will make their appointments 
         quickly, and that the new steering committee will meet soon to review 
         what has been done to date, and either reaffirm those directions or modify 
         them </p>
