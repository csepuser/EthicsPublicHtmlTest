                   <p>
 
                     Hi Team,</p>
 
                   <p> As I was about to send this message I received Ed's email 
 
                     about Indusrty input. We have been asked to get responses 
 
                     from industry about the Code.</p>
 
                   <p> I have contacted some multi-nationals, Lockheed Martin, 
 
                     TRW etc and we are getting statements from them. If you get 
 
                     a CEO to respond then please have them indicate that they 
 
                     are a CEO on their survey form.  I think the steering committee's 
 
                     intent is to specifically identify the industry view. If the 
 
                     CEO does does not indicate their CEOness on the ballot, then 
 
                     their views are lost in the collection of all the other votes.</p>
 
                   <p>
 
                     ITS TIME TO GET BACK TO WORK :-)</p>
 
                   <p>
 
                     I have been getting responses from materials in the two magazines 
 
                     and on the web. Some of the responses are useful and others 
 
                     are not so useful. My sharing them with you does not indicate 
 
                     support of the assertions and claims made by the Here is the 
 
                     information as of November 19. I have attached a text document 
 
                     containing written
 
                     comments received on version 3.
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>The votes are in general very positive. Most are in the 90-100% 
 
                     approvalrange. Principles which received the highest negative 
 
                     votes-</p>
 
                   <p> 20-25 % opposed- were: 
 
                     1.12, - I think the issues is the SE cannot just delete data</p>
 
                   <p> 2.05, - this is just a hunch- in the ballot the phrase &quot; 
 
                     respects diversity&quot; is, in the US, a politically loaded 
 
                     phrase -This is evident by one two page critique of this clause.</p>
 
                   <p> 6.03, Many uncertain votes( rather than oppose) put this 
 
                     in the 75% range-no sure what the problem is.</p>
 
                   <p> 6.07, There is a problem with this, we might just drop it.</p>
 
                   <p> 7.02, No idea what is wrong.</p>
 
                   <p>
 
                     7.08, We need to make clear that this does not rule out appropriate 
 
                     competition. We thought the word &quot;undermine&quot; would 
 
                     carry that weight.</p>
 
                   <p>
 
                     There were some common themes that I think we need to address..*SIZE 
 
                     One of the common complaints is the size of the code. Following 
 
                     the ACM model. I suggest that we take the Eight keyword Principles 
 
                     and expand then by a word or three so that they could stand 
 
                     on their own.</p>
 
                   <p> Then we can attach the clauses under each principle as &quot;explanatory 
 
                     details&quot; &quot;guidelines&quot; &quot;specifications 
 
                     :-)&quot;- we need a good word here. The idea would be to 
 
                     be able to print the code in a short version, when necessary 
 
                     and it would still carry the sense of the whole document.</p>
 
                   <p>&nbsp; </p>
 
                   <p>Everyone</p>
 
                   <p> WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT NOW - MODIFICATIONS OF THE 8 PRINCIPLES. 
 
                     *TITLE- 
 
                     Ethics folks only want to see ethics principles and some SEs 
 
                     thought there was too much detail. Our original charge was 
 
                     to develop standards of ethics and professional practices- 
 
                     that is what we did so why not call the document: Code of Software 
 
                     Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices.</p>
 
                   <p>
 
                     TESTING VERSUS GOOD DESIGN 
 
                     Where are there places where we might balance out the emphasis 
 
                     on good testing with elements of quality design? We should 
 
                     be able to add a word or two to a clauses and add this element.</p>
 
                   <p>
 
                     THE WHOLE CODE- 
 
                     Please read through the comments (included as part of this 
 
                     document in text format) and if you agree with any of them 
 
                     then please suggest how we might modify the Code to meet the 
 
                     objections. Some of the comments may seem ludicrous to you 
 
                     and unworthy of comment. Let us just focus on those comments 
 
                     that your feel indicate a needed modification of the Code 
 
                     to produce a better Code , i.e., a clear useful document expressing 
 
                     the ethical standard and practices of a discipline aspiring 
 
                     to be a profession.
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Given the percentage of approval we ought to feel quite good 
 
                     !!!!!!! We may have identified the standards of the profession. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>My favorite feel good comment on the Code is &quot; My initial 
 
                     reaction was &quot;major overkill&quot;, but I was wrong. 
 
                     I like it! I might even call myself a software.engineer!&quot; 
 
                     I look forward top hearing from you all.
 
                   </p>

                     Revised: Nov 18 1997

                   <p>
 
                     General Comments: 
 
                     I generally favor Version 3 of Software Code of Ethics
 
                     as published in the October 1997 issue of Computer
 
                     Magazine. [3i]
 
                     This looks like a great effort and I wish you well. [14i]
 
                     My initial reaction was &quot;major overkill&quot;, but I 
 
                     was wrong. I like
 
                     it! I might even call myself a software engineer![38a]
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Three levels 
 
                     You identify three levels clearly, but why are three paragraphs 
 
                     in the preamble devoted to it? The clauses are not, as far 
 
                     as I can tell, labeled as corresponding to a particular level</p>
 
                   <p> Is the professional supposed to.decide whether what level 
 
                     a clause is, then be more insistent (demand) or less insistent 
 
                     (aspire) about doing it? (The verbage in level three includes 
 
                     &quot;aspirational,&quot; so 
 
                     makes it harder to decide how clauses should be 
 
                     classified.) Since this is e-mail rather than a 
 
                     conversation and I may not have communicated clearly, 
 
                     let me restate.</p>
 
                   <p> Devoting three paragraphs to levels tells 
 
                     me it is important to understand and apply the 
 
                     concepts, but I really can't see how to classify clauses 
 
                     or how I should view or behavior differently with 
 
                     regard to, say, a level three vs. a level one clause. [42a] 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>I agree with Leonard that these principles look very 
 
                     familiar. But I think it is very good integration of all 
 
                     ethics principles. My trouble in reading this and 
 
                     understanding it completely is primarily due to the so- 
 
                     called three-level classification of clauses: Aspire, 
 
                     Expect, and Demand. I cannot tell (with ease) which is 
 
                     which. For example, 3.03. Reject bribery. Is it 
 
                     &quot;Aspire&quot; (to be human??) or Expect (to be 
 
                     professional) or Demand (good practice)? Not sure if 
 
                     all human &quot;like&quot; to reject bribery by the very human 
 
                     nature. </p>
 
                   <p>We were &quot;taught&quot; through our education not to 
 
                     take bribery in this society. It would be a good service 
 
                     to us (educators) to label each clause one of the three 
 
                     levels if our dear authors can sort them out clearly. 
 
                     There are still some typos I guess. Otherwise I am 
 
                     excited about seeing and would love to use it in my 
 
                     course. [5i] 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Code title If reviewing this draft document, the following 
 
                     should be borne in mind: </p>
 
                   <p>(1) Principles 2-9 are largely derived from existing Code 
 
                     of Ethics from other engineering disciplines.</p>
 
                   <p> (2) We should ensure Principle 1 in particular and the other 
 
                     principles as necessary are restricted to ethical issues. 
 
                     Those that are primarily technical in nature should be eliminated. 
 
                     DG. This is contrary to the committee interest in professional 
 
                     practices Should we relabel the Code to include the word &quot;Conduct&quot; 
 
                     or &quot;Practice&quot; e.g. &quot;Software Engineering Code 
 
                     of Ethics and Professional Practice&quot;?? SIZE.I suggest 
 
                     you set a goal of reducing the code size to 40% of the draft 
 
                     size!</p>
 
                   <p>
 
                     Many of these are not ethical issues and should be deleted. 
 
                     Just because someone thinks its a good idea does not make 
 
                     it an appropriate item for a code of ethics. [22i] Too long, 
 
                     too wordy. Can't be written on the back of an envelope. [18i] 
 
                     I have no quarrel with the instant of the proposed Code of 
 
                     Ethics or the specific line items. Obviously a lot of thought 
 
                     has gone into it. </p>
 
                   <p>My comment is that it is so volumous and specific that it 
 
                     loses all its impact. If the Constitution and Bill of Rights 
 
                     were written like this they would fill 500 pages each and 
 
                     there would be 882 rights specifically delineated. </p>
 
                   <p>I would suggest that after the group reaches a consensus 
 
                     on the individual line items you give it to a writer and ask 
 
                     him/her to reduce it to a single page which summarizes each 
 
                     of the keyword principles in one or two sentences.</p>
 
                   <p> All the line items should then be put in an appendix. [17i] 
 
                     I think it was Lao Tzu who said: &quot;Where the filial son 
 
                     is highly regarded, the family is in danger. Where the loyal 
 
                     minister is regarded highly, the state is in danger.&quot; 
 
                     It seems to me that any profession that needs an ethics code 
 
                     on paper with a whopping 82 clauses of blantant obviousness, 
 
                     is in serious danger.[27a]<br>
 
                     The root of my difficulty is, I think, a philosophical one. 
 
                     I believe very strongly that codes like this have to focus 
 
                     on the &quot;spirit of the law&quot;, and not on the &quot;letter 
 
                     of the law&quot;, in order to be effective. This code has 
 
                     chosen to focus largely on the letter of the law. </p>
 
                   <p>One result is that it is five to ten times longer than it 
 
                     could be. People will be unable and/or unwilling to read it, 
 
                     remember it, and apply it. It reduces ethical principles to 
 
                     legalistic rules and seems thereby to drain the ethical juice 
 
                     right out of the concepts. These are not words that elevate 
 
                     the soul. </p>
 
                   <p>As I went through the numbered sentences, I found some that 
 
                     I violate frequently though I consider that I act ethically; 
 
                     some whose recommendations I would consider unethical; some 
 
                     that are so morally neutral that I wonder what they are doing 
 
                     in an ethics document; some that are inconsistent with other.sentences; 
 
                     some that appear to have huge loopholes; some that are ambiguous; 
 
                     and some that I just plain cannot understand the interpretation 
 
                     or intent of. By the time I was halfway through I could often 
 
                     no longer tell whether I agreed or disagreed ethically with 
 
                     any particular numbered sentence. Somewhere this Code went 
 
                     badly off the tracks.</p>
 
                   <p> I would much prefer to see a number of short, pithy, and 
 
                     inspiring statements of principle; plus perhaps one short 
 
                     &quot;in particular&quot; sentence per principle. Nothing 
 
                     further. Find one person with a keen sense of ethics and a 
 
                     winning prose style and ask them to write the Code. </p>
 
                   <p>I would take as a goal that the entire Code should be able 
 
                     to be typed comfortably on a single sheet of paper. About 
 
                     200 to 400 words. I'm sorry to have been so negative, but 
 
                     I'm afraid that is my reaction. It's not a Code of Ethics 
 
                     that I could apply in my professional life. [41a] Make it 
 
                     an SE Code.</p>
 
                   <p> There are many related practices (such as hiring practices) 
 
                     that impact our profession. But these are not unique to our 
 
                     profession. Focus more on things unique to software engineering. 
 
                     [19i] My suggestion is to reduce the list of dozens, down 
 
                     to 7 + or - 2. Focus on things like treatment of shareware 
 
                     and association with virus' that are very critical to the 
 
                     world's impression of our profession. </p>
 
                   <p>While communicating with our customers and developing good 
 
                     process is very important, it is to vague to be useful. Besides 
 
                     we have other sources for this input (like SEI). [19i] This 
 
                     code is very thorough, but it seems to focus on testing to 
 
                     remove software defects rather than designing and building 
 
                     software without defects (quality assurance). I would like 
 
                     to see an appropriate balance of software quality assurance 
 
                     testing within this code.</p>
 
                   <p>[16a] Ethics is poop Your code has delusion of scope of authority, 
 
                     that far exceeds normal work environment. Much calls for.subjective 
 
                     judgement and how will code be administered. I don't want 
 
                     more bureaucracy. Recommendation remove all instances of PC, 
 
                     goody goody , and self contradictions any statements that 
 
                     cause outrage in a segment of one professor is counter- productive. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>[15a] There is significantly too much &quot;feel good&quot;, 
 
                     &quot;save the environment&quot;, &quot;put everyone else 
 
                     before yourself&quot; in this code. I do not agree with this 
 
                     code of &quot;ethics&quot; as written. It needs to focus on 
 
                     providing competent engineers with guidelines, not maximums. 
 
                     I am interested in how this code is voted on by the members 
 
                     of the ACM so if it is not fixed, I can vote against it. [43a] 
 
                     What is the current status of the Software Engineering Body 
 
                     of Knowledge? Is the Body of Knowledge for real-time and life 
 
                     critical domain systems complete? Is the Body of Knowledge 
 
                     findings for real-time and life critical domain systems ready 
 
                     for transfer to educational program development?</p>
 
                   <p> [12a] general I dislike, in general, self-reference in a 
 
                     code of ethics and would rather see 5.09,6.02,6.03,8.06,and 
 
                     8.08 go away; but I don't feel that these are &quot;killer 
 
                     issues&quot; Other &quot;uncertain&quot; votes mostly mean 
 
                     that I found the wording rather empty or unenforceable. </p>
 
                   <p>[28a] My initial reaction was &quot;major overkill&quot;, 
 
                     but I was wrong. I like it! I might even call myself a software 
 
                     engineer![38a]</p>
 
                   <p> 1. Products Principle 1: PRODUCT. <br>
 
                     Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, ensure that 
 
                     the software on which they work is useful and of acceptable 
 
                     quality to the public, the employer, the client, and the user; 
 
                     completed on time and at reasonable cost; and free of error. 
 
                     In.particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate: I'd 
 
                     add an additional clause: * Refuse to work for or approve 
 
                     projects where the working conditions under which the project 
 
                     was produced are, in the engineer's opinion, likely to lead 
 
                     to unacceptably high risks to the public or the client's safe 
 
                     and effective use of the software.</p>
 
                   <p>[40a] I am not clear on the differences between these four 
 
                     groups. Perhaps a simple scenario would be helpful as a footnote 
 
                     or in the preamble. The employer pays for and directs your 
 
                     work. The client commissions the work. The user uses the work. 
 
                     The public are those not directly involved. Suppose a bank 
 
                     hires the software firm you work for to develop a program 
 
                     for tellers. The bank is the client. The software firm is 
 
                     the employer. A teller is a user (or is the person seeing 
 
                     the teller a user, too?). The public includes the person do 
 
                     banking with the teller, accountants, competitors, and the 
 
                     rest of humanity.</p>
 
                   <p> Defining and using terms consistently is an important part 
 
                     of a code. Otherwise, how can we talk about the same thing?

                     covers it better.[13a] 1.01 and 1.02 The very best software 
 
                     always has this in common: it seems to &quot;understand&quot;

                     fully qualified [13a] for many projects, employers must educate 
 
                     employees on the project because information isn't widely 
 
                     available. Not sure of exact syntax but it should note that 
 
                     on-the-job-training or employer- provided education is one 
 
                     way of meeting this requirement.<br>
 
                     [40a] We all expect to do some learning on at least some jobs.

                     the Therac-25 software unqualified or just did a poor job? 
 
                     Can we expect software engineers to know their limitations

                   <p>If someone approached me to write an accounting package, 
 
                     I'd probably feel comfortable accepting as long as I inform 
 
                     them that I needed specifications to include proper accounting 
 
                     practices and audits since I have little training or experience 
 
                     in that area. A side comment: some clauses, such as 1.01 and 
 
                     1.02, refer to &quot;software on which they work&quot; while 
 
                     other clauses, such as 1.03 and 1.04, refer to &quot;project 
 
                     on which they work.&quot; If there is little or no distinction, 
 
                     the code should only use one term consistently. If there is 
 
                     a distinction, perhaps it could be mentioned. (It looks like 
 
                     I'm suggesting a glossary of sorts.) </p>
 
                   <p>[42a] 1.04. Ensure proper and achievable goals and objectives 
 
                     for any project on which they work or propose. 1.04 thru 1.09 
 
                     Items 1.04 thru 1.09 are legitimate things to go into a code 
 
                     of ethics, but they're in the wrong place. They all pertain 
 
                     to management or project management, not to the person working 
 
                     on the project. As a software engineer, programmer, or whatever, 
 
                     I can't control wether the goals are proper and.achievable, 
 
                     etc. What I can, and should do, is discuss it with my management 
 
                     and project management to make sure they know my concerns. 
 
                     <br>

                     to convince them, but it's their decision. Given the reality 
 
                     of being employed, rather then being self-employed, that's 
 
                     about the limit, unless I perceive it as something worth losing 
 
                     my job over. [11i] 1.04 thru 1.08 Too vague for members of

                     on which they work or propose to work. 1.05&amp;1.06 These 
 
                     are generally management concerns over which the working S.E. 
 
                     may have little control. Better words might be educated, propose, 
 
                     inform management if these are not followed. [9i] 1.05: add: 
 
                     except with the knowledge and consent of all parties.[27a] 
 
                     In doing really innovative, leading edge work, &quot;methodology&quot; 
 
                     may yet need to be invented] With the general lack of widely 
 
                     accepted methodologies, I would feel more comfortable with 
 
                     &quot;adequate.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p>[42a] 1.06. Ensure good management for any project on which 
 
                     they work, including effective procedures for promotion of 
 
                     quality and reduction of risk 1.06 I am in favor of supporting 
 
                     good management, but uncertain also supporting this wording. 
 
                     Beginning software engineers work under existing management; 
 
                     it seems presumptuous to assume that they can realistically 
 
                     expect, cause, or require good management in every project 
 
                     they work on. I would support this if re-worded to say any 
 
                     project they manage or participate in the management. [2i].</p>
 
                   <p>One area many &quot;new&quot; software engineers tend to 
 
                     ignore, or not think about is proper Configuration Management 
 
                     (this includes software and documentation). It is essential 
 
                     part of any good, properly run software project and becomes 
 
                     critical once the project has been released. You might want 
 
                     to add that to this paragraph: Ensure good management for 
 
                     any project on which they work, including effective procedures 
 
                     for promotion of quality, configuration management, and reduction 
 
                     of risk.</p>
 
                   <p> [23i] Controlling management seems beyond the authority 
 
                     of the managed. If this were moved into the Management section, 
 
                     and applied to the manager, it makes sense. Otherwise, I strongly 
 
                     disagree.</p>
 
                   <p>[27a] Is this directed primarily to managers, or should everyone 
 
                     be expected to campaign against poor management they may be 
 
                     subject to? Unless the professional has input into management, 
 
                     I think going beyond reporting possible risks is too much 
 
                     to expect. Besides, there is a whole principle for management 
 
                     [42a] 1.06 and 1.07 I oppose these clauses due to their unenforcability. 
 
                     Management and estimates are often outside the control of 
 
                     the software professional. I have done estimate numerous times 
 
                     only to see them chopped by management unconcerned with the 
 
                     issues. </p>
 
                   <p>[43a] 1.07. Ensure realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, 
 
                     personnel, and outcome on any project on which they work or 
 
                     propose to work and provide a risk assessment of these estimates 
 
                     1.07 Although your 1.07 is similar, the wording of item 3 
 
                     of the Swedish code is very nice and perhaps might suggest 
 
                     some adjustment in your statements/ I treads: &quot;only take 
 
                     part in projects with the time and resources assigned to make 
 
                     it possible to do a good job.&quot; (Swedish Ethical Rules 
 
                     for Computer Professionals 91) [4i] Again, this seems like 
 
                     management's job. If the word &quot;Ensure&quot; were changed 
 
                     to &quot;Provide&quot;, then I'm happy with it. Otherwise, 
 
                     I strongly disagree.</p>
 
                   <p>[27a] 1.08. Ensure adequate documentation on any project 
 
                     on which they work, including a log of problems discovered 
 
                     and solutions adopted. 1.08 Scratch the log requirement unless 
 
                     customer specified [13a] 1.08 - You can not force documentation 
 
                     and you specifically state at least one form of documentations 
 
                     her (problem/solution logs). [43a] If a problem has been solved, 
 
                     why should it be explicitly documented? How about &quot;including 
 
                     a list of resolved problems and any possible solutions or 
 
                     ways to avoid them&quot;?</p>
 
                   <p>[42a] 1.09. Ensure adequate testing, debugging, and review 
 
                     of software and related documents on which they work. 1.09 
 
                     Ensure adequate testing and debugging is partly the responsibility 
 
                     of the product provider but more so, the responsibility of 
 
                     those purchasing the product.</p>
 
                   <p>[31a] 1.10. Work to develop software and related documents 
 
                     that respect the privacy of those who will be subjected to 
 
                     that software. Are these the clients mentioned earlier? Or 
 
                     the users? Or the public? (&quot;subjected&quot; is a very 
 
                     emotionally charged word.) I don't see how software documentation 
 
                     can possibly violate someone's privacy (unless they are used 
 
                     as an example in a training manual.) How about Ensure that 
 
                     the software respects.the privacy all concerned </p>
 
                   <p>[42a] 1.11. Be careful to use only accurate data derived 
 
                     from legal sources, and use only in ways properly authorized. 
 
                     I'd like to see &quot;ethical&quot; in addition to &quot;legal.&quot; 
 
                     Some things may not be against the law, but not be ethical. 
 
                     In fact, much data collection today is legal, but invades 
 
                     the privacy of the public. Should this be broadened to cover 
 
                     operating legally? For instance, a patented algorithm may 
 
                     be used illegally and it only very loosely can be considered 
 
                     not in the spirit of 1.11 since it refers to data. </p>
 
                   <p>[42a] 1.12. Whenever appropriate, delete outdated or flawed 
 
                     data 1.12 I don't agree with the presence of this statement 
 
                     in a Software Engineering Code of Ethics. First, with respect 
 
                     to the data, flawed or outdated data can still be meaningful 
 
                     in other contexts. Second, although it is tempered with the 
 
                     &quot; where appropriate&quot; clause, the action of the statement 
 
                     has a direct impact on the data and the places the Software 
 
                     Engineer in a precarious position. </p>
 
                   <p>Data are the persistent artifacts of the applications. Generally, 
 
                     the user of the software or other individual should be the 
 
                     stewart of the data content, not the Software Engineer. Finally, 
 
                     if a statement regarding data quality is to appear in the 
 
                     Code of Ethics, it should place the Software Engineer in an 
 
                     advisory role to the stewart of the data, not in the role 
 
                     to act upon the data. </p>
 
                   <p>
 
                     A more acceptable statement would be something like: &quot;Promote 
 
                     understanding and awareness of the quality of the data management 
 
                     issues that surround the data that affect the product.&quot; 
 
                     [10i] Not (?)thin scope of control. [21a] &quot;Delete&quot;? 
 
                     How about &quot;remove to archive or delete&quot; [13a] If 
 
                     the word &quot;delete&quot; is changed to &quot;delete, mark 
 
                     or report as invalid,&quot;.then this makes sense. Otherwise, 
 
                     it calls on the employee to delete data that belongs to the 
 
                     employer, and over which he may not have authority. Maybe 
 
                     this is covered by &quot;whenever appropriate.&quot;[27a] 
 
                     It may be adequate even preferable to flag outdated or flawed 
 
                     dada so that we don't lore history. Suggest &quot;... delete 
 
                     or clearly label outdated or ...&quot;[28a] Modify and evaluate. 
 
                     Maybe store if required later. [29a] Agree if there is a very 
 
                     strict process in place to determine which is outdated and 
 
                     flawed.</p>
 
                   <p> [36i]. 1.12 - Your outdated data might be my regression 
 
                     test data to keep a 10 year old program running. Deleting 
 
                     bad data is good. [43a] Possibly 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12 should 
 
                     be combined to say data should be obtained, maintained, and 
 
                     used legally, ethically, and accurately.</p>
 
                   <p> [42a] 1.13. Work to identify, define and address ethical, 
 
                     economic, cultural, legal, and environmental issues related 
 
                     to any work project. 1.13 Do not insist that computer professional 
 
                     should be &quot;out in front&quot;. Remember that some people 
 
                     who really should have know better ridiculed the publicity 
 
                     than when its invention was announced. Social issues are even 
 
                     more treacherous [34a] 1.13 - Please delete this &quot;feel

                     stuff. If an individual want to support these goals that is 
 
                     different than saying an entire profession must. </p>
 
                   <p>[43a] 1.14. Promote maximum quality and minimum cost to the 
 
                     employer, the client, the user and the public. Make any tradeoffs 
 
                     clear to all parties concerned. 1.14 I oppose the last sentence: 
 
                     &quot;Make any tradeoffs clear.to all parties concerned.&quot; 
 
                     This is over-specification, and to detailed . Almost every 
 
                     design and implementation decision has quality and cost implications 
 
                     and involves tradeoffs between cost and quality. Yet one certainly 
 
                     does not want to make all these tradeoffs clear to all the 
 
                     parties involved -- nor would they want it.</p>
 
                   <p> Eliminate this, or quantify with &quot;important&quot;, 
 
                     &quot;major&quot;, &quot;significant&quot; or other similar 
 
                     terms. [2i] 1.14 &amp; 1.15 - While neutral, I prefer max 
 
                     quality, max profit. Why hasn't Bill Gates lowered the basic 
 
                     price of Win95? He doesn't have to. makes me angry but he 
 
                     would fail 1.14. I find &quot;follow industry standards to 
 
                     be nebulous given the only real standards are ANSI/ISO for 
 
                     code and compilers. DoD Standards don't (and shouldn't) apply 
 
                     to everyone. [43a] Should I make any tradeoffs clear to the 
 
                     public? Does that mean that everyone at Microsoft (and most 
 
                     of the rest of the industry) is acting unethically because 
 
                     they don't make it clear to the public that quality is being 
 
                     traded off for profit and features? The public generally believes 
 
                     that better quality is unattainable, even though everyone 
 
                     is sick of crashing programs.</p>
 
                   <p> [42a] 1.15. Work to follow industry standards that are most 
 
                     appropriate for the task at hand, departing from these only 
 
                     when technically justified 1.15 I oppose this statement because 
 
                     of the words &quot; departing from these only when technically 
 
                     justified.&quot; There may be other equally valid non- technical 
 
                     reasons for deviating from industry standards; cost or economic 
 
                     standards being one example, and government or other public 
 
                     policy issues or concerns another. Either drop the word &quot;technically&quot; 
 
                     (preferred) or add &quot;economically or otherwise&quot;. 
 
                     [2i] Too restrictive. [21a] Maybe to vague. </p>

                     the environment, that they reasonably believe to be associated 
 
                     with software or related documents for which they are responsible, 
 
                     or merely know about. 2.01 The wording &quot; merely know 
 
                     about&quot; implies a very weak position and should be removed. 
 
                     [9i] Maybe it is just the phrasing of the statement , but 
 
                     I would strike the final phrase (&quot;merely know about&quot;) 
 
                     from this statement. I also would strike &quot;actual or potential&quot;. 
 
                     With these corrections, I would have responded &quot;Favor&quot; 
 
                     to this item on the survey.[10i] 2.01 &amp; 2.02 - Please 
 
                     remove &quot;environment&quot; references. [43a] Where did

                   </p>
 
                   <p>[42a] 2.02. Approve software only if they have a well-founded 
 
                     belief that it is safe, meets specifications, has passed appropriate 
 
                     tests, and does not diminish quality of life or harm the environment. 
 
                     2.02 Item 2.02 of the ACM/IEEE proposed code of ethics states 
 
                     &quot;Approve software only if ... [it] does not .... harm 
 
                     the environment.&quot; As I read it, this seems to declare 
 
                     unethical virtually any piece of software related to civil 
 
                     engineering. Fir example, suppose some one wanted to build 
 
                     a road. </p>
 
                   <p>The construction of the road could damage the environment 
 
                     by being built in a wetland or other environmentally sensitive 
 
                     area. Any software used in building the road would thus contribute 
 
                     to damage the environment. Software used to help design dams 
 
                     is another case where the clear result of civil engineering 
 
                     software is damage to the.environment. </p>
 
                   <p>I doubt it is the intention of the code of ethics to declare 
 
                     unethical the development of most civil engineering software 
 
                     but I think it does just that. [26a] Get real. Complex products 
 
                     are released before all tests pass when prudent risk says 
 
                     probability of catastrophe is acceptably low ~ typically with 
 
                     hundreds of unresolved problem reports.</p>

                     How about &quot;Sign or affirm&quot;? 4.02 uses the more general

                     Issues of language, different abilities, physical access,

                     should all be considered 2.05 I favor respecting diversity, 
 
                     however there is a segment of society that want to go overboard. 
 
                     I don't object to current.wording but don't go any further. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>[1i] It is my opinion that diversity is a method of (?)Bathhazing(?) 
 
                     the country, of dividing us into groups for the purpose of 
 
                     creating and consolidating political power, especially on 
 
                     the left. It is a classic use of the principle of divide and 
 
                     conquer. The specific text of clause 2.05 contains a puzzling 
 
                     term &quot; mental access,&quot; as opposed to (?) Or (?) 
 
                     physical access.&quot; What does that mean? Does that mean 
 
                     the ability to access computers by people whose mental abilities 
 
                     are less than normal? </p>
 
                   <p>The only way to know of (?)doing(?) Is to (?)&quot;dumbdown&quot; 
 
                     (?) The user interface. I will not for example attempt to 
 
                     create a word processor that the illiterate could use. [8i] 
 
                     Will this increase cost/time against or beyond specifications? 
 
                     [9i] I wish this could be worded to include &quot;sensory 
 
                     access&quot; or &quot;sensory abilities&quot;. I have to read 
 
                     very broadly to understand that 2.05 includes the needs of 
 
                     the visually impaired and the hearing impaired.</p>
 
                   <p> With the current technologies we should be able to design 
 
                     for all sensory anomalies. [14i] I think this should be qualified 
 
                     by stating &quot; where reasonable&quot;. I agree that coders 
 
                     should endeavor to do this but many situations exist where 
 
                     this is not needed. How far do they go? [20a] PC has nothing 
 
                     to do with ethics.[15a] Targeting the audience of software 
 
                     users should be more of a concern/goal than trying to attack 
 
                     world-hunger with each software produced...it's a bit too 
 
                     forward looking [31a] The wording of principle 2 and clause 
 
                     2,05, as compared to principle 1, make it appear to me that 
 
                     supporting diversity is more important than producing a product 
 
                     which meets design specifications. </p>
 
                   <p>Diversity requirements should be addressed in the specifications 
 
                     and the software engineer should not arbitrarily increase 
 
                     the scope of the work. I would prefer the language to be similar 
 
                     to &quot;Endeavor to produce software that is usable by all 
 
                     members of the target group.&quot; All software is.designed 
 
                     for some subset of the human race. To attempt to design software 
 
                     usable by everyone is simply not practical.</p>
 
                   <p> [35i] 2.05 - Completely unnecessary. If I want to sell worldwide 
 
                     I should take internationalization into account. If I want 
 
                     to write software for middle-age white males I should be allowed 
 
                     to do so with out breaking a code of ethics [43a] The only 
 
                     portion of your proposal with which I have any real trouble 
 
                     is subsection 2.05. I understand the temptation to include 
 
                     politically correct verbiage, but I object to the clause, 
 
                     especially the phrase &quot;respect diversity&quot;. </p>
 
                   <p>I'm sure Hillary Clinton would applaud this portion, but 
 
                     I find it unacceptable, for the following reasons: </p>
 
                   <blockquote> 
 
                     <p>1. It's vague. <br>
 
                       As an example, some computer programs help insurance companies 
 
                       set prices for policies, sometimes based on where people 
 
                       live. This results in people living in high-crime areas 
 
                       paying higher rates or being denied policies. Statistically, 
 
                       these people are disproportionately minorities. </p>
 
                     <p>If I work with a client on a project to develop such software, 
 
                       have I violated this subsection? Surely some people who 
 
                       have spoken out against this so-called &quot;red-lining&quot; 
 
                       would say I have. However, if insurance companies have the 
 
                       legal right--perhaps even a fiduciary responsibility to 
 
                       their shareholders--to sell policies based on established 
 
                       risk factors, isn't it in society's interest that the best 
 
                       possible software engineers work on such systems? </p>
 
                     <p>2. It's contradictory.<br>
 
                       I am currently working with a client whose product provides 
 
                       dating-related services over the phone, both for purposes 
 
                       of long-term relationships and simple sexual gratification, 
 
                       some of it homosexual. Being a libertarian, this does not 
 
                       concern me. However, if I were an employee at a contract 
 
                       software firm, and my religious faith condemned premarital 
 
                       and homosexual sex, would I fail to &quot;respect diversity&quot; 
 
                       by refusing to work on such a project, or would my employer 
 
                       fail to &quot;respect diversity&quot; by insisting that 
 
                       I do such work or be fired?</p>
 
                     <p> 3. It's pointless. <br>
 
                       Any software engineer who works on games such as those &quot;Nazi 
 
                       death camp&quot; ones so widely reported not too long ago 
 
                       could hardly be expected to trouble his head much with a 
 
                       code of ethics, yes? In.other words, the hardcore &quot;diversity 
 
                       disrespectors&quot; won't care about this clause. Those 
 
                       of us who will care, already do care.</p>
 
                     <p> 4. It's dangerous. <br>
 
                       Recent history abounds with instances of companies and individuals 
 
                       who were branded by the spokesfolks of the politically correct 
 
                       as people who failed to &quot;respect diversity&quot;--the 
 
                       usual words were &quot;bigots&quot;, &quot;racists&quot;, 
 
                       &quot;homophobes&quot;, etc. In some cases, facts emerged 
 
                       to debunk the charges, but by then the demogogues coordinating 
 
                       the public tarring and feathering of the allegedly insensitive 
 
                       entity had built up such a head of steam that not even the 
 
                       truth could stop the stampede. Just by being a white male, 
 
                       my odds of being the guest of dishonor in such an incident 
 
                       are unfairly high. I can ill-afford a code of ethics that 
 
                       exposes me to further ignominy at the hands of some self-appointed 
 
                       protector of some self-designated oppressed element of society. 
 
                       Careers have been ruined this way, in some cases most unfairly. 
 
                     </p>
 
                     <p>5. It's unnecessary. I believe other portions of the code 
 
                       adequately address participating in or abetting an illegal 
 
                       act of discrimination or a hate crime. Issues like discrimination, 
 
                       racism, lifestyle-choice rights, and immigration are highly-charged 
 
                       social questions that are both morally complex and rapidly 
 
                       evolving. In my opinion, guidance on these matters is beyond 
 
                       the scope of a professional code of ethics, and surely beyond 
 
                       the scope of two short sentences. </p>
 
                     <p>In Stalinist Russia, few examples so capture the fallacy 
 
                       and stupidity of socialism as &quot;Socialist Science&quot;. 
 
                       Scientists bent their knees to the Communist Party and its 
 
                       tyrants, pursuing all sorts of ridiculous theories because 
 
                       they met with the approval of the Soviet hierarchy, turning 
 
                       their backs on the truth. I don't want to suggest that this 
 
                       subsection is on the scale of that grotesquely, but I do 
 
                       want to point out a parallel: All science must be ethically 
 
                       and morally informed, but it must not take sides in political 
 
                       matters. </p>
 
                     <p>Of course, I grant anyone the right to view respecting 
 
                       diversity, however one defines it, as a pillar of one's 
 
                       personal ethics; however, I ask that this code not make 
 
                       it a mandatory part of the ethical values of every software 
 
                       engineer. [39a] Today &quot;diversity&quot; is used to cover 
 
                       approval of actions with which I strongly disagree. </p>

                     statement is too ambitious when it promotes public interest 
 
                     ahead of that of the employer. If the Software Engineer has 
 
                     adequately &quot;prequalified&quot; the employer or client 
 
                     and determined that the employer or client is not actively

                     is the responsibility of the Software Engineer to advise the 
 
                     employer or client regarding any concerns relatively to the 
 
                     interest of the public at large. In this manner, the Software 
 
                     Engineer can play the role of educating those with the ability

                     &quot;third party to a contract&quot; seems odd. I think it 
 
                     should be &quot;party outside the contract&quot; since I'm

                     &quot;Do not accept&quot; could be changed to indicate a positive 
 
                     statement of clearly defining where and how all payments are 
 
                     expected. A work of software for sale implies many future 
 
                     payments. [9i] Too vague.[21a] Why is this phrased differently? 
 
                     &quot;when the circumstances have been fully disclosed to

                   <p> [1i] I am concerned with the way this is worded, which seems 
 
                     to preclude opposing my employer on anything without company 
 
                     approval. If my company wants to expand a plant and I as a 
 
                     taxpayer of the city involved oppose this because it would 
 
                     be a zoning violation, increase traffic, etc. I should fill

                     to sell a software package to the local school district and 
 
                     I think another package would.be better. As a taxpayer, I 
 
                     want to provide such input - and not at the whim of my employer.</p>
 
                   <p> I can always make clear that I speak for myself, not my 
 
                     employer. [2i] I have some trouble with the wording of 3.07, 
 
                     Avoiding conflicting financail interests. As wprded it seems 
 
                     overly broad in one sense ant to narrow in another. I realize 
 
                     that it is just as important to avoid an impression of conflict 
 
                     of interest. However, being engineers we are sometimes called 
 
                     upon by all concerned to render an opinion or vote on a subject. 
 
                     Need we avoid giving opinions when we feel we can be fair 
 
                     and impartial to all concerned? I marked 3.07 as uncertain. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Perhaps 3.07 could reference 3.06 to help expose conflicts 
 
                     to all concerned. If approved, an opinion could still be rendered. 
 
                     Perhaps 3.07 could be more like the simple four word definition.[3i] 
 
                     I may participate. However, I must disclose the conflicts 
 
                     before participation and clearly state. [9i] The verb &quot;refuse&quot; 
 
                     is too strong. Also, restricting the statement to &quot;financial 
 
                     interest&quot; likely misses other important &quot;interests.&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>A Software Engineer with an interest should fully disclose

                     of the participation of the Software Engineer in the decision 
 
                     process can be made and acted on accordingly. [10i] I disagree

                       in the subject- financial and otherwise - and let the other

                     it may be implied by the current wording of 5.03, it might

                     This seems to say that the software engineer's commitment

                     While I am not prepared to generate a big argument about this, 
 
                     it somehow bothers me. A minor point is that, for many parts 
 
                     of the code, there might not be any &quot;appropriate authorities&quot; 
 
                     to report to. Perhaps more basic is a vague distaste with

                     any &quot;appropriate authorities.&quot; There would have

                     Many companies have policies regarding the sharing of salary 
 
                     information. This places the engineer on unequal footing with

                     better then the law and the SE would somehow have the capacity 
 
                     to know this. How? [9i].says &quot;obey all laws, unless you 
 
                     don't want to&quot; unacceptable.[15a] This says that a professional 
 
                     must place their own judgment above obedience to the law. 
 
                     Granted this must occur in extreme cases, but this clause 
 
                     is much too strong. Perhaps just &quot;Obey all laws governing 
 
                     their work&quot; is enough, and let general statements such 
 
                     as &quot;standards may conflict with each other&quot; and 
 
                     &quot;consistent with public health, safety, and welfare&quot;

                   <p>After all, we don't tack the clause onto 5.02, 5.06, 6.01,

                     obedience to the law even if it may occasionally be contrary 
 
                     to what we perceive as public health, safety, and welfare. 
 
                     A lawless society is a much greater danger than laws requiring 
 
                     one to harm public health, safety, and welfare. How about 
 
                     a clause about working to improve or enact laws to bring about 
 
                     a legal environment conducive to the good development and 
 
                     use of software?</p>

                     It seems perfectly reasonable to me for someone paying for

                     clause is not consistent with text (at least outside of academia!!!)[38a] 
 
                     Suppose I am competing with another SE for a job which could 
 
                     use a lot of C++ experience. If I have a lot more experience 
 
                     than she does, I don't see the problem with pointing out my 
 
                     greater experience to improve my chances of getting the job 
 
                     (personal gain) and lessening hers (undermining her job prospects). 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>How about something like &quot;Not undermine with false, 
 
                     distorted, or irrelevant information another SE's job prospects 
 
                     ...&quot;? </p>
 
                   <p>[42a] 7.09. In situations outside of their own areas of competence, 
 
                     call upon the opinions of other professionals who have competence 
 
                     in that area.</p>

                   <p>Software engineers shall, throughout their career, strive 
 
                     to enhance their own ability to practice their profession 
 
                     as it should be practiced. In particular, software engineers 
 
                     shall continually endeavor to:</p>
 
                   <p> 8.01. Further their knowledge of developments in the analysis, 
 
                     design, development, and testing of software and related documents, 
 
                     together with the management of the development process.</p>
 
                   <p> 8.01 I think &quot;specification&quot; should be added to 
 
                     clause 8.01's ;1ST of areas inn which we should further our 
 
                     knowledge, ahead of &quot;design, development and testing.&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>[26a].8.02. Improve their ability to create safe, reliable, 
 
                     and useful quality software at reasonable cost and within 
 
                     a reasonable time. </p>
 
                   <p>8.03. Improve their ability to write accurate, informative, 
 
                     and literate documents in support of software on which they 
 
                     work. </p>
 
                   <p>8.03 I am not sure if we (SE's) should document work or if 
 
                     we should engage a professional like technical writer to document 
 
                     the outcome. We might ensure adequate documention is available. 
 
                     Who does it is another issue. </p>
 
                   <p>[9i] 8.04. Improve their understanding of the software and 
 
                     related documents on which they work and of the environment 
 
                     in which they will be used. 8.04 To what purpose other than 
 
                     to enhance abilities to create other products. If so then 
 
                     is it not just repeating concepts? </p>
 
                   <p>[9i] 8.05. Improve their knowledge of the law governing the 
 
                     software and related documents on which they work. </p>
 
                   <p>8.05 50 states with their own regulations, and Federal , 
 
                     too? This is a bit much to dump on computer professionals. 
 
                     Lawmakers need to help out with disseminating statutory information 
 
                     and/or standardizing the statutes so here is less to disseminate.</p>
 
                   <p>[34a] 8.06. Improve their knowledge of this code, its interpretation, 
 
                     and its application to their work. </p>
 
                   <p>8.07. Refrain from requiring or influencing others to undertake 
 
                     any action which involves a breach of this code.</p>
 
                   <p> 8.07. Refrain from requiring or influencing others to undertake.any 
 
                     action which involves a breach of this code. 8.07 too busy. 
 
                     [21a] &quot;Influencing&quot; should be strong enough; &quot;requiring&quot; 
 
                     is not necessary. Significantly overlaps 5.09.</p>
 
                   <p>[42a] 8.08. Consider violations of this code inconsistent 
 
                     with being a professional software engineer and encourage 
 
                     colleagues to adhere to this code. 8.08 too subjective </p>
 
                   <p>[21a] 8.08 While I believe this is appropriate the contents 
 
                     of this code would keep me from promoting it in its current 
 
                     form.[43a] </p>
