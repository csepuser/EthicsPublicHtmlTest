       <p>&quot;2000 Problem Tests Professionalism of Programmers.&quot; <em>New
           York Times </em> May 3, 1999 pgs. C1.</p>
       <p>By ANDREW POLLACK</p>
       <p>It is spelled out, right there in the code of ethics of the Association
         for Computing Machinery, one of the world's oldest and largest computer
         professional societies: &quot;An essential aim of computer professionals
         is to minimize negative consequences of computer systems, including threats
         to health and safety.&quot;</p>
       <p>Computer professionals. the code continues, should warn their bosses
         about any such threats and even blow the whistle if their superiors ignore
         them.</p>
       <p>So why didn't all those computer professionals do the ethical thing
         and prevent or blow the whistle on the year 2000 computer problem ?a
         glitch that some experts warn could cause such threats to health and
         safety as malfunctioning medical equipment and wayward airplanes when
         the clock ticks over to Jan. 1, 2000&quot;</p>
       <p>Just how much programmers and their managers should be faulted for this
         problem -- which, after all, was decades in the making -- is but one
         question being raised about a profession that usually labors in obscurity
         but plays an increasingly vital role in society.</p>
       <p>Some experts say the year 2000 problem could lead to changes in the
         way programs are written, just as earthquakes can lead to stricter building
         codes. Moreover, Y2K, as the problem is known, has given</p>
       <p> <br>
   new life to a debate about whether programmers should be required to obtain
     professional certification, similar to that required of doctors, lawyers
     and certain engineers.</p>
       <p>&quot;You don't want an unlicensed engineer working on a bridge, but
         you have unlicensed computer programmers working all the time,&quot; said
         Dr. Marsha C. Woodbury. chairwoman of Computer Professionals for Social
         Responsibility, an 1,800?member group that deals with social consequences
         of computing.</p>
       <p>Any pressure for change could evaporate, of course, depending on the
         extent of computing problems that occur after the stroke of midnight
         on Dec. 31. That is when millions of computers could fail to recognize
         that the two?digit year date &quot;00&quot; means 201)(1 and not 1900.
         But if colossal disasters ensue, many experts say that the public may
         demand that the Government step in, perhaps by regulating programmers.</p>
       <p>Even now, well before New Year's, many computing professionals see the
         close of an era.</p>
       <p>&quot;This is the end of 5tl years of infatuation and unconstrained
         trust in what information technologists can deliver,&quot; said Paul
         A. Strassmann, a former chief information officer for the Defense Department
         and the Xerox Corporation.</p>
       <p>As Strassmann notes. the Government has already stepped in, as</p>
       <p> <br>
   children. The cause was a faulty regulator on a gas steam heater. Nowadays,
     Speed said, the function performed by that mechanical device would be handled
     by software.</p>
       <p>Elsewhere. the idea of licensing or certifying computer programmers
         has Ionbeen discussed but never put in place. mainly because programmers
         are in huge demand and many of the best do not have formal training?
         or education.</p>
       <p>In any event, some experts say it is not clear that certification would
         have prevented the year 1000 problem.</p>
       <p>The problem had its genesis in the I 950's and 1960's, when using two
         digits instead of four to represent the year in programming could save
         precious and expensive computer memory. It was assumed that the programs
         would all be replaced by the year 2000. If anything, some computer professionals
         say. the millennium bug is a testament to how well programmers did their
         jobs, not how poorly.</p>
       <p>&quot;The software was so adaptable it lasted all these years, so we
         didn't have to retire it,&quot; said Tom DeMarco, a programmer, author
         and consultant in Maine. &quot;Our undoing was we did it so much better
         than we thought we would.&quot;</p>
       <p>Certainly, very few programmers feel pangs of conscience in the way
         that some nuclear physicists rue having brought the world the Bomb. A
         few programmers who say they did sound the alarm way back contend that
         they were ignored by corporate management. Younger programmers see the
         problem as one caused by their predecessors, bearing no reflection on
         them.</p>
       <p>Donald Gotterbarn, director at the Software Engineering Ethics Institute
         at East Tennessee State University, said the year 2000 problem resulted
         from &quot;lack of foresight and bad guesses,&quot; not from ethical
         lapses.</p>
       <p>Where he sees mere mistakes, though, other experts say</p>
       <p> <br>
   the problem was a design flaw that could, and should, have been prevented --
     especially since the two?digit practice continued into the 1990's, long after
     computer memory had become cheap and plentiful.</p>
       <p>&quot;I would hope we see it for what it is -- we've made a giant quality
         mistake here,&quot; said Leon A. Kappelman, an associate professor of
         business computer information systems at the University of North Texas
         and co?chairman of the Society for Information Management's Year 2000
         working group.</p>
       <p>&quot;It would seem our code of ethics would tell us we shouldn't have
         done that,&quot; Dr. Kappelman added. &quot;and once we did it we should
         have been more proactive.&quot; But the code of ethics of the Association
         for Computing Machinery, which has 80,000 members in more than 100 countries,
         has no force behind it. And most programmers probably are not even aware
         it exists.</p>
       <p>As Dr. Woodbury of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
         put it: &quot;Although computer science departments are supposed to teach
         ethics along with programming. it's extremely unpopular.</p>
       <p>People like me find ourselves isolated and even laughed at.&quot;</p>
       <p>That could change. The Association for Computing Machinery, in league
         with the 100,000?member Computer Society of the Institute of Electrical
         and Electronic Engineers, adopted a new software engineering ethics code
         late last year. The code calls for programmers to act in the public interest
         and to &quot;promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession,&quot; among
         other measures.</p>
       <p>Just who is responsible for the year 2000 glitch could become a legal
         as well as an ethical question if. as expected, computer problems lead
         to widespread lawsuits. A wide swath of corporate America, including
         the computer industry, is backing legislation in Congress that would
         limit such lawsuits and liability. Last week the Senate at least temporarily
         shelved the bill, which had become entangled by a number of other. partisan
         disputes.</p>
       <p>But the bill itself has many critics, who see it as an industry attempt
         to escape responsibility for poor product design. &quot;It's get?out?of?jail?free
         cards,&quot; Dr.</p>

       <p> <br>
   Kappelman said.</p>
       <p>Within corporations, the year 2000 problem has placed new scrutiny on
         chief information officers. Some have been criticized for not preventing
         the costly problem. But top management's greater attention to computer
         operations can only be good in the long run, some say.</p>
       <p><br>
 &quot;Technology was just something that happened behind closed doors and now
 those doors are opened more,&quot; said Lauris Nance, chief information officer
 of the Public Service Company of North Carolina, a gas utility. &quot;There's
 a general better appreciation of the technical staff.&quot; Ms. Nance herself
 has received several promotions for seizing upon the problem early.</p>
       <p>Strassmann, the former Pentagon technology official, predicts that corporate
         chief information officers may one day be given fiduciary responsibility
         that makes them legally accountable for computing operations.</p>
       <p>Increased pressure on the information chiefs is leading to change within
         corporate computing departments. When first confronted a few years ago
         with the need to check and fix all their programs, many computer departments
         were not even sure what and how many programs their machines were running.
         Even when they were identified, many programs lacked documentation --
         the textual commentaries that are supposed to let a subsequent programmer
         follow what the author of the software was trying to accomplish.</p>
       <p>&quot;Before. you had a lot of people fight you about documentation
         and stuff,&quot; Ms. Nance said. Now, she said, programmers meet more
         often as teams, and the company uses outside auditors to help assess
         the risk of new technology projects.</p>
       <p>Whatever changes the year 2000 problem has meant for companies that
         use and maintain software, it has placed new performance pressures on
         companies that create software. A question in some pending lawsuits is
         whether vendors are responsible for fixing software they sold that is
         not ready for the year 2000. The need for lawyers to bone upon software
         issues has effectively created a new bar that will be in position to
         handle software liability</p>
       <p> <br>
   suits. even those unrelated to year _2000.</p>
       <p>&quot;Future contracts are going to have much tighter provisions about
         vendor responsibility for unforeseen events.&quot; said Jim Jones. manager
         of the year 2000 program at the Information Management Forum. an organization
         of information technology executive,from large companies and government
         agencies.</p>
       <p>Meanwhile. for many programmers. long stereotyped ,antisocial nerds.
         the ethics debate has thrust them into an uncharacteristically visible
         role.</p>
       <p>&quot;I don't know if we're going to be the heroes, or the goats of
         1999.&quot; Allan E. Alter. a columnist. wrote in Computerworld, a newspaper
         for information technology professionals. But. he added. &quot;we must
         accept our inevitable public role: what the world wants from us is level
         headed,trustworthy guidance in a scary time.&quot;</p>
