                   <p>TESTING, RELIABILITY, AND TRUSTWORTHINESS: <br>
 
                     Informed Consent and the Computing Professional</p>
                   <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
 
                   <p>All professionals have responsibilities and privileges due 
 
                     to their role. Computer professionals are trusted to make 
 
                     technical decisions about software and hardware. These decisions 
 
                     require sensitivity to human values as well as technical expertise. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>The interaction of human values and technical decisions is 
 
                     particularly important in the area of software quality. The 
 
                     question of &quot;how good is good enough&quot; requires values 
 
                     clarification, allocation of resources, prediction of costs, 
 
                     and analyses and predictions that cannot be based on certainty, 
 
                     but should be based on measurement.</p>
 
                   <p>Most software is so complex that guaranteeing perfection 
 
                     in PRODUCT quality, while highly desirable, is infeasible. 
 
                     However, guaranteeing adherence to mutually agreed?upon development 
 
                     PROCESSES from which product quality can be expected to flow 
 
                     is feasible. In the suggestions below we insist that both 
 
                     product and process be addressed when dealing with professional 
 
                     responsibilities for software quality.</p>
 
                   <p>We propose that computer professionals adopt an ethical standard 
 
                     of &quot;informed consent,&quot; as outlined below.</p>
 
                   <p>GUIDING PRINCIPLE</p>
 
                   <p>A software developer should obtain informed consent from 
 
                     the client. A software user should have available information 
 
                     about the safety and reliability of software. The public should 
 
                     be able to obtain detailed information about the testing and 
 
                     reliability measures of any commercial software.</p>
 
                   <p>DEFINITIONS</p>
 
                   <p>&quot;software&quot; : computer programs, internal documentation, 
 
                     design documents, test plans, user manuals, online help, and 
 
                     the like</p>
 
                   <p>&quot;software developer&quot; : any professional involved 
 
                     in the production of computer software: this includes but 
 
                     is not limited to designers, coders, testers, managers, and 
 
                     salespeople</p>
 
                   <p>&quot;client&quot; : the person or entity that pays for the 
 
                     software</p>
 
                   <p>&quot;user&quot; . any human who interacts with the software</p>
 
                   <p>&quot;public&quot; : any citizen or organization</p>
 
                   <p>&quot;informed consent&quot;: see below</p>
 
                   <p>INFORMED CONSENT</p>
 
                   <p>&quot;Informed consent&quot; is a term used in medical ethics. 
 
                     We borrow this term and define it for computer professionals 
 
                     as follows:</p>
 
                   <p>The client of a computer professional who is buying software 
 
                     should be given sufficient information to make a reasonable 
 
                     choice about investing in the software. The developer should 
 
                     disclose information at an appropriate level of detail. The 
 
                     acceptance of the client should be voluntary, and should include 
 
                     a formal authorization whenever possible.</p>
 
                   <p>Words such as &quot;sufficient,&quot; &quot;reasonable,&quot; 
 
                     and &quot;appropriate&quot; can only be defined specific to 
 
                     a particular situation. Part of a professional's responsibility 
 
                     in informed consent is to make these definitions in a good 
 
                     faith for each particular exchange with a client.</p>
 
                   <p>Sometimes the people who buy software are remote from the 
 
                     developer; for example, shrink wrapped software clients. In 
 
                     this case &quot;informed consent&quot; will not be formalized 
 
                     in the same way that it can be when custom software is developed 
 
                     for an individual client. However, informed consent can be 
 
                     approximated in this cases by a good faith effort to make 
 
                     disclosure information available to a customer before purchase.</p>
 
                   <p>Except for those cases where the client cannot be negotiated 
 
                     with directly (such as shrink?wrapped software), we assume 
 
                     below that the client or a representative of the client is 
 
                     available. When the client is not available for direct consultation, 
 
                     the quantifiable information required for informed consent 
 
                     should be available to customers shopping for software.</p>
 
                   <p>IMPLEMENTATION OF INFORMED CONSENT</p>
 
                   <p>The developer should create as part of a contract or as a 
 
                     separate document an informed consent form. This document 
 
                     discloses the information presented by the developer about 
 
                     software quality, and the client's willingness to accept the 
 
                     software knowinq the measurements and limitations included 
 
                     in that document. Informed consent is complete when both the 
 
                     developer and the client sign the document.</p>
 
                   <p>CONTENTS OF AN INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT</p>
 
                   <p>I. Product Measurements:<br>
 
                     This section includes any and all software quality measures 
 
                     agreed to by the<br>
 
                     developer and the client. These could include mean?time?to?failure 
 
                     under a<br>
 
                     certain distribution of inputs; software metrics, either as 
 
                     an average or <br>
 
                     within an acceptable range over all modules; safety conditions 
 
                     that are<br>
 
                     never violated after a certain number of random tests; or 
 
                     any other<br>
 
                     repeatable, verifiable measures. When presenting the informed 
 
                     consent<br>
 
                     document for signing, the developer demonstrates that the 
 
                     software meets or<br>
 
                     exceeds the agreed upon measures. Measures must be defined 
 
                     in such detail<br>
 
                     (such as margins for error, significant digits, rounding protocols) 
 
                     as to be<br>
 
                     unambiguous. Each measurement should?be defined in a single 
 
                     reference<br>
 
                     document that includes this type of detail.</p>
 
                   <p>II. Process Description:<br>
 
                     This section describes the processes used to develop the software 
 
                     and to<br>
 
                     verify its software quality. The developer describes how adherence 
 
                     to the process guidelines is verified. Each process must be 
 
                     described in a single defining reference document.</p>
 
                   <p>III. Assessment Implementation:<br>
 
                     This section details who assesses compliance with the product 
 
                     measurements and the process requirements. This section may 
 
                     include details about who is responsible for what in the assessment 
 
                     phase; for example, either the client<br>
 
                     or the developer may be responsible for the generation of 
 
                     test Cases.</p>
 
                   <p>CONTRACT RAMIFICATIONS</p>
 
                   <p> Informed consent should be a binary transaction: either 
 
                     the two parties mutually accept it, or they do not. Mutual 
 
                     acceptance of an informed consent document is part of the 
 
                     final phase of a software. project. The development of the 
 
                     document should begin in the earliest phases of development, 
 
                     but it cannot be signed until all the described measurements 
 
                     and assessments have been completed. A contract can make reference 
 
                     to the time when this document is signed to determine bonuses 
 
                     or penalties, but the document itself should focus on software 
 
                     quality, not schedule or payment. The issues of time and money 
 
                     are a vital part of the negotiations between client and developer 
 
                     on what level of quality are acceptable; however, informed 
 
                     consent, once agreed to, becomes a required step in acceptance. 
 
                     Renegotiating informed consent is possible, but not encouraged.</p>
 
                   <p>INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENTS AS PUBLIC ARCHIVES</p>
 
                   <p>The informed consent document is made available by the developer 
 
                     in paper electronically (without cost) to the public. User 
 
                     documentation gives information about how to access the document. 
 
                     The IEEE Computer Society maintains a directory to all such 
 
                     electronic documents for publicly available software.</p>
 
                   <p>WHY I THINK THIS MIGHT WORK</p>
 
                   <p>The description above does not require any particular style 
 
                     of testing or<br>
 
                     verification. I do research in testing and reliability techniques, 
 
                     and I<br>
 
                     cannot imagine that the research community or the business 
 
                     community will<br>
 
                     ever reach consensus about which techniques should be required. 
 
                     The<br>
 
                     informed consent form does require mutually agreed to measurements 
 
                     of some<br>
 
                     kind. This seems like a minimum level of professionalism</p>
 
                   <p>By not including contractual details in the document, parties 
 
                     to the consent should be willing to make the document public. 
 
                     A collection of documents could be a rich source of information 
 
                     for researchers in software quality, and public display of 
 
                     these documents would encourage more responsibility from developers 
 
                     and clients.</p>
 
                   <p>We have to do SOMETHING to encourage professionalism in software 
 
                     development. Perhaps an informed consent emphasis will help.</p>
