       <p>For a Project on Ethics and Software Engineering
       <p>by Vivian Weil and Michael Davis</p>
                   <p>Because computers are integral to most businesses, governments,
                     and nonprofit institutions, everything from ballistic missiles
                     to paychecks depends on the quality of software. Yet stories
                     of software failure of one sort or another are common. Some,
                     like Therac?25, involve loss of life, but most??like those
                     involving loss of data??are merely about undue expense, inconvenience,
                     and other injuries to welfare. Our project would be a contribution
                     to preventing such failures.</p>
                   <p>Although software is often viewed as a literary product
                     because it consists of a series of symbols, it resembles
                     traditional engineering products in both function and creation.
                     Some software has in fact replaced complex mechanical devices
                     (for example, mechanical timing gears). Much software is
                     the outcome of systematic research, specification, design,
                     testing, manufacture, measurement, and maintenance. All software
                     can be evaluated in the way engineering products are, by
                     their safety, reliability, durability, utility, cost, and
                     so on. Recognizing that in these ways software creation resembles
                     engineering, many observers for several decades now, have
                     referred to the creation of software as &quot;software engineering.&quot;</p>
                   <p>Yet, reality seems to fall short of the hope expressed in
                     that term. &quot;Software engineers&quot; seldom have a degree
                     in engineering. They in fact have a heterogeneous origin
                     and training. Often, their work lacks the systematic approach
                     of engineering. Neither they nor their employers are willing
                     to vouch for the fitness for use of their work in the way
                     engineers do.</p>
                   <p> 2<br>
   Some observers have identified barriers that have kept creators of software
     from accepting responsibility for the safety, reliability, and utility of
     their products in the way expected of engineers. If this analysis is correct,
     there is a pressing need to remove the barriers that prevent software creators
     from becoming engineers in a full sense. In part the problem is intellectual:
     to conceptualize engineering aided by an understanding of how the practices
     of engineering develop. In part the problem is practical: to figure out how
     to support the development of systematic practices and appropriate standards
     for different domains, e.g. for life critical or mission critical software,
     and for different settings in companies and government agencies. Perhaps
     there should be a minimum standard for all software.</p>
                   <p>There is a need then to deal with the question of software
                     engineering. This would mean at least delineating the appropriate
                     scientific knowledge, the body of techniques of design, and
                     the organizational and managerial aspects of the role. That
                     conceptual exercise is essential to dealing with the practical
                     aspects of bringing an appropriate safety and reliability
                     orientation into the creation of software. A project to facilitate
                     the transition from haphazard ways of creating computer software
                     to more disciplined engineering practices, friendly to creativity
                     but oriented toward safeguarding against risks, would have
                     to include contributions from a number of different sources.
                     These sources include, in addition to computer science: history
                     and philosophy of engineering, ethics, law (with regard to
                     liability), private (and government?) sector employers, and
                     professional societies. The project would include an examination
                     of models of a systems approach to developing software for
                     their applicability in different</p>
                   <p> 3<br>
   contexts and for the distinctive responsibilities they generate. The products
     of the project would be an exemplar of a code of professional responsibility
     designed for software engineers that includes its rationale, and a handbook
     of ethics problems and cases with commentary. These, together with initiatives
     the project would instigate in professional societies and in education, would
     be designed to accelerate the professionalization of software creators.<br>
