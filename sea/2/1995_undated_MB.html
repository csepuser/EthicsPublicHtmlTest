       <p>Status of the task force for defining the required body of<br>
     knowledge and recommended practices</p>
       <p> Patricia Douglas (pjd@vnet.ibm.com)</p>
       <p> As Capers Jones outlined in the article &quot;Legal status of software
         engineering&quot; [Computer, Volume 28, No. 5, May 1995, pages 98?99],
         one of the factors associated with recognized formal professions is &quot;a
         well?defined body of knowledge, and often many subsets of more specialized
         knowledge with an academic curricula to transfer that body of knowledge
         to students. The current work being done within the IEEE Computer Society
         and the ACM task forces is moving towards a goal of making software engineering
         the 37th engineering profession.</p>
       <p>There are three current task forces attached to the joint steering committee
         for the establishment of software engineering as a profession. The task
         forces were chartered by the steering committee to accomplish the following
         recommendations: </p>
       <p>1. Adopt standard definitions 2. Define required body of and recommended
         practices (in electrical engineering, for example, electromagnetic theory
         is part of the body of knowledge while the National Electrical Safety
         Code is a recommended practice.) 3. Define ethical standards 4. Define
         educational curricula The steering committee has also begun to study
         certification or licensing in other engineering professions.<br>
   The task force for establishing the software engineering body of knowledge
   and recommended practices has been moving forward with the author as chair
   and recently a cochair joined me. Anthony Cocchi brings his wealth of experience
   in systems architect, software design and programming to this work. Tony's
   current job responsibility is as a senior designer/programmer from IBM Research.<br>
   The approach being used by the task force is a series of surveys. The surveys
   will be used to define piece by piece the body of knowledge and practices at
   different levels of knowledge/skill needed at different points in the career
   of a Software Engineer. These surveys will capture the categories of components
   of knowledge. These components of knowledge fall into two categories: generic
   knowledge, such as mathematics, science engineering science, etc.; and knowledge
   that is specific to Software Engineering, such as software analysis, software
   architectures, etc. In each area, we will address static knowledge as well
   as dynamic knowledge (thins we do).</p>
       <p>Work began over a year ago using focus groups to establish an exhaustive
         list of all possible areas that should be considered in software engineering.
         Continued work was done to organize this input to establish categories
         that should be included in an international survey. The survey methodology
         was chosen because it allowed for the greatest coverage throughout the
         industry. The format of the survey will allow us to analyze the common
         core of what is currently going on throughout the world as well as those
         areas that are particular in an industry segment.<br>
   Creating the task statements within these areas is being accomplished by organizing
   small groups of experts and creating the task statements that accompany each
   area. The focal point of this work is the establishing of industry sub?chairs
   who will have the following responsibilities:<br>
                       <br>
   Serve as focal point in your industry sector<br>
   Facilitate groups in your area to write task items in identified software areas<br>
   Arrange for the right people to be at the task writing workshop Arrange for
   the location/ send out notices/ serve as host for the task writing workshop<br>
   Identify an individual who can observe the process and conduct further workshops
   for writing task statements as necessary<br>
   Serve as project manager within your industry sector to see that task items
   are completed on schedule and returned to chair<br>
   Identify strategic individuals to assist in distributing the survey and collecting
   the completed survey Work with strategic individuals to assure proper coverage
   for distribution of survey Serve as a communications point for work in progress<br>
   Identify mechanism within industry sector to publicize ongoing work and gain
   support</p>
       <p>We have touched on only 58 topics at this time which is only about 10%
         of what we need. We need people within the industry to serve as sub?chairs
         for this work. Our goal is to have the input for the creation of the
         survey completed by 3Q 95. If you can participate in this work, please
         contact Patricia Douglas (pjd@vnet.ibm.com) or Tony Cocchi (tony@watson.ibm.com).</p>
