                     &gt; owed by professional software engineers in each of these<br>
 
                     &gt; relationships. The first level identified is a set of

                     other human beings<br>
 
                     &gt; by virtue of their humanity. The second level obliges

                     &gt; engineering professionals to more challenging obligations 
 
                     than those<br>
 
                     &gt; required at level one. Level two obligations are required 
 
                     because<br>
 
                     &gt; professionals owe special care to people affected by 
 
                     their work.<br>
 
                     &gt; The third and deeper level comprises several obligations 
 
                     which derive<br>
 
                     &gt; directly from elements unique to the professional practice 
 
                     of software<br>

                     and are<br>
 
                     &gt; intended to direct professional behavior. These directives 
 
                     require<br>
 
                     &gt; significant ethical judgement. Level Two: Expect (to 
 
                     be professional);<br>
 
                     &gt; Statements of expectation express the obligations of 
 
                     all professionals<br>
 
                     &gt; and professional attitudes. Again, they do not describe 
 
                     the specific<br>
 
                     &gt; behavior details, but they clearly indicate professional 
 
                     responsibilities<br>
 
                     &gt; in computing. Level Three: Demand (to use good practices); 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt; statements of demand assert more specific behavioral 
 
                     responsibilities<br>
 
                     &gt; within software engineering, which are more closely related 
 
                     to the<br>
 
                     &gt; current state of the art. The range of statements is 
 
                     from the more<br>
 
                     &gt; general aspirational statement to specific measurable
