       <p>Simon and Don:</p>
       <p>My initial reaction to all of these comments are that we cannot do this
         forever, trying to please everyone over and over. At some point we have
         to say enough.</p>
       <p>Having said that, if we can QUICKLY come to some language that is a
         clear improvement on our already improved language, so be it.</p>
       <p>I'll chime in below, but only a few times.</p>

 &gt; PEOPLE TO THE FULL CODE AND EXPLAINS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CLAUSES</p>
       <p>Suggestion for 2 such sentences: &quot;The short version of the code
         gives the<br>
   aspirational elements at a high level of abstraction; the clauses that<br>
   follow give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way<br>
   we act as professionals. Without the asperations, the details can become<br>
   legalistic and tedious; without the details, the asperation can become<br>
   high sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a<br>
   cohesive code.&quot;</p>
       <p><br>
   You two decide about &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;temperate.&quot; You can't

   everyone, and I'm tired of dancing around on this point.</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.04. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual
 or<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; potential danger to the user, the public, or the environment,
 that<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; they reasonably believe to be associated with software or related<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; documents.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; The deletion of &quot;or merely know about&quot; is detrimental, although
 the<br>
 &gt; &gt; deletion of the word 'merely', itself, is appropriate.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; NO I THINK BELIEVE INCLUDES KNOW ABOUT IN THIS CONTEXT<br>
 &gt; </p>
       <p>Put a cork in it, Ben. What we have here is good.</p>
       <p>&gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.07. Consider issues of physical disabilities, allocation of
 resources,<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; economic disadvantage and other factors that can diminish<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; access to the benefits of software.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Loss of the mentions of language and 'mental access' is detrimental,
 even<br>
 &gt; &gt; if the earlier version was poorly expressed. I prefer:<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 1.07. Endeavour to produce software that respects diversity. Consider<br>
 &gt; &gt; issues including those of language, economic advantage, allocation
 of<br>
 &gt; &gt; resources, and different abilities (including how to make software
 usable<br>
 &gt; &gt; by people with physical and sensory impairments, learning difficulties,<br>
 &gt; &gt; and conditions such as epilepsy).<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; WHILST I HAVE GREAT SYMPATHY WITH THIS I THINK IT BECOMES TOO LONG AND <br>
 &gt; TOO DETAILED ? PERHAPS THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE CAN DEVELOP SOME WORKED <br>
 &gt; EXAMPLE<br>
 &gt; </p>
       <p>Or Ben can work up an example.</p>
       <p>&gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; Principle 3 PRODUCT Software engineers shall ensure that their<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; products and related modifications are of the highest professional<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; standards possible. In particular, software engineers shall, as<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate:<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; The removal of detail improves the sentence. However, loss of the mention<br>
 &gt; &gt; of pruducts being *acceptable*, to to the employer, the client, the
 user<br>
 &gt; &gt; and the public creates a deficiency with the code: it should have become<br>
 &gt; &gt; a clause.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; IF THEY ARE OF THE HIGHEST PROFESIONAL STANDARDS THEN BY INFERNECE THEY <br>
 &gt; WILL BE ACCEPTABLE AS THIS IS PART OF THE DEFINITION OF PROFESSIOANLISM. <br>
 &gt; HOWEVER, THE IDEA OF AN EXTRA CLAUSE (OR ADDITION TO AN EXISTING CLAUSE) <br>
 &gt; IS WORTH DOING<br>
 &gt; </p>
       <p>I disagree, but not violently. If you want to add yet another clause,<br>
   fine. I might point out, however, that you can work to the highest<br>
   standards and still have some idiot not &quot;accept&quot; your work.<br>
   Part of being a professional is knowing when to adhere to standards<br>
   when idiots demand something else.</p>
       <p> &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.01. Strive for high quality, acceptable cost and a reasonable<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; schedule, ensuring significant tradeoffs are clear to the<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; employer, the client, the user and the public.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Making tradeoffs clear is *not* sufficient to compensate for the loss
 of<br>
 &gt; &gt; the call to strive for high quality and acceptable cost for the employer,<br>
 &gt; &gt; client, user, and public.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; I also wonder if the wording is *accidentally* deficient in the way
 it<br>
 &gt; &gt; implies &quot;employer, the client, the user and the public&quot; only
 applies to<br>
 &gt; &gt; tradeoffs, not to &quot;high quality, acceptable cost and a reasonable<br>
 &gt; &gt; schedule&quot;. What about re?ordering the clause to &quot;3.01 For
 each of the<br>
 &gt; &gt; employer, client, user and the public: Strive for high quality, acceptable<br>
 &gt; &gt; cost and a reasonable schedule, ensuring significant tradeoffs are
 clear<br>
 &gt; &gt; to all parties concerned.&quot;<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; THE REWORD IS WRONG WRT SENCE IN THAT IT IS S/W ENGS SHALL ... <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; HOW ABOUT ADDING AFTER &quot;TRADEOFFS ARE CLEAR TO&quot; &quot;AND ACCEPTED
 BY&quot;<br>
 &gt; </p>
       <p>Simon's rewording is better, but remember my point from above.</p>
       <p>&gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.09. Provide realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, personnel,
 and<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; outcomes on any project on which they work or propose to<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; work and provide a risk assessment of these estimates.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; It may not be a given software engineer's responsibility to *provide*
 the<br>
 &gt; &gt; estimates, but it is always the software engineer's responsiblity to<br>
 &gt; &gt; encourage the provision of realistic estimates. The old 1.07 was better<br>
 &gt; &gt; than this replacement. At new 5.05 it only applys to leaders. How about<br>
 &gt; &gt; &quot;3.09 When asked for estimates, provide realistic estimates of
 cost,<br>
 &gt; &gt; scheduling, personnel, and outcomes on any project on which they work
 or<br>
 &gt; &gt; propose to work and provide a risk assessment of these estimates. Argue<br>
 &gt; &gt; against any unrealistic estimates that the software engineer is aware
 of.&quot;<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I THINK A S/W ENG SHOULD NOT ALWAYS WAIT FOR A REQUEST FOR AN ESTIMATE <br>
 &gt; BUT WHERE APPROPRIATE SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING WITHOUT PROMPTING ? SO REJECT <br>
 &gt; BEN'S FIRST POINT. I LIKE THE BIT ABOUT ARGUE AGIANST UNREALISTIC <br>
 &gt; ESTIMATES AND SUGGEST WE INCORPORATE SOME SIUTABLE WORDS IN THIS CLAUSE.<br>
 &gt; </p>
       <p>Change &quot;Provide&quot; to &quot;Ensure.&quot; Enough said.</p>
       <p>&gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.11. Ensure adequate documentation, including significant problems<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; discovered and solutions adopted, for any project on which they<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; work.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; An improvement on the old 1.08, however, it would read better if the
 word<br>
 &gt; &gt; 'of' were inserted between 'including' and 'significant'.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; YES<br>
 &gt; <br>
   This is English vs. American, I think. So I'll vote no, just to be<br>
   internationally insensitive.</p>
       <p>&gt; &gt; &gt; Principle 4 JUDGEMENT Software engineers shall maintain
         integrity<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; and independence in their professional judgement. In particular,<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; software engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Loss of the mention of &quot;protect the reputation of software engineering,<br>
 &gt; &gt; provided such protection is consistent with principle 1&quot; is detrimental.
 I<br>
 &gt; &gt; wonder whether it should be a clause.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; NO ?I THINK WE COVER THIS IN OTHER WAYS<br>
 &gt; <br>
   Right.</p>
       <p>&gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to
 the<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; administration of software development. In particular, those managing<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; and leading software engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; The principle is improved, however, the loss of<br>
 &gt; &gt; 1) acting fairly (in general) and<br>
 &gt; &gt; 2) &quot;enable and encourage those who they lead to meet their own
 and<br>
 &gt; &gt; collective obligations, including those under this code&quot;<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; from the code as a whole is severely detrimental. They could be a new<br>
 &gt; &gt; 5.01 and 5.02 (with the following clauses renumbered).<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; NOT CONVINCED ? LEAVE AS IS<br>
   Yes, leave as is.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; 5.12. Not punish a software engineer for expressing ethical concerns<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; about a project.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Is a good addition. However, as with the new 5.02, 5.03, 5.06, 5.09,
 5.11<br>
 &gt; &gt; (which follow in this email), 5.12 mentions 'software engineer' rather<br>
 &gt; &gt; than covering all employees. The clauses replaced mentioned all<br>
 &gt; &gt; employees, and in these cases it is appropriate. A software engineer
 may<br>
 &gt; &gt; be leading a team that includes people other than sofware engineers
 (for<br>
 &gt; &gt; example administrative support). The good software engineer should
 not<br>
 &gt; &gt; punish *any* employee for expressing ethical concerns about a project,<br>
 &gt; &gt; or ask any employee to do anything inconsistent with this Code, or<br>
 &gt; &gt; attract any potential employee other than by full and accurate<br>
 &gt; &gt; description of the conditions of employment, or hold any employee to<br>
 &gt; &gt; standards before they are informed of them; etc.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; INTERESTING ? SUGGEST WE CHANGE &quot;A SOFTWARE ENGINEER&quot; TO &quot;ANYONE&quot; <br>
   Yes. He is right about this one. My oversight. KM</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; THE DELETION OF THE OLD 6.07 IS A SERIOUSLY DETRIMENTAL CHANGE TO THE<br>
 &gt; &gt; SUBSTANCE OF THE CODE.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I DON'T THINK IT IS THAT BAD<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; 6.11. Consider, as a profession, that violations of this Code
 are<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; inconsistent with being a professional software engineer.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; I do not see how individuals can consider 'as a profession'. Those
 words<br>
 &gt; &gt; should be deleted.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; AGREE<br>
   OK. I know why we put those words in there, but ditch them.</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; 6.12. Express concerns to the people involved when significant<br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; violations of this Code are detected.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; The words &quot;unless this is impossible, dangerous or ineffective&quot; should
 be<br>
 &gt; &gt; added at the end of this clause in addition to having been added to
 the<br>
 &gt; &gt; following one.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; AGREE<br>
   All right. Sigh.</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; 8.08. Encourage colleagues to adhere to this Code.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; This doesn't appear to me to be suitable for the 'self' principle.<br>
 &gt; &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; The old 8.08. &quot;Consider violations of this code inconsistent with
 being a<br>
 &gt; &gt; professional software engineer and encourage colleagues to adhere to<br>
 &gt; &gt; this code.&quot; should be retained, but clarity would be improved
 by the<br>
 &gt; &gt; insertion of the word 'personal' after 'consider'. The new 6.11 does
 not<br>
 &gt; &gt; cover this PERSONAL aspect.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; M DAVIES COMMENT SUGGESTS 8.08 BE SHIFTED<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; SUGGEST WE HAVE 8.08 AS &quot; Consider violations of this code inconsistent<br>
 &gt; with being a professional software engineer&quot;<br>
