                   <p>Ed, </p>
                   <p> Here is some of the comments I have received. </p>
 
                   <p>
 
                     I have already sent an email to Dennis thanking him for his 
 
                     comments. Because it is at the level it is at, we need to 
 
                     respond at two levels; one involving modification or clarification 
 
                     of the code and; at a strategy level- how we plan to package 
 
                     this product? whose code..which professional society &quot;owns-approves 
 
                     it&quot; etc. </p>
 
                   <p>We need a plan on how to do this, before we bring it up to 
 
                     the steering committee again. Hope to talk with you soon. 
 
                     don PS. I don't think I have said this yet.. You did a great 
 
                     job keeping this going. Thanks! </p>
 
                   <p> ---------- Forwarded message ----------</p>
 
                   <p> Don,</p>
 
                   <p>
 
                     I think the steering committee would like to hear some response 
 
                     to my comments and Mary's from those who formulated the draft 
 
                     code of ethics.</p>
 
                   <p> DJF</p>
 
                   <p> ---------- Forwarded message ---------- </p>
 
                   <p>Felipe,</p>
 
                   <p> I share Dennis' general concern that this is fine in theory 
 
                     but hard to apply. I realize that codes of ethics should be 
 
                     idealistic, but they also must be credible -- that is, practitioners 
 
                     should be able to see how the code shapes their work.</p>
 
                   <p> Another way of saying this is that this draft seems a little 
 
                     naive. The Code doesn't discriminate in intensity, even though 
 
                     some of the points are pretty close to absolute and others 
 
                     are currently viewed by many as good practice. </p>
 
                   <p> I'd sign up to expecting an SE to refuse to 
 
                     work on a project that is blatently unsafe or fraudulent. 
 
                     However, 
 
                     deviations from this committee's view of good process doesn't 
 
                     fall in 
 
                     this category, and the Code doesn't distinguish. For example, 
 
                     for me 
 
                     &quot;thou-shalt-absolutely&quot;s include 2.01, 2.03 (but 
 
                     see note), 2.07, 4.04, 
 
                     4.08, 4.09 whereas &quot;you should make a good-faith attempt 
 
                     to&quot; include 
 
                     1.01, 1.05, 4.06, 5.06, 5.11. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p> There are some other points that require each software engineer 
 
                     to control things over which he/she has no control. Naturally 
 
                     the SE should try to achieve all this, by working within the 
 
                     company if not directly. But holding individual SEs responsible 
 
                     for things outside their control is another place where the 
 
                     degree of responsibility and consequence isn't clear: 1.01, 
 
                     1.06, 1.07, 1.09, 1.12, 3.04, 4.02, 6.06, 6.10 </p>
 
                   <p>There are some points at which mechanism creeps in. The Code 
 
                     should, I think, state the objective and leave implementation 
 
                     to the best judgement of the engineer. (This is the usual 
 
                     rule about specifications.)</p>
 
                   <p> Examples: 1.01 (the new one about written specs, added between 
 
                     Aug 8 and Sep 30), 2.02 (the &quot;well-documented&quot; part), 
 
                     2.03 (the &quot;affix signature&quot; part), 5.13, 6.02 (the 
 
                     only way I can understand this one is as an implementation 
 
                     of something I haven't figured out yet). </p>
 
                   <p> A particular problem area is international business. Even 
 
                     if the Code is intended for US practice, many US firms operate 
 
                     internationally. 3.02 and 3.03 (on bribes, kickbacks, etc) 
 
                     don't really address the very gray situation in some countries. 
 
                     For example, I understand that in some countries customs officials 
 
                     are not supposed to take payments (by whatever name), but 
 
                     the computation that yields their salaries assumes they *are* 
 
                     receiving such payments. </p>
 
                   <p>There are also omissions in the handling of intellectual 
 
                     property. Piracy appears in 4.04, confidentiality and public 
 
                     domain IP are used inconsistently in 4.05, copyright but not 
 
                     patent appears as part of a list in 4.07, trade secret and 
 
                     nondisclosure are mentioned nowhere at all (though 4.05 was 
 
                     probably intended to address them), there's also nothing about 
 
                     export restriction, and what's there about privacy is politically 
 
                     loaded.</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     On the whole, I think the document would be more likely to 
 
                     be read if 
 
                     it were shorter, crisper, and more realistic. A supplementary 
 
                     document 
 
                     could work through examples in a little more detail than the 
 
                     2-liners 
 
                     that constitute most of this document.</p>
 
                   <p> Specific comments:</p>
 
                   <p> Introduction:</p>
 
                   <p> - &quot;to assure ... used for good&quot; makes me uneasy 
 
                     (who gets to decide what's &quot;good&quot;?) - The last sentence 
 
                     about the second-order bullets being incomplete sets of examples 
 
                     is pretty obscure.</p>
 
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
 
                   <p> Rule 1</p>
 
                   <p>-1.04: Who on earth gets to decide whether goals are &quot;proper&quot;?
 
                   <p>
 
                     -1.10: software/documentation seems mismatched to privacy. 
 
                     Privacy probably belongs under Rule 2 anyhow. Further, there's 
 
                     a big difference in the privacy arena between what's legal 
 
                     in the US and what many people think is &quot;proper&quot;. 
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     - 1.13: What if the client wants quality of product (==&gt; 
 
                     not minimum price) and quality of life for SEs and programmers 
 
                     (==&gt; not maximum productivity)?
 
                   <p> - 1.14: It is not the case that &quot;fad&quot; is the same 
 
                     thing as &quot;departure from standard practice&quot;. In 
 
                     fact, there's a good case that some standard practices ARE 
 
                     fads. 
 
                   <p>&nbsp; 
 
                   <p> 
 
                     Rule 2 
 
                   <p>- 2.03 Presumably this means engineering documents about 
 
                     the product, not other documents the SE may sign at various 
 
                     times? </p>
 
                   <p>- 2.07 Wouldn't it be nice to have a level of practice that 
 
                     allowed this? </p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     Rule 3</p>
 
                   <p> - 3.02, 3.03 See note above about the realities of international 
 
                     business.</p>
 
                   <p> - 3.05, 3.06 Are these acts always and without exception 
 
                     unethical? I've been a member of a number of groups in which 
 
                     potential conflicts were managed other than by complete exclusion. 
 
                     Indeed, 3.07 offers an alternative, thereby creating disagreement 
 
                     among 3.05, 3.06, and 3.07. </p>
 
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     Rule 4</p>
 
                   <p> - 4.01 I agree with Dennis.</p>
 
                   <p> - 4.05 Good sentiment, but imprecise statement. There are 
 
                     many degrees of confidentiality to observe. In particular, 
 
                     copyright material is widely availablle in books but not public 
 
                     domain. Do you really mean an SE should say &quot;I found 
 
                     the algorithm in a standard textbook but must keep it confidential?&quot; 
 
                     That's what this point says.</p>
 
                   <p> - 4.07 Why just *copyright* laws? Why not *all* laws? </p>
 
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     Rule 5</p>
 
                   <p> - 5.08 How does this differ from 2.05? </p>
 
                   <p>&nbsp; </p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     Rule 6</p>
 
                   <p> - 6.02 Is it the intention of the Code to eliminate anonymous 
 
                     refereeing? That wouldn't be consistent with 5.13. More seiously, 
 
                     engineers review engineering artifacts regularly. As far as 
 
                     I know, reviewers of public artifacts don't check in first. 
 
                     This would preclude product reviews undertaken without prior 
 
                     warning to the developer; it would impede product selection 
 
                     in the same way. What is this really trying to say?</p>
