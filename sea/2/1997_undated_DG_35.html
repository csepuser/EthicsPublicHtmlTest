 Electronic 
 
                   Document <!-- InstanceEndEditable --> </h3></div>		
		
      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" -->
 
                   <div align="justify">A brief summary of the general direction 
 
                     of the modifications on version 3 to make 4. </div>
 
                   <p align="justify">The Title was a problem. Pure ethics folks 
 
                     complained that there were practical items in the Code, after 
 
                     all it was called a Code of Ethics. Because the Code is both 
 
                     a Code of Ethics and a Code of Professional Practice, we changed 
 
                     the name of the Code.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Sanctions: Several comentators ignored the 
 
                     educational and social functions of a Code and are concerned 
 
                     to use it as a club rather than a guide to decision making 
 
                     and practice. They wanted to turn the Code into a legal document 
 
                     which could be used to beat evil software engineers into submission. 
 
                     The SEEPP task force can only set out guidelines and standards 
 
                     of practice for a profession.. It is not the business of a 
 
                     Code to become a legislative document. The only sense in which 
 
                     we responded to that is to model the ACM Code and say &#8220; 
 
                     8.08. Consider that personal violations of this Code are inconsistent 
 
                     with being a professional software engineer&#8221;. Size: 
 
                     There were several concerns voiced that the code was too large 
 
                     to remember and it could not be placed on a wallet card. There 
 
                     were mixed reactions to the size question. One commentator 
 
                     wrote &quot; My initial reaction was &quot;major overkill&quot;, 
 
                     but I was wrong. I like it! I might even call myself a software 
 
                     engineer.&#8221;</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Response: The Code was reduced in size by 
 
                     30% and the Principles were modified so that they could stand 
 
                     as a short version with a pointer to the full Code.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Using the comments, all clauses that received 
 
                     greater than 4% opposition were revisited using the comments 
 
                     received to address specific problems. Those problems were 
 
                     primarily of two sorts, the clause was not clear and asserted 
 
                     something we did not intend or we phrased the clause so it 
 
                     required the software engineer to adjust something that was 
 
                     out of his control. The two prime examples of this are clause 
 
                     1.12 and 2.05.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">&#8220;1.12(v.3) Whenever appropriate, delete 
 
                     outdated or flawed data&#8221; Received a 12% negative vote. 
 
                     The largest negative vote, because it asked software engineers 
 
                     to delete data; not archive it, not request of appropriate 
 
                     authorities to have it deleted so 1.12 in version 4.0 became 
 
                     3.14.(v.4) Maintain the integrity of data, being sensitive 
 
                     to outdated or flawed occurrences</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">&#8220;2.05.(v.3) Endeavor to produce software 
 
                     that respects diversity. Issues of language, different abilities, 
 
                     physical access, mental access, economic advantage, and allocation 
 
                     of resources should all be considered.&#8221; Received the 
 
                     second largest negative vote -10%. The word &#8220;diversity&#8221; 
 
                     led many to think this was a clause about political correctness 
 
                     when it was really a clause about access. This clause was 
 
                     changed to: 1.07.(v.4) Consider issues of physical disabilities, 
 
                     allocation of resources, economic disadvantage and other factors 
 
                     that can diminish access to the benefits of software. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The next highest level of opposition -6%- 
 
                     were addressed at technical issues such as outside the software 
 
                     engineers control, e.g., &#8220; 1.06. Ensure good management 
 
                     for any project on which they work, including effective procedures 
 
                     for promotion of quality and reduction of risk.&#8221;</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The risk reduction was moved into other clauses 
 
                     and the good management was shifted under the Principle dealing 
 
                     with Management.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">All comments were reviewed and the Code was 
 
                     modified accordingly</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> </p>
