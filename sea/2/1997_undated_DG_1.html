                     Cleaning out my office I came across- (this is the order they 
 
                     are in the envelope)</p>
                   <p><br>
 
                     1. Notes from my review of the Kanko student comments - paper 
 
                     written in red ink- I have typed up a transcription in case 
 
                     you cannot read my handwriting. I also included an explanation 
 
                     of what the marks on the paper mean.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     2. &quot;SE Profession&quot; Email from Laurie Werth through 
 
                     the SE newsletter called FASE Which contains the 15 April 
 
                     1993 version of Fletcher Buckley's motion. Notice that in 
 
                     the cover letter it says &quot;The following motion or some 
 
                     slightly altered version...&quot; There had been other versions 
 
                     from Buckley before this one.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     3. &quot;Don G notes of meeting&quot; This file created May 
 
                     28 1994 has some temporal proximity to the steering committee 
 
                     meeting so they reflect my thoughts close to the time of the 
 
                     meeting. From the notes- Elliot had a lot of input. Notice 
 
                     the expression<br>
 
                     `code of ethics' is not used. My notes record the origin of 
 
                     the concentric circle model. It also records a claim made 
 
                     by Elliot about focusing on Core practices -the areas of professional 
 
                     practice, (like a code of practice rather than a Code of Ethics). 
 
                     This<br>
 
                     was supported by Dennis. Question marks indicate I was going 
 
                     to pursue this further.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     4. Report to the IEEE CS Board of Governors November 10, 1993. 
 
                     Several important things to note. First this document is written 
 
                     prior to the ACM involvement. I am not sure of the date I 
 
                     have a reference on it I I-12 Dec ACM involvement- my notes 
 
                     indicate that Gwen Bell- then ACM president did not want to 
 
                     chair the committee but that a Co-chair needed to be selected. 
 
                     Appendix 2 which contains an ACM resolution to establish a 
 
                     commission on Software Engineering is concerned with questioning 
 
                     the status of SE as a discipline rather than professionalizing 
 
                     SE The original definition of profession in the document does 
 
                     not include `service'. The recommendation for ethical standards</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     3.3 does not specify the type of deliverable. The examples 
 
                     of `unethical' involve violation of the law.<br>
 
                     It also contains the enabling memo and a list of the original 
 
                     IEEE committee.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     5. &quot;March 4 1994 IEEE BOG minutes&quot; - Now the ethics 
 
                     task force is to `define a Code of Ethic&quot; -ACM does not 
 
                     seem to be a full participant yet.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     6. &quot;ACM and IEE minute 5/28/94 Pittsburgh- I was there-you 
 
                     have referenced this already in the book. Only Action item 
 
                     for SEEPP seems to be to get a press release to the ACM and 
 
                     CS leaders.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     7. A collection of things related to Stuart Feldman. In order 
 
                     to get anything published we were told that it needed a disclaimer 
 
                     and Feldman was assigned by the Steering Committee to be the 
 
                     author April 14 letter from Feldman. April 24 contains,<br>
 
                     Feldman's original paragraph' revision of paragraph by Keith 
 
                     and Simon's addition in upper case about policy makers. Email 
 
                     to Tom Jewett- editor of SIGCAS setting up the publication 
 
                     of version 2.1 some modifications were made at the last minute 
 
                     to 2.1 based on comments by Peter Prinzivali- email also attached.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     8. Set of Documents indicating changes made in the movement 
 
                     to version 2. 2a,2.1 -letter from Miller -modifications by 
 
                     Ben Fairweather in Bold, responding to Prinzavali's concerns 
 
                     in next email -email Duncan Langford - Letter to task force<br>
 
                     containing reports and plan and soliciting comments -MD- there 
 
                     is a line I wrote then about structure of the code being similar 
 
                     to British computer society and NSPE Codes. If I remember 
 
                     correctly in chap 4 you claim this as your original contribution. 
 
                     You may wan t to check these. .</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     9 Moving to version 3. Ben's Comments . The first suggestion 
 
                     that the ordering of Principles is wrong. &quot;Principle 
 
                     2 is more important than Principle 1&quot; Our review is indicated 
 
                     by -check marks means -incorporate it, question marks mean 
 
                     `discuss it'</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     10. Making version 2 a collection of the changes and arguments 
 
                     for them to version 1. Shows some of how we worked. Simon 
 
                     and I would work over stuff, send it to Keith for comment 
 
                     and modify. We would also include others reviews. Then we 
 
                     would<br>
 
                     launch it to the task force. - Keith email -Keith email which 
 
                     is a response to my earlier email. 2 things here- 1) why the 
 
                     reports had to be written by early February and 2) a description 
 
                     of some of my concerns with version 1. -email about restructuring 
 
                     the clauses within the principles Email listing the changes 
 
                     to principles t and 2 in version 2.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     11. Evidence about Email stuff the answer about the SE-ethics 
 
                     list at CMIJ. It was just for the working groups leaders who 
 
                     then had responsibility to communicate with their groups Email 
 
                     from Vivian about your email address. Note that list shows 
 
                     you already on list as specified to me.</p>

                   <p><br>
 
                     13 5.1 to 5.2 1998- After the Code passed the IEEE Technical 
 
                     review. Someone at IEEE asked that it undergo a review by 
 
                     a lawyer. This document is that review. It was judged by those 
 
                     at IEEE-CS that it had passed the review. He spotted a typo 
 
                     in the Code. Fixing that turned the Code into version 5.2 
 
                     . Life should have b een easy from that point. BUT.....<br>
