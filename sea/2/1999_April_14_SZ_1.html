       <p>It's hard refute Dave Parnas' arguments. We need to do what is right. 
         We must not let the existing &quot;Craft Guild&quot; approaches to the 
         practice of software engineering take precedence over the public interest. 
         The practice of medicine is far from perfect. I don't think the public 
         would accept the impossibility of perfect medical practice as a reason 
         to &quot;de regulate&quot; the practice of medicine.

       <p></p>
       <p>Gentlemen ,There was a conference call last week between a task force
          ACM set up to study software engineering licensing and the Texas Board
         
         (Speed, May and Dorchester). I thought you would be interested in an
         E  mail from Dave Parnas. He was scheduled to be included in the conference
         
         call in fact I think he is on the ACM task force, but was not available
          at the time so they recorded the conversations to forward to him. He
         has 
         made some comments based on the tape and I thought you would be interested
          in them. I would be interested in any comments you might have. Thanks
         
         for all of your help.</p>

       <p></p>
       <p></p>
       <p> Last night I had the opportunity to listen to the tape of the<br>
         &gt; conversation that some of you had with the Texas Board of Engineers<br>
         &gt; and I made a few notes I am afraid that I am not great at<br>
         &gt; &quot;voice recognition&quot;so I am not sure who said what. I made<br>
         &gt; a few notes</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>&gt; 1. Perfection is the enemy of the good.</p>
       <p>&gt; A constant theme from people with non-Texas accents was that it
          is beyond the state of the art today to make errorfree software or software
         
         with the &quot;quality that one would expect of a professional engineer':
          I consider this a &quot;red herring': It may come as a surprise to 
           some of you, but we don't seem able to design perfect cars&gt; (witness
          the recalls), perfect radios, perfect buildings (come  and see my
           office) or perfect anything else. Despite our  inability to build
            perfect products, we continue to build them and should be trying to
           improve 
         the situation. I have to believe that people who have met a well thoughtout
            set of educational requirements and have appropriate guided experience
           
         will do a better job than someone who could not find a job as a historian
            and so went into software without any education on that topic.</p>
       <p>2. A frequently repeated statement was something to the effect that 'The 
         Body of Know/edge isn't there': With apologies to those who said that, 
         I think it is nonsense. There is a lot of know/edge (science, computer 
         science, mathematics, certain engineering areas) that should be known 
         to a software developer and most of it is not known. Sure, there is a/ways 
         a need for more research, (which is why I remain an active researcher) 
         but today the greatest need is for education and technology transfer. 
         The bad systems that 1 see, and lots of papers, show a lack of knowledge 
         of ideas that were well understood 10 years ago.</p>
       <p>In fact, when we developed our 4 year SE programme here at McMaster we 
         had to leave a lot out. We collected what we wanted to teach and thought 
         relevant and then the hard work began as why tried to figure out what 
         part of that we could fit into a tightly packed programme. Moreover, none 
         of it is transient know/edge. It is all material that we believe would 
         have been useful if we had known it 20 years ago and will be useful decades 
         from now. The only p/ace where we have producttechnology dependent material 
         is in the laboratory portion of some courses where they have to use some 
         products. My analogy, from EE, is a circuit theory course. Most of what 
         I /earned insuch courses 40 years ago i5still useful today. In the labs, 
         I /earned how to struggle with primitive &quot;scopes': That is useless 
         today. We have the same distinction in our programme.</p>
       <p>The body of know/edge is growing and, to a lesser extent, changing just 
         as it is in EE or Civil Engineering, but that is certainly no reason not 
         to institute licensing. As the body of know/edge grows so do our expectations 
         but one of the expectations of profesSional engineers is that they keep 
         up with the changes.</p>
       <p>I also disagree with the often repeated statement that engineers do not 
         understand the rapid rate of growth in software technology. Often that 
         is all that they understand. What they do not understand is the fundamentals.</p>
       <p>I observe that what is worth knowing in EE has changed as much in my 
         working lifetime as what is worth knowing insoftware. When 1 started my 
         Ph. D., there were 'advisors&quot; who told me to avoid semiconductor 
         research because it would never be practical,<br>
         <br>
         never be able to handle audio /eve/ power, etc. Think of the change since 
         that time. When 1 worked as a radio engineer, we were told that trees 
         could be avoided in antenna design. Today, that is false. Change is rapid 
         in all areas of Engineering and licenses are still valuable.</p>
       <p>.3. Different types of software</p>
       <p>Another remark was that we can t license because there are too many different 
         types of software. Again, this would pule out licensor in other areas 
         of engineering. There are many different types of buildings, bridges, 
         circuits, etc. A power p/ant designer and a circuit designer have very 
         different constraints. However, the fundamental laws (Maxwell laws, Kirchoffs 
         laws) are the same for both. The mathematics is often the same for both. 
         The methods are often very dose. This is true for software. Much of what 
         we can teach applies to many types of software.</p>
       <p>4. Get rid of the worst, identify the best</p>
       <p>We all know many incompetents who describe themselves as software engineers, 
         do not bother to read or learn, and do a terrible job. Licensur would 
         not get rid of all of them, but it might get rid of some of the worst 
         or force them to learn something. It would also identify some of the best.</p>
       <p>5, Beneficial effects even when license not required.</p>
       <p>Because it is their job, the Texas Board people focus on the situations 
         in which a license is required or people practice without a license. However, 
         in Engineering the licensur system has beneficial effects even though 
         most graduates do not get a license. It has encouraged educators to think 
         about defining the core body of know/edge in each field. and to make sure 
         that people learn it. People working for a license learn important things 
         even if they never use the license. Some employers want either PE or PE 
         qualified people because they know what they know and fee/ they can trust 
         them. If l were hiring an engineer today and had a choice between one 
         with a license and one without, and other things were about the same, 
         I would take the licensed one.</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>6. Educational programmes</p>
       <p>Someone mentioned that the web site contains pointers to SE programmes. 
         The issues can be understood in more depth<br>
         <br>
         if you look at those. In particular, I hope you will look at the McMaster 
         programme. It is one of the first to be design for accreditation in Canada. 
         It is the only one that is not a mixture of existing CS and Computer Engineering 
         courses t contains all new courses aimed at people who will be profess 
         engineers specialising in software. You should also look at the programme 
         at the University of Ottawa. This program also appears to meet licensing 
         requirements but does it by<br>
         using a lot of older CS and CE courses</p>
       <p>In our education programme you will find some thing 5 that a. not universally 
         required. Even in my EE programme there were things that only a fraction 
         of us would use. However, in our programme I think you will find little 
         that will get out of date.</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>7 The licenser requirement is there now.</p>
       <p>The call makes it clear that the license requirement is there now. It 
         may not a/ways be enforced and it is clear that the criteria may not be 
         right, but ACM cannot decide whether or not there should be licenser. 
         What ACM can do is help to improve the system by working on the identification 
         of the core body of know/edge. I have looked at the IEEE committee and 
         believe that they need more ACM input. In particular, th need input from 
         scientists to make sure that the &quot;core body&quot; includes fundamentals 
         rather than fads and folk/ore.</p>
