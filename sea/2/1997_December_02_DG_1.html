         position here to get responses from industry people (I'm still in Spain),

       <p align="center"> <strong>1. Products</strong></p>
       <p>Principle 1: PRODUCT. </p>
       <p>Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, ensure that the software
         on which they work is useful and of acceptable quality to the public,
         the employer, the client, and the user; completed on time and at reasonable
         cost; and free of error. In particular, software engineers shall, as
         appropriate:</p>
       <p> I am not clear on the differences between these four groups. Perhaps
         a simple scenario would be helpful as a footnote or in the preamble.
         The employer pays for and directs your work. The client commissions the
         work. The user uses the work. The public are those not directly involved.
         Suppose a bank hires the software firm you work for to develop a program
         for tellers. The bank is the client. The software firm is the employer.
         A teller is a user (or is the person seeing the teller a user, too?).
         The public includes the person do banking with the teller, accountants,
         competitors, and the rest of humanity. Defining and using terms consistently
         is an important part of a code. Otherwise, how can we talk about the
         same thing? [42a]</p>
       <p>PERHAPS, BUT I'M NOT SURE WHERE IT SHOULD BE</p>
       <p> 1.01. Ensure that specifications for software on which they work have
         been well documented, satisfy the user's requirements, and have the client's
         approval.</p>
       <p> 1.02. Strive to fully understand the specifications for software on
         which they work.</p>
       <p> 1.03. Ensure that they are qualified, by an appropriate combination
         of education and experience, for any project on which they work or propose
         to work.</p>
       <p>A side comment: some clauses, such as 1.01 and 1.02, refer to &quot;software
         on which they work&quot; while other clauses, such as 1.03 and 1.04,
         refer to &quot;project on which they work.&quot; If there is little or
         no distinction, the code should only use one term consistently. If there
         is a distinction, perhaps it could be mentioned. (It looks like I'm suggesting
         a glossary of sorts.) [42a] THIS POINT HAS SOME MERIT, ALTHOUGH I CAN
         SEE THE REASON FOR THE DIFFERENT WORDS.</p>
       <p> 1.04. Ensure proper and achievable goals and objectives for any project
         on which they work or propose.</p>
       <p> 1.10. Work to develop software and related documents that respect the
         privacy of those who will be AFFECTED BY that software.</p>
       <p> Are these the clients mentioned earlier? Or the users? Or the public?
         (&quot;subjected&quot; is a very emotionally charged word.) I don't see
         how software documentation can possibly violate someone's privacy (unless
         they are used as an example in a training manual.) How about ensure that
         the software respects the privacy all concerned [42a]</p>
       <p> 1.11. Be careful to use only accurate data derived from ETHICAL AND
         legal sources, and use only in ways properly authorized.</p>
       <p> I'd like to see &quot;ethical&quot; in addition to &quot;legal.&quot; Some
         things may not be against the law, but not be ethical. In fact, much
         data collection today is legal, but invades the privacy of the public.
         Should this be broadened to cover operating legally? For instance, a
         patented algorithm may be used illegally and it only very loosely can
         be considered not in the spirit of 1.11 since it refers to data. [42a]</p>
       <p> 1.12. Whenever appropriate, DELETE, MARK OR REPORT AS INVALID outdated
         or flawed data 1.12</p>
       <p> If the word &quot;delete&quot; is changed to &quot;delete, mark or
         report as invalid,&quot; then this makes sense. Otherwise, it calls on
         the employee to delete data that belongs to the employer, and over which
         he may not have authority. Maybe this is covered by &quot;whenever appropriate.&quot;[27a]</p>
       <p> It may be adequate even preferable to flag outdated or flawed dada
         so that we don't lore history. Suggest &quot;... delete or clearly label
         outdated or ...&quot;[28a]</p>
       <p> 1.12 ? Your outdated data might be my regression test data to keep
         a 10 year old program running. Deleting bad data is good. [43a]</p>
       <p align="center"> <strong>2. Public</strong></p>
       <p>Principle 2: PUBLIC</p>
       <p> Software engineers shall, in their professional role, act only in ways
         consistent with the public safety, health and welfare. In particular,
         software engineers shall:</p>
       <p> 2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or
         potential danger to the user, THE PUBLIC, or the environment, that they
         reasonably believe to be associated with software or related documents
         for which they are responsible, AND KNOW ABOUT. 2.01</p>
       <p> The wording &quot; merely know about&quot; implies a very weak position
         and should be removed. [9i]</p>
       <p> where did this &quot;third party&quot; come from? isn't that the public?
         [42A]</p>
       <p></p>
       <p> 2.06. Be fair and AVOID DECEPTION in all statements, particularly public
         ones, concerning software or related documents 2.06</p>
       <p> In item 2.06 you sat, &quot;Be fair and truthful in all statements....&quot;.
         Consider using a term such as &quot;avoid deception&quot;, which not
         only prohibits falsehoods, but also covers the case of deceiving via
         not disclosing relevant information, in other words, deception by omission.
         [4i]</p>
       <p> 2.07 BALANCE SELF?INTEREST, THE INTERESTS OF an employer, the interest
         of a client, AND the interest of the user WITH THE PUBLIC GOOD</p>
       <p> The public would be interested in getting my services for free. How
         about &quot;balance self?interest, the interest of ... with the public
         good&quot;? [42a]</p>
       <p> 2.09. Accept full responsibility for their own work. 2.09</p>
       <p> SHOULD BE FIRST ? in fact section 2 should be #1.[13a] I AGREE</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>3.Judgement</strong></p>
       <p>Principle 3: </p>
       <p>JUDGMENT Software engineers shall, insofar as possible and consistent
         with Principle 2, protect both the independence of their professional
         judgment and their reputation for such judgment. In particular, software
         engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
       <p> 3.04. DO NOT ACCEPT SECRET PAYMENTS from a PARTY OUTSIDE THE CONTRACT.
         3.04</p>
       <p> You phases on the short sheet are more clear than &quot;no payback....&quot;. &quot;DO
         NOT ACCEPT SECRET PAYMENTS.&quot; [9i]</p>
       <p> The phrase &quot;third party to a contract&quot; Seems Odd. I think
         it should be &quot;party outside the contract&quot; since I'm sure contracts
         can have fourth and fifth parties, too.[42a] </p>
       <p> 3.07. Participate in any decision of a governmental or professional
         body, as a member or advisor, concerned with software, or related documents,
         ONLY AFTER DISCLOSING ANY FINANCIAL INTERESTS OF THEIR OWN, their employer,
         or their client.</p>
       <p>I think a better approach is to require me to disclose any and all interest
         i have in the subject? financial and otherwise ? and let the other people
         take it into account. That is , assume the people who asked for my opinion
         are intelligent enough to know how to interpet it. If they're complete
         idiots, Im probably wouldn't waste my time talking to them, anyway. [11i]</p>
       <p align="center"> <strong>4.Client and Employer</strong></p>
       <p>PRINCIPLE 4: CLIENT AND EMPLOYER. </p>
       <p>Software engineers shall, consistent with the public health, safety,
         and welfare, always act in professional matters as faithful agents and
         trustees of their client or employer. In particular, software engineers
         shall:</p>
       <p> 4.01. Provide service only in areas of their competence OR WHERE THEY
         HAVE SUFFICIENT BACKGROUND TO LEARN. 4.01</p>
       <p> Item 4.01 reading, &quot;Provide service only in areas of their competence.&quot; may
         be a bit too restrictive. There are circumstances where it may be appropriate
         to accept assignments outside one's area of competence. The important
         point is to disclose fully one's limitations. [4i]</p>
       <p> Asks software engineers to &quot;provide service only in areas of their
         competence.&quot; This might lead one to believe that learning &quot;on
         the job&quot; is not acceptable. Perhaps more clarification is needed
         here.[16a]</p>
       <p> 4.04. Not knowingly use UNETHICALLY obtained or retained software.
         4.04</p>
       <p> &quot;illegally&quot; change to &quot;unethically&quot;[13a]</p>
       <p align="center"></p>
       <p align="center"><strong>5. Management</strong></p>
       <p>Principle 5 MANAGEMENT.</p>
       <p>A software engineer in a management or leadership capacity shall act
         fairly and shall enable and encourage those who they lead to meet their
         own and collective obligations, including those under this code. In particular,
         those software engineers in leadership roles shall as appropriate:</p>
       <p> Note that I would add two additional clauses under this section: *
         Not punish software engineers informing leadership of problems in the
         project (as mentioned in clause 4.07 of this code) * In cases where software
         engineers with appropriate education and experience are not immediately
         available for the project, to ensure the software engineers that are
         selected for the project are given appropriate education for the project
         [40a] THESE TWO POINTS HAVE MERIT </p>
       <p>5.06. Attract employees only by full and accurate description of the
         conditions of employment AND WORKING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING EXPECTATIONS
         REGARDING HOURS, SHIFT WORK, OVERTIME, ETC.</p>
       <p> I'd rather say: &quot;Attract employees only by full and accurate description
         of the conditions of employment and working conditions, including expectations
         regarding hours, shift work, overtime, etc.&quot; to make it clear what's
         being referred to. [40A]</p>
       <p> 5.07. Offer fair and just remuneration.</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>6. Profession</strong></p>
       <p>Principle 6: PROFESSION. </p>
       <p>Software engineers shall, in all professional matters, advance both
         the integrity and reputation of their profession as is consistent with
         public health, safety, and welfare. In particular, software engineers
         shall, insofar as possible:</p>
       <p> 6.01. Associate only with reputable businesses and organizations.</p>
       <p> 6.01 Sounds good in theory, but I'm not so certain about practice. &quot;Reputable&quot; is
         very subjective, and very much defined by &quot; the establishment&quot;.
         A software engineer working for protesters against the war in Viet Nam
         could easily have been charged with working with a disreputable group.
         [2i] THIS IS A VALID POINT, BUT I CAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT
         IN A SIMPLE WAY.</p>
       <p> 6.03. Support those who ACT IN A MANNER COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT this code
         requires.</p>
       <p> Uncertain about wording: &quot;those who *do* as this code requires.&quot; The
         group is identified by action, not by profession. How about &quot;Support
         other software engineers in striving to follow this code.&quot; [42a]</p>
       <p> 6.10. Obey all REGULATIONS governing their work, insofar as such obedience
         is consistent with the public health, safety, and welfare. 6.10</p>
       <p> Are not &quot;laws&quot; suppose to be the best interest of the public.
         If so then why or how could the SE violate the code by following the
         law, otherwise the code would be better then the law and the SE would
         somehow have the capacity to know this. How? [9i]</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>7. Colleagues</strong></p>
       <p>Principle 7: COLLEAGUES. </p>
       <p>Software engineers shall treat all those with whom they work fairly
         and take positive steps to support collegial activities. In particular,
         software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
       <p> 7.02. Review the work of other software engineers, which is not in
         the public domain, only with their prior knowledge, UNLESS IT IS IN THE
         INTERESTS OF public health, safety, and welfare TO DO OTHERWISE.</p>
       <p> 7.03. Credit fully the work of others.</p>
       <p> 7.04. Review the work of others in an objective, candid, and properly?documented
         way.</p>
       <p> SWITCH THIS WITH 7.03 SO THE CLAUSES ABOUT REVIEWING ARE TOGETHER.[42A]</p>
       <p> 7.07. Not interfere in the professional career progression of any colleague
         OR OTHER SOFTWARE ENGINEER UNLESS IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST (AND DROP
         7.08??). 7.07</p>
       <p> &quot;Not interfere in the professional career progression of any colleague.&quot; is
         one that, while very reasonable on its face, and in many situations clearly
         one that we would like to see enforced, can easily be perverted to serve
         unethical purposes. There is a history of such provision in the codes
         of engineering societies being used to attack conscientious engineers
         pointing out serious wrongdoing by other engineers that threatened the
         public safety or welfare. You might refer to my book for examples. (I
         failed to prevent such a provision from being inserted in the IEEE code.)
         [4i]</p>
       <p> 7.07 - Some folks need their careers interfered with. This would lead
         me to think I could no get rid of an incompetent engineer because I would
         most certainly be hindering their career in software. There are also
         people who are good but miscast in the role they want to play and need
         nudged into areas fitting their talents.[43a]</p>
       <p>7.08. Not undermine another software engineer's job prospects for one's
         own personal gain.</p>
       <p> In areas where competitive negotiation is expected, I should not be
         my brother's keeper. For 4.08,5.07,6.07, and 7.08, I shouldn't have to
         worry about avoiding self interest so long as power relationship is reasonably
         symmetric. Self interest needs to be -eschewed- Only where very asymmetric
         relationship exist.[28a]</p>
       <p> 7.08 I am concerned about the wording here --note the survey sheet
         says &quot;Do no pursue a job offered to a colleague&quot; ?? if that
         sort of &quot;agree not to compete&quot; meaning is intended, then I
