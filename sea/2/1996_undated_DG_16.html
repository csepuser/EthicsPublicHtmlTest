       <p align="justify">vi. This code sets responsibility for organizations
         and others dealing with software engineers</p>
       <p align="center"> PREAMBLE</p>
       <p align="justify">Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce,
         industry, government, medicine, entertainment, and ordinary life. Those
         who contribute to the design and development of software systems have
         enormous opportunities both to do good and to cause harm. To assure,
         as much as possible, that this power will be used for good, software
         engineers must commit themselves to making the design and development
         of software a beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance with
         that commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the following code
         of ethics. </p>
       <p align="justify">structure The code contains eight keyword principles
         related to the behavior and decisions made by professional software engineers,
         be they policy makers,, managers and superviosrs, practitioners, trainees,
         educators or students.(&lt;- need to fix order.) The Principles identify
         the various relationships in which individuals, groups,and orgaizations
         participate and (sample, indicative ) obligations within these relationships.
         . Each principle of this code addresses all three levels of ethical obligation
         owed by professional software engineers in each of these realtionships.
         It identifies a set of ethical values which they share with all other
         human beings by virtue of their humanity. At another level it recognizes
         the obligations shared by all profeesionals for a higher order of care
         for those effected by their work. And at a deeper level it recognizes
         several of those obligations which derive from the professional practice
         of software engineering. The clauses of each principle are illustrations
         of the the various levels of obligation included in that relationship.
         ==== Spirit not letter Although all levels of professional obligation
         are recognized, the code is not</p>
       <p align="justify">rather it is intended as a But not all inclusive....</p>
       <p align="justify">Because it expresses the consensus of the profession
         on ethical issues it can be used as a guide to decision making and as
         means to educate both the public and beginning professionals about their
         professional obligations . both prospective and existing members of a
         particular profession about the shared commitment of the members of a
         particular profession to undertake a certain quality work and the responsibility
         for the well being of the customer and user of the developed product.
         Guidance codes are only a partial representation of the ethical standards
         of the profession's members.(Anderson 1994, Gotterbarn 1996)</p>
       <p align="justify">not exhaustive list. They are not intended to be comprehensive
         some ideal and not always achievable-</p>
       <p align="justify"></p>
       <p align="justify"></p>
       <p align="justify"></p>
       <p align="justify"> By indicating the ehtical obligations in a particular
         relationship, constraint are placed on what others may ethically request
         of software engineers. The code helps to define those things which are
         ethically improper to request of an software engineer. The code also
         is designed to support l of support for the professional who decides
         to take positive action. They provide an environment in which it will
         be easier than it would otherwise be to resist pressure to do what the
         professional would rather not do.</p>
       <p align="justify">For an emerging profession, some of these functions
         are more critical than others. The choice of functions will give the
         code its own character. The support function is very important, because
         many software engineering projects are team projects and the software
         engineer is not always in a decision making position. Since the profession
         is an emerging one, the educational and inspirational functions are also
         important. </p>
       <p align="justify"></p>
       <p align="justify">STANDARD OF CONDUCT</p>
       <p align="justify">The standards set out below explain how the Code of
         Ethics applies to member's professional work. The list of standards is
         not necessarily exhaustive, and should not be read as definitively demarking
         the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical
         situations faced by a member. The intention of the Standard of Conduct
         is to illustrate, and to explain in more detail, the mean of the Code
         of Ethics in terms of specific behaviours. However, the mere fact that
         a member engages in, or does not engage in, these behaviours does not
         of itself guarantee that a member is acting ethically, or unethically,
         respectively.</p>
       <p align="justify">The ACS accepts that the standards are ideal, and many
         not all be achievable at all times in all circumstances. In practice,
         a member may occasionally find that some standards conflict with other
         standards, including standards from other sources. On these occasions
         the member must weight up the relevant factors and choose to act in the
         manner which is most consistent with the Codes of Ethics, given the circumstances.
         It is not possible to set totally objective standards about ethical conduct,
         and this Standard does not attempt to do so. The delineation of ethical
         and unethical behaviour requires some element of subjectivity. A member
         is expected to take into account the spirit of the entire Code in order
         to resolve ambiguous or contentious issues concerning ethical conduct.</p>
       <p align="justify">USE A PUBLIC STANDARD</p>
       <p align="justify"> In the final analysis the member is answerable to other
         members in jointly determining what is ethical and what is not in particular.
         In summary, a member is expected to act at all times in a manner likely
         to be judged by informed, respected, and experienced peers in possession
         of all of the facts as the most ethical way to act in the circumstances.</p>
       <p align="justify">========================</p>
       <p align="justify"> It is understood that some words and phrases in a code
         of ethics are subject to varying interpretations, and that any ethical
         principle may conflict with other ethical principles in specific situations.
         Questions related to ethical conflicts can best be answered by thoughtful
         consideration of fundamental principles, rather than reliance on detailed
         regulations.</p>
