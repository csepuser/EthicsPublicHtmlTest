      <p>1. Introductions and Logistics</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>This was the first meeting of the Software Engineering Coordinating Committee 
        (SWECC), a joint activity of the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society (CS). 
        The meeting began with self-introductions of all present:</p>
      <p>-- Leonard Tripp (Chair, CS)<br>
        -- Dennis Frailey (Co?chair, ACM)<br>
        -- Mark Ardis (SIGSOFT)<br>
        -- Doris Carver (CS Education)<br>
        -- Karl Reed (CS)<br>
        -- Laurie Werth (proxy for Linda Northrop, ACM Education)</p>
      <p>We agreed that important decisions of SWECC would be captured as &quot;Resolutions&quot;. 
        Each resolution would be prepared in written form by a sponsor. All resolutions 
        passed by SWECC would be published in the minutes. Creation and completion 
        of projects will be done by resolution. Other procedures for the committee 
        will unfold over time.</p>
      <p>Mark Ardis agreed to be the recorder for this meeting. Future recorders 
        will be chosen by self?nomination or rotation.</p>
      <p>Dennis Frailey proposed that we discuss inter?project coordination during 
        the &quot;New Business&quot; portion of the agenda. Other new business 
        items to be discussed were: cooperation with a Dagstuhl Workshop, and 
        conduct of workshops as publicity for SWECC.</p>
      <p>We agreed to the agenda as planned.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>2. Overview and History of SWECC Project<br>
        Leonard Tripp presented an overview of SWECC. (See slides in attachment 
        &quot;swecc oveview.pdf'.) The charter of the committee is to &quot;foster 
        and maintain software engineering as a professional computing</p>
      <p> <br>
        discipline&quot;. It was created as a joint effort of ACM and IEEE CS.</p>
      <p>Although some of the stimulus for the creation of SWECC was the recent 
        action of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers to license software 
        engineers, both technical societies consider SWECC to be an international 
        effort.</p>
      <p>The Executive Committee (EC) of SWECC consists of the attendees of this 
        meeting (except that Laurie Werth was attending as a proxy for Linda Northrop). 
        The EC is authorized to propose projects, such as the Software Engineering 
        Body Of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Project. However, the sponsoring technical 
        societies must approve all projects.</p>
      <p>Key events of SWECC are an annual activity report, an annual budget projection, 
        and an annual financial report. The EC will meet at least once per year, 
        with two meetings currently scheduled for 1999. The next meeting will 
        be held in Montreal, Canada, on July 13, 1999.</p>
      <p>A context diagram (slide 7 in attachment &quot;swecc oveview.pdf') relates 
        several proposed projects of SWECC:</p>
      <p>-- Guide to SWEBOK<br>
        -- SWE Model Curriculum<br>
        -- SWE Test Specification<br>
        -- SWE Code of Ethics</p>
      <p>The SWE Test Specification project will be a primary input to a software 
        engineering professional licensing examination. State agencies, such as 
        the Texas Board of Professional Engineers, conduct licensing. They rely 
        on technical societies to prepare test specifications for the body of 
        knowledge that is expected of examinees. In addition, they often require 
        that applicants receive a degree in their discipline from an accredited 
        program. Such programs will often follow a model curriculum posed by the 
        technical societies.</p>
      <p>Licensing varies from state to state, but most states use a similar process. 
        In order to be licensed each applicant must:</p>
      <p>-- obtain an appropriate bachelor's degree from an ABET accredited engineering 
        program</p>
      <p>-- pass a Fundamentals of Engineering exam, consisting of a morning exam 
        on general engineering topics, and an afternoon exam on a specialty area 
        (such as software engineering)</p>
      <p>-- spend at least four years practicing their discipline under the supervision 
        of a licensed engineer</p>
      <p> <br>
        -- apply for a license, including submission of references</p>
      <p>-- pass a specialty area exam, such as safety?critical applications.</p>
      <p>In practice, most states use an exam prepared by the National Council 
        of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES, http://ncees.orgL). 
        These exams are prepared from a set of Performance Norms that are supplied 
        by the appropriate technical societies. The American Society for Engineering 
        Education (ASEE, http://www.asee.orql) plays an important role in influencing 
        NCEES to create exams.</p>
      <p>We decided that coordinating and cooperating with organizations like 
        ASEE and NCEES was important to our effort.</p>
      <p>Leonard continued his presentation with some of the history of an earlier 
        version of SWECC begun in 1993. (See slides in attachment &quot;ieeeacmfvll.pdf'.) 
        Much of this history is contained in the Final Report of Joint IEEE Computer 
        Society and ACM Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering 
        as a Profession.</p>
      <p>One of the lessons from the earlier effort was that it required more 
        work than could be expected from volunteers only. That is, some support 
        for funding projects, such as the body of knowledge project, would be 
        needed.</p>
      <p>The earlier project had produced a useful draft of a code of ethics, 
        and it had started an effort to define an undergraduate curriculum. It 
        was recommended that these efforts continue to their logical completion. 
        It was also recommended that the effort continue to cooperate with the 
        Texas Board of Professional Engineers.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>3. Relationships between SWECC and others</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>We then proceeded to discuss the relationships between our effort and 
        organizations such as ASEE, NCEES, etc. The objective was to identify 
        liaisons between our activities and these other bodies. Although we started 
        to identify liaisons, we did not complete this task. Leonard Tripp took 
        an action item to prepare a list of liaisons by major categories for review 
        by the EC.</p>
      <p>A question that arose during our discussions was the possible certification 
        of specialties in software engineering. For example,</p>
      <p> <br>
        in medicine one first obtains a license to practice medicine, but additional 
        certifications to practice specialties (e.g., internal medicine, general 
        surgery, orthopedics) can be granted by the medical board. Might safety?critical 
        software be such a specialty deserving certification? Dennis Frailey took 
        an action item to prepare a white paper on this subject for review.<br>
        4. Plans<br>
        Our next topic was future plans for SWECC. Much of this discussion focussed 
        on the difficulties of preparing a description of a body of knowledge, 
        the mechanics of preparing licensing exams from such a description, and 
        the relationship of a model curriculum to these efforts.<br>
        The SWEBOK project is looking for funding from about ten organizations 
        that will serve as an Industry Advisory Board. Two of these organizations 
        are the ACM and the IEEE CS. The other participants would be industrial 
        sponsors who found value in the project. This will provide a check on 
        the relevance of the work. Almost all of the organizations have been identified 
        and have promised to support the effort.<br>
        Once the body of knowledge is identified, a set of performance norms (sample 
        questions) is prepared by volunteers. Such a project will be proposed 
        for SWECC when it is appropriate. Although the volunteers are not paid, 
        some modest living and travel expenses would be reimbursed. The future 
        project will have to identify a funding source for these expenses.</p>
      <p>In addition to SWEBOK, a project that SWECC wanted to start soon was 
        the development of a model curriculum for software engineering. We spent 
        some time discussing the objectives of such a project, and its relationships 
        to other activities.</p>
      <p>Dennis Frailey proposed two resolutions concerning the relationships 
        between a model curriculum project and the SWEBOK project. (See Resolution 
        1 &quot;Division of Responsibility between Body of Knowledge project and 
        Education project&quot; and Resolution 2 &quot;Cooperative activity between 
        SWEBOK and Education Projects&quot; at the end of these minutes.) Both 
        resolutions were passed by the EC. A white paper describing the motivation 
        for these resolutions is included as an attachment (&quot;white. doc&quot;).<br>
        Karl Reed proposed a resolution to the effect that any such model<br>
        5of11<br>
        7/26/2005 5:07 PM</p>
      <p> <br>
        curriculum contain the core content of software engineering. (See Resolution 
        3 &quot;Undergraduate Curriculum Model&quot;, at the end of these minutes.) 
        This resolution was passed by the EC.</p>
      <p>Finally, we discussed a document release process. It was agreed that 
        the Chair and Co?chair of the EC would issue reports, minutes and general 
        information about SWECC. Project deliverables, such as final reports, 
        would be issued by the EC.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>5. Overview of Software Engineering Standards</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Leonard Tripp gave an overview of software engineering standards activity 
        as introductory material for the SWEBOK discussion. (See attachment &quot;sesc.pdf'.) 
        Much of the SWEBOK effort has followed the same process as used by international 
        standards organizations.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>6. Report on SWEBOK Project</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Leonard Tripp gave a report on the SWEBOK project. (See attachments &quot;swebokprl.pdf' 
        and &quot;sweccjan2999.pdf'.) This project was started in December 1997 
        as a joint effort of the IEEE CS and the University of Quebec at Montreal. 
        As mentioned earlier, the SWEBOK will be used by the model curriculum 
        project and by the project that identifies performance norms for licensing. 
        It is also intended to be a resource of general use to many others, such 
        as practicing software engineers, students, and educators.</p>
      <p>The result of the first phase was a strawman version of a Guide to Software 
        Engineering Body of Knowledge. An Industry Advisory Board reviewed this 
        document and provided suggestions for the next phase of the project. One 
        of the main requests was to collapse a large set of Knowledge Areas (KAs) 
        down to a more reasonable number. The resulting list has ten items:</p>
      <p>-- Software Requirements Analysis<br>
        -- Software Design<br>
        -- Software Construction<br>
        -- Software Testing<br>
        -- Software Maintenance<br>
        -- Software Configuration Management<br>
        -- Software Quality Analysis<br>
        -- Software Engineering Management<br>
        -- Software Engineering Infrastructure</p>
      <p> <br>
        -- Software Engineering Process</p>
      <p>Karl Reed raised the issue of the role of the history of software engineering 
        in the proposed KAs. Mark Ardis took an action item to raise this issue 
        to SWEBOK.</p>
      <p>In the next phase a KA specialist will be selected to draft each KA description 
        (Version 0.1). Each description will include an overview of the area, 
        a set of performance norms, and a list of references. Each description 
        is expected to be about twenty pages long.</p>
      <p>A panel of experts will review the draft descriptions and make suggestions 
        for the next version (Version 0.5). Teams with specific focus (e.g., industrial 
        practice, education, standards) will review that version. Each focus team 
        will have a review captain who will be responsible for coordinating reviews 
        across all KAs. The result of editing to accommodate those reviews will 
        be Version 0.7. Finally, a large body of reviewers will participate in 
        the final review phase. This group will be selected along demographic 
        lines suggested by the members of the Industry Advisory Board. The last 
        version of the KAs produced after this review will be Version 0.9.</p>
      <p>The overall schedule for SWEBOK is:</p>
      <p>KA 0.1 -- 1st Quarter 1999</p>
      <p>KA 0.5 -- 2nd Quarter 1999</p>
      <p>KA 0.7 -- 3rd Quarter 1999</p>
      <p>KA 0.9 -- 4th Quarter 1999</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, funding for this project is provided by the Industry 
        Advisor Board. With ten equal shares of $30,000 each, the project appears 
        to be adequately funded.</p>
      <p>One of the concerns of EC members was the limited opportunity for participation 
        by knowledgeable members of the technical societies. It was agreed that 
        the panel of experts should include nominees from the technical societies. 
        Karl Reed and Mark Ardis took an action item to draft a list of experts 
        for the EC. In addition, the special review teams will include technical 
        reviewers captained by representatives of the technical societies.</p>
      <p>Since review plays an important role in the SWEBOK process, Karl Reed 
        took an action item to find suitable means of motivating reviewers to 
        participate. One mechanism for inviting reviewers will be to</p>
      <p> <br>
        publicize a call in ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes. Mark Ardis 
        took an action item to place a call in a future issue.</p>
      <p>Another concern was the interaction of the education community with the 
        SWEBOK effort. The resolutions brought forward by Dennis Frailey (see 
        resolutions 1 and 2) address many of these concerns, but there may be 
        other opportunities to cooperate. The educational representatives, Doris 
        Carver and Laurie Werth (acting for Linda Northrop), took an action item 
        to invite their respective organizations to participate in SWEBOK.</p>
      <p>The EC endorsed SWEBOK as a SWECC project.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>7. Responsibility Areas</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>We reviewed the main projects and other significant activities of SWECC 
        to assign each activity to at least one member of the EC. The following 
        assignments were identified:</p>
      <p>SWEBOK -- Leonard Tripp</p>
      <p>Education -- Dennis Frailey</p>
      <p>Publicity -- Karl Reed and Linda Northrop</p>
      <p>Liaison with Standards -- Leonard Tripp</p>
      <p>Liaison with National Bodies -- Leonard Tripp</p>
      <p>We expect other responsibilities to be identified after reviewing a more 
        complete liaison list.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>8. Future Plans</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The last items we discussed were the creation of a web page for SWECC, 
        and future meetings.</p>
      <p>Both technical societies have begun planning for the web page. A target 
        date of February 15 has been set for initial deployment. The first version 
        will have an introduction, a document register, and a brief description 
        of related activities. Later versions will include a history of activity 
        and a possible chat room.</p>
      <p> <br>
        A related issue of visibility is the production of letterhead and business 
        cards for SWECC. We noted an action item for this but failed to assign 
        it.</p>
      <p>We agreed to meet by teleconference during the week of April 12, 1999, 
        probably on the 13th or 14th. We also acknowledged that the next face?to?face 
        meeting would be in Montreal on July 13, 1999.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>9. Resolutions Passed by SWECC EC</p>
      <p><br>
        Resolution 1: Division of Responsibility between Body of Knowledge project 
        and Education project.</p>
      <p>Sponsor: Dennis J. Frailey</p>
      <p>The body of knowledge project and the education project shall divide 
        responsibilities for identifying the body of knowledge as follows:</p>
      <p>-- The BOK Project shall be responsible for the identifying the knowledge 
        areas that are unique to software engineers and, within each knowledge 
        area, identifying and providing reference material to definitive sources 
        on</p>
