                   <p align="justify">I am responding to the code of ethics. Overall, 
 
                     the code covers most of the areas concerning Software Engineers. 
 
                     I have a few questions on the code. Under PRINCIPLES v 2.1 
 
                     the statement &quot;free of error&quot; appears. Is there 
 
                     really any large software package that can be &quot;free of 
 
                     error?&quot; If so, I have not found it yet.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The other comment I have concerns what to 
 
                     do if problems arise. I know this code does not cover all 
 
                     possible scenarios, but problems are inevidable to occur during 
 
                     large projects. One solution may be to recursively use the 
 
                     code until the project is done.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Overall, good job. Codes of this nature are 
 
                     difficult to create and publish.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Thank you for your time,</p>

                   <p align="justify">COMMENTS ON THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ETHICS 
 
                     CODE </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">INTRODUCTION</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> The introduction agreeably establishes that 
 
                     the Software Engineering Ethics Code is a joint effort between 
 
                     the IEEE computer Society and ACM council members. It is appropriate 
 
                     that the individual authors that made up each of these groups 
 
                     is specified at the end of the Software Engineering Ethics 
 
                     Code. The third paragraph mentions several computing and engineering 
 
                     codes, which were used as references in this document. However, 
 
                     no where in this document was there reference to the specific 
 
                     parenthetically documented sources. Also in interest of these 
 
                     sources is the implicit question of which ethical theories 
 
                     are these based. For example, were these sources based on 
 
                     Kantian or Utilitarian principles.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">PREAMBLE v 2.1</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Paragraph III: There are three levels of 
 
                     ethical obligations that are listed in paragraph three and 
 
                     then described in later paragraphs. However, there is a deficit 
 
                     of pragmatic examples that could potentially identify and 
 
                     illustrate specific ethical obligations. In other words, it 
 
                     might be easier for the reader to relate to these generalizations 
 
                     if the reader could identify with them via the use of real 
 
                     life computer related scenarios.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">PRINCIPLES v 2.1</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> The lists of principles which are associated 
 
                     with keywords that are perhaps too extensive in number. Maybe 
 
                     some of these listed ideas would best be presented in paragraph 
 
                     format with the intent of enticing the readers desire mentally 
 
                     process this information. Each of the listed ideas could be 
 
                     elaborated upon so that examples might be included as part 
 
                     of the code.</p>
 
                   <p align="center">------- </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Dear Mr. Gotterbarn,</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">I am a senior undergraduate student here 
 
                     at the University of Wisconsin--Eau Claire. I am currently 
 
                     enrolled in Dr. David Nuesse's Ethics in Computer Science 
 
                     class. Yesterday Dr. Nuesse emailed our class a copy of the 
 
                     Software Engineering Ethics Code that you helped develop. 
 
                     He then asked us to provide some feedback to you on this Code 
 
                     of Ethics.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Let me begin by saying that I am very impressed 
 
                     by the detail and content of this Code. I feel that it is 
 
                     very complete and definitely an improvement upon the ACM Code 
 
                     of Ethics, which I feel at times is too general. One feature 
 
                     of the Software Engineering Ethics Code that I especially 
 
                     like is the different responsibilities and obligations that 
 
                     the software engineer has in the different roles that he/she 
 
                     may play.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">I think that my biggest complaint about the 
 
                     Software Engineering Ethics Code is that I do not feel it 
 
                     stresses that a software engineer should always work to achieve 
 
                     the highest quality possible in his/her work. The ACM Code 
 
                     of Ethics is very clear about this. I feel that trying to 
 
                     achieve perfection is very important and to accept less is 
 
                     unethical. This is why I feel that it is important that it 
 
                     be stressed that a software engineer needs to attempt to work 
 
                     at the highest level and not settle for anything less.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The other complaint that I have involves 
 
                     a topic covered in Dr. Nuesse's Ethics in Computer Science 
 
                     class. In his class, the issue of the right of privacy an 
 
                     employee has concerning his/her email would come up repeatedly. 
 
                     I was hoping that this Code you helped to develop would specifically 
 
                     address this issue and under what situations it is ethical 
 
                     or unethical. I guess I am especially concerned with this 
 
                     topic as in December I will be graduating and will be getting 
 
                     a job with a company where I perhaps will not have the privacy 
 
                     I seemingly have with my email right now. I know the Code 
 
                     states in Principle 5 (MANAGEMENT) that management is to &quot;assure 
 
                     that employees are informed of standards before being held 
 
                     to them (5.01)&quot; and &quot;assure employees know the employer's 
 
                     policies and procedures for protecting passwords, files, and 
 
                     other confidential information (5.02)&quot;. These two principles 
 
                     do address this topic somewhat, but I guess I was hoping for 
 
                     a more explicit policy towards email in the work place.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Now that I have shared my complaints about 
 
                     the Software Engineering Ethics Code with you, let me also 
 
                     share what I like best about the code. First of all, I like 
 
                     the idea expressed in the last set of principles that a software 
 
                     engineer needs to maintain competence. I feel that an education 
 
                     does not end with a degree and with a field involving the 
 
                     fast-changing world of computers, it is important to stay 
 
                     informed.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Secondly, I like the principles that you 
 
                     have developed about a software engineer's responsibilities 
 
                     to his profession. I feel that it is important to, as is stated 
 
                     in principle 6.13, &quot;share useful software-related knowledge, 
 
                     inventions, or discoveries with the profession, for example, 
 
                     by presenting papers at professional meetings, by publishing 
 
                     articles in the technical press, and by serving on the profession's 
 
                     standard-setting bodies.&quot; I also like the principle about 
 
                     a software engineer taking an active role in establishing 
 
                     an organizational environment that promotes ethical behavior.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Finally, I was glad to see some other concepts 
 
                     included in this Code that are missing from the ACM Code of 
 
                     Ethics. These include an emphasis on documentation and testing 
 
                     of software, and having qualified people work on a project. 
 
                     Other concepts I liked were that software engineers should 
 
                     warn the public about the dangers and risks associated with 
 
                     computers, and that management should not ask its employees 
 
                     to do something inconsistent with the Software Engineering 
 
                     Ethics Code.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In conclusion, I was very impressed with 
 
                     the Code you developed, and I hope that it is seen by many 
 
                     people and becomes an industry standard.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Thank you,</p>

                   <p align="justify">Don and Simon,</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Congratulations on your good work on the 
 
                     SE Code of Ethics. I liked the organization and the content. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">There is, however, one large omission. Those 
 
                     of us who do &quot;human factors&quot; research (e.g., user 
 
                     interface evaluation) often use human subjects in our tests. 
 
                     There should be a section in the code of ethics dealing with 
 
                     this specific area. Presumably, it would cover the standard 
 
                     issues in a fashion similar to medical ethics: informed consent, 
 
                     rights of the human subject, responsibilities of the experimenter, 
 
                     and confidentiality. It would also need to cover special issues 
 
                     like non-disclosure.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">If you like, I can take a crack at drafting 
 
                     a set of guidelines.</p>
