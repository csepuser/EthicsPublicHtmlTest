                   <p>Feline<br>
 
                     I tried to answer the concerns the best I could, hope it is 
 
                     OK. <br>
 
                     I think the change to a professional status will bring up 
 
                     this <br>
 
                     type of frustration from many people and maybe this individual 
 
                     <br>
 
                     is fighting it a little. I did not send my comments to the 
 
                     group; <br>
 
                     do you want me to? If there are additional comments like these 
 
                     maybe <br>
 
                     a meeting is in order to discuss the results.<br>

                     Could you address the comments made below?<br>
 
                     Some are tough and general, and perhaps they cannot be addressed.<br>
 
                     Yet the more pointed ones would be nice to clarify and fix.

                   <p>&gt;----------<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;Here are my comments on the proposed code of ethics.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;In general, I think this expresses some good ideals, but 
 
                     is entirely<br>
 
                     &gt;impractical in a number of cases. The problem is that 
 
                     many of the things <br>
 
                     &gt;being proposed are vaguely defined, impossible to accomplish, 
 
                     or<br>
 
                     &gt;not under the control of the software engineer. A few 
 
                     others might<br>
 
                     &gt;not be generally accepted as the &quot;right&quot; thing 
 
                     to do.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     First The SE Code of Ethics was built using other professional 
 
                     codes as <br>
 
                     models. Ethics doesn't have a practical/impractical side that 
 
                     I have ever<br>
 
                     experienced. Usually, ethics are vaguely defined and are not 
 
                     under any <br>
 
                     one groups control. I don't think that any of the items are 
 
                     impossible <br>
 
                     to do as a professional. Finally, I'll give 100 to 1 odds 
 
                     that under any <br>
 
                     professional code there are items that some will think are 
 
                     not the &quot;right&quot; <br>
 
                     thing to do. <br>
 
                     &gt;Specific comments and suggestions are identified below.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;INTRODUCTION<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;Computers now have a central and growing role 
 
                     in commerce, <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;industry, government, medicine, entertainment, 
 
                     and ordinary life. <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; Because the utility of computers depends in 
 
                     large part on the <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;instructions written for them, those who design, 
 
                     develop, and <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;test software have enormous opportunities both 
 
                     to do good and to <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, that 
 
                     this power will <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;be used for good, software engineers commit themselves 
 
                     to making <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;the design, development, and testing of software 
 
                     a distinct, <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance 
 
                     with that <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;commitment, software engineers shall adhere to 
 
                     the following <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;standards of conduct. The seven main paragraphs 
 
                     state general <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;rules. <br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;The following sentence makes no sense to me:<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;Each subsidiary clause is a specific application 
 
                     of its <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;general rule, one experience has shown needs 
 
                     express statement; <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;but no set of subsidiary clauses exhausts the 
 
                     general rule. <br>
 
                     General disclaimer saying we cannot give all instances of 
 
                     a rule in ethics.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;Rule 1: PRODUCT. Software engineers shall, insofar 
 
                     as possible, <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;assure that the software on which they work is 
 
                     useful to public, <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;employer, customer, and user, completed on time 
 
                     and at reasonable <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;cost, and free of significant error. In particular, 
 
                     software <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.01. Assure that specifications for software 
 
                     on <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; which they work have been put in writing, <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; satisfy the user's requirements, and have the 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; customer's approval.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;I see no reason why the ETHICS would require that specifications 
 
                     be<br>
 
                     &gt;put in writing. And I do not believe a software engineer 
 
                     is in a position<br>
 
                     &gt;to assure that specifications have met the other criteria. 
 
                     Examples:<br>
 
                     &gt;- you are brought in to fix something where you have(no) 
 
                     know knowledge<br>
 
                     &gt; of the history of its requirements<br>
 
                     &gt;- you are given the requirements by your organization 
 
                     and have no<br>
 
                     &gt; interface with the customer and do not know if the customer 
 
                     has <br>
 
                     &gt; approved<br>
 
                     Specs in writing could be put &quot;record specs&quot; but 
 
                     at present writing <br>
 
                     is the safest way of assuring transfer of data. The example 
 
                     given is <br>
 
                     one of the problems we are trying to decrease the occurrence 
 
                     of.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.02. Assure that they understand fully the 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; specifications for software on which they work.<br>
 
                     &gt;Would that this were true. It never is in practice. Things 
 
                     are gray here.<br>
 
                     Again, as professionals, another area we are trying to decrease 
 
                     the <br>
 
                     occurrence of. Shouldn't we strive for better specs and be 
 
                     unethical<br>
 
                     if we didn't.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.04. Assure proper goals and objectives for 
 
                     any <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; project on which they work.<br>
 
                     &gt;How can this be done? What is &quot;proper&quot;? By whose 
 
                     standards?<br>
 
                     There seems to be a contradiction here - if standards, companys/industry,<br>
 
                     exist then &quot;proper&quot; is defined. These are not difficult 
 
                     to do, although <br>
 
                     we don't, if we follow project manage techniques.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.05. Assure proper development methodology 
 
                     on any <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; project on which they work.<br>
 
                     &gt;Same question as above. <br>
 
                     See 1.04<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.06. Assure proper management on any project 
 
                     on <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; which they work, including proper procedures 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; for control of quality and risk.<br>
 
                     &gt;This is patently impossible. A software engineer is not 
 
                     in a position to<br>
 
                     &gt;assure anything about management unless they are the management.<br>
 
                     As any type of engineer I can assure proper mgmt of my responsible 
 
                     areas <br>
 
                     and shouldn't I report mismgmt.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.07. Assure proper estimates of cost, schedule, 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; personnel, and outcome on any project on <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; which they work.<br>
 
                     &gt;Once again, what is &quot;proper&quot; and notwithstanding 
 
                     that, how can a software<br>
 
                     &gt;developer assure this in practice? Chances are they were 
 
                     added to the<br>
 
                     &gt;project long after estimates were done.<br>
 
                     Another area we are trying to decrease the occurrence of.

                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.08. Assure adequate documentation on any project 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; on which they work, including a log of <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; problems discovered and solutions adopted.<br>
 
                     &gt;This is determined by company processes and procedures 
 
                     and policies and<br>
 
                     &gt;specific customer requirmenets, not by software engineers 
 
                     desires.<br>
 
                     What is the problem? Why shouldn't a professional add to these 
 
                     in areas <br>
 
                     of their expertise?<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.09. Assure proper testing, debugging, and 
 
                     review <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; of software and related documents on which <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; they work. <br>
 
                     &gt;What is &quot;proper&quot;?<br>
 
                     See 1.04<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.10. Assure that software and related documents 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; on which they work respect the privacy of <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; those who will be subject to the software.<br>
 
                     &gt;This is vague and untestable. Who will be &quot;subject 
 
                     to the software&quot;?<br>
 
                     &gt;What does it mean to &quot;respect the privacy&quot;?<br>
 
                     This is an ethics statement not a program being written. I 
 
                     don't think <br>
 
                     it is vague but an assurance that the SE thinks about the 
 
                     privacy issue.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.11 Assure that raw information used in software 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; is accurate, derives from a legitimate source,

                   <p><br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; and is used only in ways properly authorized. 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;Assurance may be difficult.<br>
 
                     It may be difficult but we owe it to the public and who we 
 
                     are doing the<br>
 
                     job for.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.12. Assure ethical, economic, cultural, legal, 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; and environmental issues are properly <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; identified, defined, and addressed.<br>
 
                     &gt;Few software engineers even know what these issues are.<br>
 
                     Then maybe they are not SEs and this is a goal we should be 
 
                     aiming for.<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.13. Promote maximum productivity and minimum 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; cost to employer, customer, user, and public.<br>
 
                     &gt;A nice ideal.<br>
 
                     Is the commentator saying we are not doing this now? Are we 
 
                     a group of<br>
 
                     cheats?<br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 1.14. Avoid fads, departing from standard <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; practices only when justified.<br>
 
                     &gt;This is a judgement call. Highly inappropriate in a code 
 
                     of ethics.<br>
 
                     Ethics is a set of principles or values that guide our judgments.<br>

                     &gt;&gt; &gt; that the software or related documents on <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; which they work may pose to the user, a third

                     &gt;&gt; &gt; party, or the environment.<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 2.02. Approve software only if they have a well-documented 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; belief that it is safe, meets specifications, 
 
                     and <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; has passed all appropriate tests.<br>
 
                     &gt;This is too arbitrary. Why must their belief be well documented? 
 
                     Doesn't<br>
 
                     &gt;this depend on the intended use of the software? Doesn't 
 
                     &quot;safety&quot; also<br>
 
                     &gt;depend on the intended use?<br>
 
                     Again 1.14 response; taken from PE Code. <br>
 
                     &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 2.03. Affix their signature only to documents 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; prepared under their supervision and within 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; their areas of competence.<br>
 
                     &gt;This would eliminate most documents one signs while seeking 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;employment, such as non-disclosure agreements and<br>

                     property<br>
 
                     &gt;rights agreements.<br>
 
                     I do not see what these examples have to do with Rule 2.<br>

                     I mean this.<br>
 
                     &gt;Who determines competence?<br>
 
                     The commentator paints a very bleak picture of our industry.<br>

                     &gt;&gt; &gt; 4.02. Assure that any document upon which they 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; rely has been approved by someone qualified 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt;&gt; &gt; to approve it.<br>
 
                     &gt;And how are they to determine the qualifications of the

                     &gt;approved a document that was prepared by another organization

                     &gt;I don't see why this is required for them to be ethical.<br>
 
                     &gt;Ditto for the rest of this section. Sounds more like what 
 
                     one would<br>
 
                     &gt;expect for them to get a license, not to be considered 
 
                     ethical.<br>
 
                     In the fastest growing field today, and perhaps in history, 
 
                     this is <br>
 
                     definitely an ethical issue. I have met too many people giving 
 
                     advice <br>
 
                     and guidance who I hope were not up to date and not just lying<br>
