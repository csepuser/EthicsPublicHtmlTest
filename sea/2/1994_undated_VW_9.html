       <p>Collected Thoughts for a Project on Ethics and Software Engineering <br>
   by Vivian Weil
       <p><br>
   Computers are integral to most enterprises in the private sector as well as
     in government and the military. The quality and reliability of software is
     therefore important. Observers were quick to notice that software resembles
     engineering products, though it also has attributes of literary products.
     It has taken longer to recognize good reasons for trying to train and organize
     creators of software as engineers. Once it becomes clear that creating software
     requires a systems approach, coding (programming) becomes a component of
     a process that begins with discovering the requirements for a new product
     and includes putting together specifications for a system, designing the
     system, testing, measuring its characteristics, and maintaining it. This
     systems approach is characteristic of engineering, as is the development
     of standards and systematic practices to ensure quality and reliability.
     Practitioners trained to take this approach and oriented towards meeting
     an appropriate standard of care would properly be regarded as engineers.
     However, the creation of software has not yet in many places become the disciplined
     process just described. The practitioners are too heterogeneous in their
     training and too undisciplined in their practices.</p>
       <p><br>
   Some observers have identified barriers that have kept creators of software
     from accepting responsibility for the safety, reliability, and utility of
     their products in the way expected of engineers. If this analysis is correct,
     there is a pressing need to remove the barriers that prevent software creators
     from becoming engineers in a full sense. In part the problem is intellectual:
     to conceptualize engineering aided by an understanding of how the practices
     of engineering develop. In part the problem is practical: to figure out how
     to support the development of systematic practices and appropriate standards
     for different domains, e.g. for life critical or mission critical software,
     and for different settings in companies and government agencies. Perhaps
     there should be a minimum standard for all software.</p>
       <p><br>
   There is a need then to deal with the question of software engineering. This
     would mean at least delineating the appropriate scientific knowledge, the
     body of techniques of design, and the organizational and managerial aspects
     of the role. That conceptual exercise is essential to dealing with the practical
     aspects of bringing an appropriate safety and reliability orientation into
     the creation of software. A project to facilitate the transition from haphazard
     ways of creating computer software to more disciplined engineering practices,
     friendly to creativity but oriented toward safeguarding against risks, would
     have to include contributions from a number of different sources. These sources
     include, in addition to computer science: history and philosophy of engineering,
     ethics, law (with regard to liability), private (and government?) sector
     employers, and professional societies. The project would include an examination
     of models of a systems approach to developing software for their applicability
     in different contexts and for the distinctive responsibilities they generate.
     The products of the project would be an exemplar of a code of professional
     responsibility designed for software engineers that includes its rationale,
     and a handbook of ethics problems and cases with commentary. These, together
     with initiatives the project would instigate in professional societies, would
     be designed to accelerate the professionalization of software creators.</p>
