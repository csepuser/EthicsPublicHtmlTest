                   <p>This is a long message. Items that require action on your
                     part are preceded by the symbol &quot;&raquo;&quot;.</p>
                   <p>We are happy to report that the ACM and the IEEE-Computer 
 
                     Society have approved, at their respective Fall board meetings, 
 
                     a replacement structure for the Joint committee and its task 
 
                     forces. Effective January 1, 1999, the Joint Committee and 
 
                     its task forces are dissolved and, in their place, there will 
 
                     be a new entity called the Software Engineering Coordinating 
 
                     Committee (SWECC), and a corresponding set of projects.</p>
 
                   <p> &raquo; 1) Please pass this information on to your respective 
 
                     task force members.</p>
 
                   <p> &raquo; 2) Please provide us a list of your task force members 
 
                     so we can request that their respective societies acknowledge 
 
                     their work in an appropriate fashion.</p>
 
                   <p>SWECC consists of a chair (Leonard, representing the CS BOG), 
 
                     vice chair (Dennis, representing the ACM Council and EC), 
 
                     and two other representatives from each society. The ACM representatives 
 
                     are Mark Ardis (representing SIGSOFT and the technical community) 
 
                     and Linda Northrup (representing the Education board and the 
 
                     education community). CS representatives are Karl Reed (representing 
 
                     TCSE and the technical community) and Doris Carver (representing 
 
                     the Education Activities board and the education community). 
 
                     Both the ACM Council and the Computer Society Board of Governors 
 
                     have expressed a strong interest in knowing about the activities 
 
                     of SWECC and its projects.</p>
 
                   <p>SWECC is jointly owned by the two societies and it will function 
 
                     In several roles. Among them are:</p>
 
                   <p>- coordination of related activities.<br>
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Also produced were a model set of accreditation standards 
 
                     and several presentations and panels on the subject of software 
 
                     engineering as a profession. SWECC is a permanent, successor 
 
                     entity to the Joint Steering Committee that will take these 
 
                     efforts into a completion, deployment, and ongoing support 
 
                     phase.</p>
 
                   <p>For further information on SWECC, contact the chairman, Leonard 
 
                     Tripp of Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. (Leona rd.Tripp@PSS.Boeing.com), 
 
                     or the Vice Chairman, Dennis Frailey of Raytheon Systems Company 
 
                     (D-Frailey@ti.com).</p>
 
                   <p>End of Press Release<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     intend to retain the key individuals from each task force 
 
                     and to provide a mechanism by which their activities can achieve 
 
                     more impact. To that end, &gt; &gt; 3) we are requesting that 
 
                     you, as leaders of the current task forces, prepare project 
 
                     proposals to be reviewed by SWEEP. Further details for each 
 
                     of your areas can be discussed separately, although some general 
 
                     guidelines are listed below.</p>
 
                   <p>SWEEP. plans to meet twice a year in person (winter and summer) 
 
                     and regularly between such meetings by email and/or web forums. 
 
                     Thus proposals you prepare can be discussed informally with 
 
                     us in an electronic fashion and can even be approved and forwarded 
 
                     to the sponsoring societies in that fashion. The first meeting 
 
                     of SWEEP. will occur on January 28 and 29, 1999 in Austin, 
 
                     Texas. The primary purpose of this meeting will be to organize 
 
                     SWEEP. so we do expect to hear full reports or full proposals 
 
                     from your task forces. However we would like to hear an abbreviated 
 
                     report from each task force (it need not be in person, since 
 
                     agenda time will be slim). &gt; &gt; 4) Please prepare a brief 
 
                     report summarizing 1998 activities and future project plans, 
 
                     including strategies to be used for achieving your objectives. 
 
                     Please submit this report electronically. If you have a representative 
 
                     who resides in the area (for example, Laurie Werth of the 
 
                     education activity resides in Austin), we could meet with 
 
                     them briefly on the afternoon of the 28th to discuss your 
 
                     report, but the small amount of time we expect to have would 
 
                     not justify long distance travel just for this purpose.</p>
 
                   <p>Code of Ethics and Professional Practice: Both societies 
 
                     have approved the code of ethics, so our understanding is 
 
                     that the primary objective of a project at this point will 
 
                     be to maintain this code and to evolve it as more professional 
 
                     practice elements can be established.</p>
 
                   <p>Education: The education boards of both societies have endorsed 
 
                     your proposed accreditation criteria and we understand that 
 
                     CSAB/ABET will make use of these as it develops detailed procedures 
 
                     for accreditation of software engineering programs. We would 
 
                     like a proposal for an education project that addresses curriculum 
 
                     matters, and we encourage you to consider some kind of joint 
 
                     activity with the Working Group for Software Engineering Education, 
 
                     chaired by Nancy Mead of SEI and Tom Hilburn of ERAU, whose 
 
                     work seems to dovetail well with your own. For example, David 
 
                     Parnas has recently suggested a workshop on software engineering 
 
                     curriculum issues that would be jointly organized by your 
 
                     activity, the working group, and possibly others working in 
 
                     that area. This is the kind of activity that SWECC would support.</p>
 
                   <p>Proposals:<br>
 
                     Proposals, need to address the following issues in order to 
 
                     Satisfy the requirements of the two societies: - summary of 
 
                     the project's goals and objectives - the expected duration 
 
                     of the project<br>
 
                     - the expected outcome / deliverables of the project - the 
 
                     planned process for achieving the desired results - expected 
 
                     intermediate milestones and proposed reporting dates (to SWECC 
 
                     and the societies)<br>
 
                     - the proposed management and governance structure, including 
 
                     names of key individuals involved<br>
 
                     - a budget that shows the total cost for the project, and 
 
                     how the money will be spent each year.<br>
 
                     - an indication of where the money will come from and in what 
 
                     fiscal years it will be needed.</p>
 
                   <p>Funding:<br>
 
                     - SWECC will not have significant funds for direct project 
 
                     support. However because of its oversight and sponsorship 
 
                     role, each project will provide a financial report to SWECC 
 
                     on an annual basis. The SWECC fiscal year runs from July 1 
 
                     through June 30, thus financial reports will be due at its 
 
                     summer meeting.<br>
 
                     - for relatively small projects (roughly, under $10K/year), 
 
                     it is likely that each society or its sub-units would provide 
 
                     the funding, although this is not a requirement. For example, 
 
                     an education project might solicit funds from the respective 
 
                     education boards or corresponding special interest groups 
 
                     or technical committees<br>
 
                     - for larger projects, sponsorship should be solicited from 
 
                     such sources as: - society SIGs or TCs . government funding 
 
                     agencies such as NSF or NIST . business and industry sources<br>
 
                     To illustrate, the BOK project will have roughly 10% of its 
 
                     budget covered by each of the societies and the remainder 
 
                     from industry and government sources</p>
 
                   <p>Management and Governance<br>
 
                     - SWECC will normally expect to review annual progress reports 
 
                     from each project at its Winter meeting and to see intermediate 
 
                     progress electronically at appropriate<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     milestones. Another option for a major project is a special 
 
                     review event.   The management of each project will vary, 
 
                     depending on the size. At a minimum, there should be at least 
 
                     two individuals, one from each society, who manage the project 
 
                     and whose duties include reporting to their respective society 
 
                     about project status and progress. One of these individuals 
 
                     should also report regularly to SWECC, as previously described. 
 
                       larger projects that solicit funds from industry and other 
 
                     sources are likely to include one or more advisory boards. 
 
                     For example, the BOK project has an industrial advisory board. 
 
                     Such boards provide representation, expertise, and may possibly 
 
                     also provide individuals to participate in projects.  projects 
 
                     may elect to have panels of experts to provide expert review 
 
                     and evaluation of their activities. A panel of experts, for 
 
                     example, was used very successfully to review the code of 
 
                     ethics. This mechanism assures that the results have high 
 
                     credibility.</p>
