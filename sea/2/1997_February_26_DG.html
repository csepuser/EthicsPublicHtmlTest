       <p> Don, the committee did not have its conference call because some people 
         got fouled up again. But here are my comments on what you sent. I may 
         send more than one part because you sent 5 parts.</p>
       <p>&gt; Deliverables from the SEEPP Task Force.<br>
         &gt; Attached below please find:<br>
         &gt; 1. A proposed schedule for the development of the Code<br>
         &gt; and other documents.<br>
         I think this is OK.<br>
         For planning purposes, why not assume this until further input from ACM 
         Council and/or the Steering committee.</p>
       <p>&gt; 2. The revised task force structure<br>
         Also seems fine with me except it is not clear who will do all the work.<br>
         Is it you and the two people reporting to you who will do most of it?</p>
       <p>&gt; 3. A document describing the roles and functions of codes of<br>
         &gt; ethics and the implications of these for the Code.<br>
         I think this is more comprehensive than either the ACM Council or the 
         steering committee expected. It remains to be seen what they will say. 
         I think it looks OK, but they might not want you to do something so comprehensive.</p>
       <p>&gt; 4. A document concerning the architecture of the code and<br>
         &gt; its origins. The document has an assoicated table sent a<br>
         &gt; email message 5. Email 5 contains an ASCII text table. <br>
         &gt; The section of the document containing the table must be<br>
         &gt; printed using a mono-space font, like courier, so that the<br>
         &gt; table lines up.<br>
         I am going to try to boil this down for presentation to Council and the 
         Steering committee.</p>
       <p>You will probably be invited to a steering committee meeting in May or 
         so.</p>
       <p>&gt; 5. A second version of the code.<br>
         I have not had time to go through this, nor have other committee members.<br>
         We will not give you guidance by the 28th, I'm sorry to say, but I would 
         suggest you go ahead assuming no major problems unless there is a big 
         deal expenditure coming up right away.</p>
       <p>&gt; 6. The working papers indicating every change that was<br>
         &gt; made to version 1.0 of the code and why those changes<br>
         &gt; were made. This document is broken up into three email<br>
         &gt; messages.<br>
         See comment on #5.</p>
       <p>&gt; PROPOSED SCHEDULE AND TASK FORCE STRUCTURE v.1.0<br>
         &gt; <br>
         &gt; of practice is tied to the progress of the other task forces.<br>
         The body of knowledge task force is not likely to have progressed beyond 
         a second, more comprehensive survey having been sent out and analyzed. 
         The potential impact on you would seem to be mainly in the area of scope. 
         The education task force will not have done anything.</p>
       <p>Here are MY comments on the schedule. Not approved by anyone else on 
         the<br>
         committee yet, but I will copy to Felipe.</p>
       <p>&gt; 28 February <br>
         &gt; Steering committee:<br>
         &gt; Return Code v2 with comments to the task force.<br>
         Don't expect before April or May if you want anything substantive.<br>
         &gt; Return comments on any other documents<br>
         Ditto.<br>
         &gt; Indicate commitment to this schedule<br>
         See above.</p>
       <p>&gt; - booking space in society publications for publication of <br>
         &gt; draft code and ballot/survey in September issues<br>
         This will depend on outcome of ACM and IEEE governing bodies' reactions. 
         I would not expect space to be booked that soon. More like early 1998. 
         I will make this an issue at the ACM Council meeting.</p>
       <p>&gt; - support of web site at CCSR<br>
         Will make an agenda item for steering committee.<br>
         &gt; - support of announcement in society publications of<br>
         &gt; existence of web site and invitation to comment<br>
         Ditto.<br>
         &gt; - permission to publicize this schedule to task force<br>
         I can give you unofficial approval to publicize it as a working draft.<br>
         &gt; <br>
         &gt; 1 March<br>
         &gt; Task Force begins addressing steering committee concerns and<br>
         &gt; continues revision of the code.<br>
         Will need to be delayed until May I think.<br>
         &gt; <br>
         &gt; Establish a web site at Centre for Computing and Social<br>
         &gt; Responsibility on behalf of the ACM and IEEE-CS for<br>
         &gt; development and dissemination of the Code. CCSR has<br>
         &gt; significant international email lists and it is where I am working<br>
         &gt; during the development of the code. The web site could be<br>
         &gt; managed by them and then turned over to the societies at the end<br>
         &gt; of the project.<br>
         I need to know the long term financial implications.<br>
         &gt; <br>
         &gt; 1 April<br>
         &gt; Revised Code and working papers to Steering Committee<br>
         Shoot for August, maybe.<br>
         &gt; <br>
         &gt; 15 April<br>
         &gt; Place draft copy of Code on to web site for general comment.<br>
         Ditto. They may approve putting the current v2 on for comment. That could 
         be done in April.<br>
         &gt; <br>
         &gt; 1 June <br>
         &gt; Completion of Code and associated documents for review by<br>
         &gt; Steering Committee.<br>
         &gt; Begin preparation of survey instrument for Code.<br>
         I think this needs to be planned for the Fall.<br>
         &gt; <br>
         &gt; 15 June<br>
         &gt; Revisit documents in light of Steering Committee comments<br>
         Ditto.<br>
         &gt; 30 June <br>
         &gt; Finish revisions<br>
         Ditto.<br>
         &gt; 4 July <br>
         &gt; Survey/ballot prepared<br>
         &gt; Code revised in light of all of the above<br>
         &gt; Document prepared for publication which requires 2 month lead<br>
         &gt; time for publication<br>
         I figure this in November or so, assuming societies want to proceed with 
         this. Should be settled in early Fall.<br>
         &gt; <br>
         I think everything after this point needs to be planned for in 1998, assuming 
         the prior things go well and the societies want to take these next steps. 
         Suggest you concentrate on getting the code in shape for sending out for 
         comments, both from the steering committee and the profession at large. 
       </p>
       <p>Sorry for the uncertainties here. We have been concentrating on getting 
         survey analysis done and the committee, as you know, has a hard time getting 
         a lot of time together.</p>
       <p>===================================================================<br>
         items below I recommend keeping as plan for 1998, pending positive signals 
         from sponsors and steering committee.</p>
       <p>&gt; 1 August<br>

         &gt; methods and techniques to support and disseminate the<br>
         &gt; code<br>

         &gt; applying the Code in decision making)<br>

         &gt; Send proposals for changes to task force.<br>
         &gt; <br>
         &gt; 15-31 October<br>
         &gt; Ballots on proposed revisions received from task force and<br>
         &gt; continued discussion with task force and steering committee<br>

         &gt; Prepare and deliver the approved Code for publications in the<br>
         &gt; societies' publications and web sites.<br>
         &gt; Present Code and papers on this work at professional conferences,<br>
         &gt; including the CSEE&amp;T and ICSE. <br>
         &gt; Write up, package, and deliver articles for publication.<br>
         &gt; Finalize work on Code of Ethics, examples of Conduct.<br>
         &gt; Begin work on additional special area papers <br>
         &gt; <br>
         =======================================================================<br>
         &gt; BUDGET for 1997<br>
         &gt; Based on 3 person months of voluntary work by the Executive<br>
         &gt; committee.<br>
         &gt; Establishment and maintenance of web site at CCSR for duration<br>
         &gt; of project $1000.<br>
         This will cost $500/society. I will see if I can get you an answer<br>
         on this sooner. The rest seems quite reasonable.</p>
       <p>&gt; Two meetings for Executive committee @ $1,800 <br>
         &gt; $3600<br>
         &gt; One Meeting with Chair of task force <br>
         &gt; 600<br>
         &gt; Printing costs- page costs etc, determined by societies involved.
