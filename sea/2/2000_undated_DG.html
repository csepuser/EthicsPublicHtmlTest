       <p>I. The Beginning- Identifying a need and how to address it. SEEPP was
         following an IEEE model of developing a standard. In retrospect this
         had two problems. One the process is very drawn out and depends on multiple
         groups of otherwise busy volunteers. The only SEEPP task force leader
         who knew anything about this process did not have enough time to devote
         to the project.</p>
       <p>A. A need was identified 1993 *May IEEE-CS Board of Governors in response
         to Fletcher Buckley proposal- distributed earlier Profesisoalize SE *Fall
         ACM Separately forms a &#8220;Commission on Software Engineering to address
         a number of questions related to 1) the terminology used to describe
         software engineering and those who work in the software area; 2) identify
         generally accepted and desired standards of good software practice; and
         3) determine our ability to identify, educate, and train individuals
         who are competent with software engineering and design.&#8221;</p>
       <p>*ACM joins effort Ad hoc committee formed</p>
       <p>Report to BOG from steering committee (11/12/93)- cite May meeting in
         Baltimore Meeting schedule plan from 1/29/94 Following IEEE Standards
         Board Project Authorization Request</p>
       <p>1994---- 29 Jan ?? Don Gotterbarn and Bob Melford meet in Pittsburgh
         with Mario Barbacci and plan the approach to the ethics portion of the
         process. The IEEE working model was adopted. This model sets up a task
         force of working group leaders. The members of the working groups do
         the work and report back to the task force. At this meeting a schedule
         was laid out based on the delivery of a product that was not clearly
         defined, but the method would be to follow the IEEE model. Melford was
         the one familiar with this methodology and started to put together the
         Call For Participation which would comply with IEEE standards.</p>
       <p> January 1994, the president of the IEEE-CS made a proposal to the ACM
         to form a Joint Steering Committee to accomplish these goals.</p>
       <p> 4/30 Washington Meeting of some SEEP task force members after CEI Meeting
         April 30, 1994 - plan to rely on multiple focus groups and surveys: List
         task force by roles- partial list of attendees. Robert Melford, Don Gotterbarn,
         Steve Barber, Joyce Currie Little, Patrick Sullivan, and Fletcher Buckley
         and Suzie Weisband on conference call ( This was the last participation
         by Wiesband) Task Melford would write a draft using IEEE format for operations
         of working groups (4/94) and finish CFP</p>
       <p>Steering Committee in Pittsburgh May 28 1994 Steering committee members-
         Larry Druffel, Barry Boehm, Elliot Chikofsky and others- Those familiar
         with IEEE document procedures where recommended against following the
         whole elaborate procedure since it was too time consuming- 5- 7 years.
         Gotterbarn and Melford meet with committee, major issue of discussion
         was a press release about SEEPP making a presentation at a congressional
         briefing in late June 1994.</p>
       <p> Boston Meeting June 11, 1994 Met at Boston College, father Mike McFarland
         hosting &#8211; attending, McFarland, Gotterbarn Melford, Joyce Curry
         Little, Keith Miller. Patrick Sulivan and Suzie Weisband on conference
         call at this time the final 8 groups were decided upon Divide into groups
         draft of Working Group CFP- Institutional support Mike McFarland, professional
         competence D. Gotterbarn, intellectual property, Suzanne Weisband and
         Steve Barber, Professional relations-Joyce Curry Little, Privacy Patrick
         Sullivan, Reliability and Safety-Keith Miller, Security- Bob Melford,
         social justice- Suzanne Weisband. </p>
       <p> Fax- Aug 24/94 Bob revise CFP again Minutes June 11 meeting-(8/28/94)-
         set November 1995 as completion date Announcement of initiative in TCSE
         (9/94)</p>
       <p>Request CFP Comments from group leaders so Don can Launch by 9/1 (CFPdraft)
         Few comments &#8211;Don uncomfortable with delays launches the CFP CFP
         final release October 1994- Must return by 5 November 1994</p>
       <p>Plan to organize working groups in November of 1994 &#8211; target to
         get working group materials to task force by November 1995- Task Force
         would then rework and organize final materials. Mid November Don sends
         list of volunteers who responded to CFP to working group leaders who
         were to organize mailing lists for their groups and organize their group&#8217;s
         work. [ Aside- as far as I can tell this was only done by Keith Miller
         and Don Gotterbarn]</p>
       <p>- delay introduce by Melford for need a written standard for Working
         Group operations.</p>
       <p>Mario Task force overhead (12/94)</p>
       <p> B. Trying to motivate activity- Requests for clearance from steering
         committee, apparent confusion about goals and support from steering committee.
         Some on the committee wanted a standard practices document. A document
         which was something like &#8220;When you are faced with this particular
         situation this is the technical approach.&#8221; Others wanted a broader
         approach.</p>
       <p>1995 Meeting with steering committee in Nashville along with ACM meeting-
         (2/27/95) ? June ? Sept/Oct nothing Nov Dec emails- Are we still working
         Dec 1995 email Mention meeting in March- which march</p>

       <p>Plan to D. Frailey, as requested at February ACM- spoke about ACM canceling
         support for us. Also attached Keith&#8217;s out line of task force plan-
         Last time Melford involved. (2/14-17/96). Each Group was to develop a
         draft standard. Hold up was nothing from other society- how cover the
         skill set until the skills task force had done its work </p>
       <p>Feb- Gotterbarn request to competence group to brainstorm standards
         Request to each working group to start. </p>
       <p>April Mechler list called final</p>

         had seven principles Feb- March significant revisions of Preamble- later
         discover that emphasis on three levels of ethics casued problems because
         everyone wanted the code clauses to be assigned to a specific level.</p>
       <p> Told by Steering not to publish without their approval- All drafts
         would have attached a disclaimer by the steering committee that this
         was just a draft- Feldman from the steering committee was in charge of
         writing this document.</p>
