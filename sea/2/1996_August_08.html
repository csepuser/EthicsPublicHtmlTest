       <p>CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS</p>
       <p>INTRODUCTION </p>
       <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, industry,
         government, medicine, entertainment, and ordinary life. Because the utility
         of computers depends in large part on the instructions written for them,
         those who design, develop, and test software have enormous opportunities
         both to do good and to cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, that
         this power will be used for good, software engineers commit themselves
         to making the design, development, and testing of software a distinct,
         beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance with that commitment,
         software engineers shall adhere to the following standards of conduct.
         The seven main paragraphs state general rules. Each subsidiary clause
         is a specific application of its general rule, one which experience has
         shown needs express statement; but no set of subsidiary clauses exhausts
         its'general rule. </p>
       <p>Rule 1: PRODUCT. Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, assure
         that the software on which they work is useful to public, employer, and
         user, completed on time and at reasonable cost, and free of significant
         error. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate: </p>
       <p>1.01. Assure that they understand fully the specifications for software
         on which they work. </p>
       <p>1.02. Assure that they are qualified for any project on which they work. </p>
       <p>1.03. Assure proper goals and objectives for any project on which they
         work. </p>
       <p>1.04. Assure proper development methodology on any project on which
         they work, including proper procedures for quality control.</p>
       <p>1.05. Assure proper management on any project on which they work. </p>
       <p>1.06. Assure proper estimates of cost, schedule, personnel, and outcome
         on any project on which they work. </p>
       <p>1.07. Assure proper testing, debugging, and review of software on which
         they work. </p>
       <p>1.08. Assure proper documentation on any project on which they work. </p>
       <p>1.09. Assure that software on which they work respects the privacy of
         those who will be subject to it. </p>
       <p>1.10. Assure ethical, economic, cultural, legal, and environmental issues
         are properly identified, defined, and addressed. </p>

         tests. </p>
