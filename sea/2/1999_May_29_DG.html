       <p align="justify">Dear Dennis and Leonard:</p>
       <p align="justify"> The Software Engineering Professional Ethics Project
         has been working on some of the project tasks. We have completed the
         preliminary design of the flyer to be distributed to the memberships
         of the two societies announcing the Code. The SEPEP committee thought
         it would be useful if the flyer could serve a dual role. First, it serves
         to alert the members to the adoption of the Code and their consequent
         commitment to it. One side of the flyer makes this announcement and includes
         some background on the Code legitimizing it as an international consensus
         document of the constituencies of both societies. The other side of the
         flyer is designed to be used as a &#8220;mini-poster&#8221; which can
         be placed as a reminder of critical elements of the Code in work environments,
         placed on university bulletin boards, or framed. The &#8220;mini-poster&#8221; has
         the some of the ideas we think are important and the order in which we
         want them presented. We will need help with polishing the design of the
         min-poster.</p>
       <p align="justify"> Please let us know how we proceed with the production
         and distribution of the flyer/mini-poster. Who are the society contacts
         I should be working with. Thanks for your help.</p>
       <p align="justify">Sincerely,</p>
       <p align="justify"> Don Gotterbarn, Keith Miller, Simon Rogerson </p>
       <p align="justify">Software Engineering&#8217;s Code of Ethics Software
         Engineering now has its own code of ethics. The Code was adopted as the
         standard for practicing and teaching Software Engineering by both the
         ACM and the IEEE-Computer Society in 1998.</p>
       <p align="justify"> Relevance and Importance of the Code This Code educates
         and inspires Software Engineers, and educates the public about the responsibilities
         that are important to and accepted by the profession. This Code instructs
         practitioners about the standards that society expects them to meet and
         what their peers strive for and expect of each other. The Code offers
         practical advice about issues that matter to professionals and their
         clients and it serves to inform policy makers about ethical constraints
         imposed on software engineers.</p>
       <p align="justify"> Content of the Code The Code is structured around eight
         themes: Public, Client and Employer, Product, Judgment, Management, Profession,
         Colleagues, and Self. The ethical principles written on those themes
         embody the ethical obligations of all of the professional relationships
         entered into by a Software Engineer. The Code recognizes that the primary
         ethical responsibility is to the Public. The Code concerns itself several
         aspects of Software Engineering including management, development, maintenance
         and education.</p>
       <p align="justify"> Consensus on Ethical Standards In successive reviews
         the Code received overwhelming support both in its structure and content.
         In November 1997 the Code was presented in Communications of the ACM
         and Computer with a turn-around ballot to encourage comments from the
         membership&#8217;s of both societies. Some modifications were made and
         circulated for additional comment. The Code was then submitted to the
         IEEE formal technical review process under the leadership of Leonard
         Tripp. It successfully passed this rigorous process. It was unanimously
         adopted by the ACM Council and the Computer Society the Board of Governors.
         Several major companies have subsequently adopted the Code and its principles
         have been incorporated into their standards of practice. </p>
       <p align="justify"> International Perspective The code was developed by
         volunteers drawn from all the continents of the world. There were contributions
         from members of the professional societies of several countries. The
         participation of this broad-based group has led to a code that represents
         an international agreement that assists in unifying the profession. This
         is a landmark in software engineering.</p>
       <p align="justify"> Further Work Both societies are supporting the professionalism
         of Software Engineering by establishing the Software Engineering Professional
         Ethics Project. The focus of this project will be to make the Code an
         effective practical instrument. Those interested in participating in
         this project and companies interested in adopting the Code or incorporating
         it into their standards of practice should contact Don Gotterbarn (gotterba@etsu.edu).</p>
