      <p> <strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>I have a bachelor&#8217;s degree from the University 
        of Illinois in music education (1965). I have a master&#8217;s degree 
        in electrical and computer engineering from UC-Santa Barbara (1980) and 
        a master&#8217;s in systems management (USC, 1987). And I have Ph.D. work 
        in &quot;Computers, Organizations, Policy and Society&quot; (an interdisciplinary 
        program at the UC-Irvine) in the late 1987-1990. 
      <p><br>
        <strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do there?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>I work for California State University, Long Beach, 
        which is a university. I&#8217;m in the Department of Computer Science. 
        My own specialty is databases and web design development. </p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>Assembly language in the 1970s. I had a 20-year career 
        in the U.S. Air force (1967-1987). Writing assembly language was not in 
        my job description, but it was necessary. So that&#8217;s how I started&#8230;that 
        was my first introduction to software. A lot of people try to convince 
        me that music and computers are somehow very compatible fields. They might 
        be right. But that&#8217;s not how I got into it. I just happened to have 
        to deal with a computer&#8212;the only way to deal with it was to talk 
        to it in assembly language. And so, that&#8217;s what I did. It wasn&#8217;t 
        my job&#8230;it was needed to keep my job running. The degree in computer 
        science came much later. Yes, I am self-taught.</p>
      <p>During my time in the military, I was involved in software development&#8212;everything 
        from user, to test conductor, to systems manager. I ended up as a project 
        manager, not of software particularly but of development of programs. 
        That&#8217;s why I have a degree in systems management. I became involved 
        in software development during its early stages, not as a developer but 
        as a manager and evaluator of requirements processes. </p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TJ: </strong>In the sense of am I a P.E&#8230;no. With a small 
        e, the answer is sure. In terms of engineering as a discipline requiring 
        problem solving&#8212;yes. After all, I have a degree in engineering. 
        So I guess entitled to claim that I am a &#8220;small e&#8221; engineer.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>Starting in 1996, I became editor of the Computers 
        &amp; Society, the publication of ACM&#8217;s Special Interest Group on 
        Computers and Society (SIGCAS). I&#8217;d been a member of SIGCAS prior 
        to that; I&#8217;d go to conferences and things. But in 1996 I was appointed 
        editor of its publication. I was editor for 5 year. Last year, I was became 
        chairman of SIGCAS. As editor, everything dealing with computer and society 
        issues would have crossed my path some way or another. I knew Don Gotterbarn; 
        I had met him at conferences. We were friends and colleagues. And, as 
        editor, I also printed a number of articles that were by Don, Don and 
        Keith Miller, or Don and Dianne Martin, or whoever (e.g., Deborah Johnson). 
        And so, obviously, I published a number of articles related to SEEPP. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>Again, it was strictly as a result of my being editor. 
        Don and the others were putting together the task force. I joined them. 
        That was around 1996, I think. Basically, I was asked to participate because 
        of my position as editor. </p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>Certainly. I was familiar with the ACM code of ethics. 
        But my most important experience with a code of ethics was as an Air Force 
        officer. <br>
        <strong><br>
        8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>I was a reviewer&#8230;I got drafts&#8230;For the 
        most part, I was one of dozens of people that regularly got revisions. 
        I was an editor, just an editor. I don&#8217;t recall making any suggestions 
        that were not editorial. </p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>Email&#8230;that&#8217;s all. Yes, I did attend conferences. 
        But that&#8217;s about it. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>Since there weren&#8217;t any others, it&#8217;s 
        hard to compare. The conferences were effective, though. I do think that 
        e-mail is becoming useless, because of all the spam, but spam was not 
        a problem when the code was being written.</p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>No.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>Other than what&#8217;s been published, which I just 
        gave you a copy of (Computers &amp; Society, January 1998), no. Do I have 
        personal things? No. There probably isn&#8217;t a lot of material to go 
        from. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?<br>
        </strong><br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>No. I do think the code&#8217;s important; but I&#8217;ve 
        always thought itwas important. And uhm, I still think it&#8217;s important. 
        Maybe even more so. </p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?<br>
        </strong><br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>Lots of things. Let&#8217;s take one example. I could 
        go back to my military days. A code of ethics creates reliability in people, 
        trust in people, people agree on a common standard. From a purely practical 
        point of view, today, trust in the software profession, trust in things 
        like the criticality of software systems is important&#8212;I mean, do 
        want to fly on a plane that has software patched together? How are we 
        going to assure good software that unless we as a profession at least 
        adhere to certain standards and document our adherence to those standards? 
        So, as a professional issue, that (the code) is a huge, huge thing. That&#8217;s 
        what comes to mind. It bothers me that there is so much contention within 
        the profession about setting minimum standards of admission and performance, 
        because it just seems to me like, &#8220;My gosh?&#8221; You go down to 
        the barbershop, and there&#8217;s a licensed from the county, saying that 
        you&#8217;re not going to get any diseases from them. And yet, people 
        build software for airplanes, nuclear power plants without any such certification. 
        They don&#8217;t even promise you won&#8217;t get a disease. If we don&#8217;t 
        do things to get the publics&#8217; trust, we don&#8217;t deserve it. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>TJ: </strong>No. </p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>No. Not really. It&#8217;s an okay code. In all fairness, 
        all of these things are committee<br>
        activities. I suppose there are lots of people who would have strong opinions 
        about how it should have been done. Recognizing what Don had to go through, 
        the fact that he got the darn thing done in the first place is a miracle. 
        He really made a difference. While the document isn&#8217;t perfect, it 
        does the job it is supposed to do. Don earned all of the awards that he 
        could get, for putting the darn thing together. </p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.<br>
        </strong><br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>Don Gotterbarn, Simon Rogerson, and Keith Miller&#8212;that&#8217;s 
        on the ACM side. On the<br>
        IEEE side, I don&#8217;t have a clue. Maybe Diane Johnson [right?], Edward 
        Martin. Like most efforts of this kind, I wouldn&#8217;t expect 20 or 
        30 people to have played large parts. I&#8217;d expect a small core group 
        to get things done. And I believe that&#8217;s what we had here. </p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>See 17.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>I don&#8217;t know enough about the various hurdles 
        that Don had to go through to be able to answer that question. From what 
        I saw, I wouldn&#8217;t have done anything differently, as far as reviewing 
        the code. </p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said? </strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TJ: </strong>Yes: What organizational hurdles did this effort 
        have to go through to be heard by both ACM and IEEE? These are two huge 
        bureaucracies? I know when you talk to Don, he&#8217;s going to exhibit 
        a lot of resentment. I guess that he&#8217;s not real happy with the ACM 
        bureaucracy. Things like pulling back from the professional licensing 
        issue. This really fights the effectiveness that others&#8212;Don, Dianne, 
        myself&#8212;are trying to do to raise these issues. There was a lot of 
        bureaucratic resistance by ACM and, I suspect, IEEE. I think that&#8217;s 
        a large part of your story. The idea of how many people modified paragraph 
        number 7, for example, is not the real issue. The real issue is: How in 
        the world did this thing get approved in the first place? While you seem 
        to be focusing on the mechanics of committees, I think the real story 
        lies in how you get the thing (the code) sold. And, I think without that 
        part of the story, I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re going to understand. 
        It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that without one committed person 
        like Don, you wouldn&#8217;t be talking to me right now. </p>
