      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background </strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>(Harvard, 1957), M.A. (UCLA, 1961), and Ph.D. (UCLA, 
        1964) all in math.</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>I am TRW Professor of Software Engineering in USC&#8217;s 
        Department of Computer Science. I am also director of the Center for Software 
        Engineering. The Center does research and experimental applications of 
        various aspects of software engineering. Primarily, we try to develop 
        models that help clarify various views of the software engineering enterprise 
        that you&#8217;re undertaking. So, some of the models are success models 
        like Staples or Win-Win [?]. Some of them are product models like requirements 
        on architecture. Some of them are process models like waterfalls and spirals. 
        And some of them are property models for reliability and stuff like that. 
        Every year we do 10 to 20 applications on campus. These are done by students. 
        At the top end, we do projects for the government. We try to develop principles 
        and practices in a way that meet the requirements of the big applications. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong><br>
        <strong>B.A: </strong>Various roles since my first job. I was a math major 
        and took a job at General Dynamics. That happened while I was an undergraduate. 
        That was the career-determining thing. After graduation, I worked there 
        as a Programmer-Analyst 1955-1959. I then went to the Rand Corporation 
        (1959-1973), ending as Head of the Information Sciences Department, and 
        after that to TRW (1973-1989), ending as Chief Scientist in the Defense 
        Systems Group. The last jobs I held before coming to USC were as Director 
        of the DARPA Information Science and Technology Office, and Director of 
        the DDR and E Software and Computer Technology Office. These jobs have 
        given me wide experience in software development.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>I&#8217;m not a registered professional engineer. 
        But I&#8217;m a fellow of 3 engineering societies (e.g., IEEE, etc.). 
        They think I&#8217;m an engineer. I feel I am. I teach, research, and 
        practice software engineering. The only uncertainty I have is the general 
        uncertainty that various profession societies have about software engineering. 
        The fact that I&#8217;ve never formalized anything in an engineering degree.&#8212;But, 
        yes, I would call myself an engineer. </p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>There was an IEEE/ACM predecessor committee to 
        the joint task force that tried to explore what could be done about software 
        engineering to make it a profession. It had an ambitious agenda, because 
        it wanted to do ethics, a body of knowledge, and a curriculum. I was part 
        of that &#8220;blue ribbon&#8221; committee. Basically, what the Blue 
        Ribbon Committee tried to do was to determine priorities, the places that 
        needed the most attention before they went forward. What we found was 
        that the ethics area was moving forward fairly well. Don Gotterbarn was 
        in charge of that and was doing a good job. We didn&#8217;t have to spend 
        a lot of time on that. The body of knowledge was an incredibly difficult 
        thing to do. It required more effort than volunteers normally can give. 
        At that point, the Blue Ribbon Committee handed the baton back to IEEE. 
        Then the society went off to try to figure out what it was going to do 
        from there. </p>
      <p><strong>6. What led you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>I was sitting on a supervisory committee (not SEEPP 
        itself), and that was my job. My participation on the steering committee 
        came through my professional ties and interests. </p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>Just a little bit. When I was working at TRW&#8212;in 
        sales. I was there when they adopted the first version of their code of 
        ethics. Also, I used the ACM code in class. I&#8217;ve tried to build 
        a bridge between value control and ethics, so that software development 
        (and the products that are created) is a win-win situation for everyone 
        involved. I&#8217;ve tried to integrate the ethics into the teaching of 
        software design. </p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong> 
        <br>
        <strong>B.A: </strong>See 6.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>Face-to-face meetings at conferences&#8212;that 
        was about it. The last meeting that I can recall was last year. Don gave 
        a technical paper presentation, and later we had a fairly extensive conversation 
        about it (&#8220;out in the hall&#8221;). We talked about getting together 
        and collaborating, but our busy schedules kept that from happening. </p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>I can&#8217;t really comment on that. I can&#8217;t 
        give you any artifacts that were the results of the face-to-face meetings. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>No, not really. Again, the ethics area was relatively 
        non-controversial compared to all of these other more controversial things 
        that were going on. I focused on the body of knowledge.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>B.A: </strong>I think those have all disappeared. </p>
      <p><strong><br>
        13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result of your 
        participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>As far as the codes of ethics themselves, not all 
        that much. I think the thing that still bothers me is the way they are 
        sort of decoupled from things like the body of knowledge. Basically, the 
        body has appendages (of which ethics seems to be one)&#8212;they don&#8217;t 
        factor into the determining requirements&#8230;determining the right requirements 
        and things like that. The body of knowledge should be constructed with 
        the ethics included at every step in the process. That fits in with the 
        way I teach ethics. Our current research is called value-based software 
        engineering. Almost everything that&#8217;s done in software engineering 
        is &#8220;value neutral&#8221;. In a way, most of the really important 
        human and ethical factors are ignored. So, what I&#8217;m trying to come 
        up with is a reorientation in requirements engineering which is value-based 
        requirements engineering&#8212;value-based architecting, value-based project 
        monitoring and control. Some of this involves generating business cases 
        and determining which requirements are high priority. </p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>B.A: </strong>The important thing about it is that it be integrated 
        into the engineering process. </p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>B.A: </strong>Well, I think the thing that I&#8217;m most unhappy 
        with is that I wasn&#8217;t able to give the project the attention it 
        deserved. There aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day. </p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>B.A: </strong>I&#8217;m quite happy with the code itself. The 
        fact that it is there is really the thing. </p>
      <p><strong><br>
        17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems to you especially 
        important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>B.A: </strong>Yes, Don Gotterbarn. He&#8217;s been pretty busy, 
        but he&#8217;s prioritized himself so the SEEPP was at the top of his 
        list. He&#8217;s done a really good job of keeping it going and well thought 
        through and pushing it through the professional societies. </p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>B.A: </strong>Gotterbarn, Bill Wolf. </p>
      <p><strong><br>
        19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, would 
        you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>I think the main thing&#8212;well, if I had been 
        in charge of the whole professionalization thing&#8212;, I would have 
        pushed to get a more integrated approach to bodies of knowledge and ethics 
        and professional practices and things like that. So, that&#8217;s the 
        main thing. Again, I think we would be getting a lot more value out of 
        the work that&#8217;s gone into the code of ethics if there was a clearer 
        set of guidelines as to where it fits into your daily practice, your project&#8217;s 
        lifecycle, and the decisions you make during the project. </p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>B.A: </strong>No, you&#8217;ve been pretty thorough about this. 
        But, if I&#8217;m cleaning out files and come across something, I&#8217;ll 
        let you know. </p>
