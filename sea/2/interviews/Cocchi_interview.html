<p><strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> B. EE. (Pratt Institute), 1964: M. EE (Pratt Institute), 
        1967; and M. CS. (New York Polytechnic), 1987.</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> I work at IBM in a research center. My research 
        concerns Java virtual machine systems.</p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TC:</strong> For 35 years, I have worked mostly on development 
        of software (doing some management and teaching along the way). The software 
        was for use in a research environment. I did everything from start to 
        finish, from conception to application. Developing software is a subset 
        of what I do. I started out working with hardware (as an EE), but I found 
        software much more interesting. I didn&#8217;t like having to worry about 
        physical stuff like the speed of light.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> Yes&#8212;unless you use my distinction between 
        engineer and scientist. An engineer delivers things on time, on budget, 
        and on function. Scientists do experimental work. I do experimental work.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> I heard about SEEPP from Pat Douglas. She asked 
        me to help with the technical side of something she was working on, maybe 
        in 1992. She&#8217;s an educational psychologist (though she works for 
        IBM). Pat and I met with Mario Barbacci. The focus of our discussion was 
        the Body of Knowledge. Pat had a plan for structuring the body of knowledge 
        in a hierarchy: new hire, experienced, expert, manager, and so on. Though 
        the Body of Knowledge was only one of the three parts of SEEPP&#8217;s 
        effort (the other two being education and ethics, I think), I don&#8217;t 
        recall any mention of ethics at that meeting. I had the impression that 
        SEEPP had been started, but that not much was going on.</p>
      <p><strong>6. What led you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> I didn&#8217;t. I was involved with documenting 
        the Body of Knowledge. Pat and I co-chaired a sub-group for the Body of 
        Knowledge. I had no part in SEEPP&#8217;s steering committee or in any 
        activity having to do with the code of ethics.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> No.</p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>TC:</strong> None. See 5 above.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> We did interviews for the body of knowledge: face-to-face. 
        Email didn&#8217;t work well for that. We had so much to explain before 
        we could get useful answers.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> My experience is that face-to-face is much better 
        than email, phone, or anything else. No question about it. </p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> Not events, but two insights. First, the body of 
        knowledge changes constantly. We could not just state it and be done. 
        We had to build a process that would iterate indefinitely to keep the 
        body of knowledge up to date. Second, the job of constructing the body 
        of knowledge (and of keeping it up to date) was too big to be done entirely 
        by volunteers working on it in their spare time. There is a need for an 
        organization with employees devoted to it full time.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>TC:</strong> No. </p>
      <p><strong> 13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> Nothing relevant to code of ethics</p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>TC:</strong> No opinion.</p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>TC:</strong> No.</p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>TC:</strong> I have never looked at the code.</p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>TC:</strong> For body of knowledge: Pat Douglas had the discipline 
        and model to give the project a form we could work with.</p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> No idea.</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> No idea.</p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said?</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>TC:</strong> No.</p>
