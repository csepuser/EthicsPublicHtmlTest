      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong> Ph.D. in Moral Philosophy, University of Wales, 
        College of Cardiff (1996). My dissertation was on the relation of Green 
        Moral and Political Theory to Liberal Moral and Political Theory. I also 
        have an MA from the University of York (1990) in political theory. My 
        master&#8217;s thesis was on the idea of toleration. My BA in Politics 
        (1989) was from the University of New Castle-Upon-Tyne. I started out 
        as BSc [bachelor of science] in computing, but switched after one year.</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong> I work at the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility 
        (CCSR). It&#8217;s part of the School of Computing here. The centre does 
        research and education in the ethical and social issues related to information 
        and communication technologies. I do applied philosophy. The Centre hired 
        me because they thought explaining what &#8220;social responsibility&#8221; 
        meant was in part a philosophical problem. I also teach, within the School 
        of Computing. [What do you teach?]</p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong>The only experience I have with software development 
        was doing student projects as an undergraduate.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong>No. I was not trained as an engineer, nor am I qualified 
        by experience&#8212;although, over the years, I&#8217;ve gained some experience 
        that would be relevant. </p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong>When Don [Gotterbarn] visited here, January 1997. 
        Don told me what he was doing. He gave me a draft of the code and asked 
        for comment. I gave feedback. </p>
      <p><strong>6. What led you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong>I like to be cooperative. I was then relatively new 
        in post. So, it was something to get my teeth in. I had an interest in 
        codes of ethics from my Ph.D. I had a chapter on the role of business, 
        including its limited liability. [Is this right?]</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong> I&#8217;ve certainly become much more familiar since 
        then. But I was already familiar with some codes in 1997, some codes of 
        business ethics, but not codes of professional ethics. I was then aware 
        that professional codes existed but I had not looked at any. </p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>BF:</strong>I think I got my ordering of events wrong [in 5 above]. 
        Within a few weeks after I took up my post here, there was a conference, 
        ETHICOMP &#8217;96&#8212;one of a series of annual conferences dealing 
        with ethics in computing. (The first one, held the year before, was at 
        De Montfort. Since then, there was one in the Netherlands, one in Poland, 
        and so on. Each conference is held in a different place.) The &#8216;96 
        one was in Madrid. Prof. Barroso gave a paper, &#8220;The PAPA of Computer 
        Ethics&#8221;, in Spanish. &#8220;PAPA&#8221; stands for &#8220;Privacy, 
        Accuracy, Property, and Accessibility.&#8221; When Don arrived in January 
        1997, I was working on a response to Barroso&#8217;s paper (&#8220;Why 
        an Incomplete Code is Worse than None at All&#8221;). I had been looking 
        at the codes linked to CCSP&#8217;s website. So, I was ready to look at 
        another code&#8212;and I had some strong ideas about what a code should 
        look like.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong> I generally worked with paper drafts of the code. 
        There were frequent face-to-face meetings with Don and Simon [Rogerson]. 
        There were also emails between Don and me. I also received emails sent 
        to the SEEPP listserve. </p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong> I think the face-to-face meetings were useful, but 
        only in conjunction with drafts passed to me on paper or electronically. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong> Two. One occasion that sticks in my mind is calling 
        on Don in an office here, talking about phrases I&#8217;d proposed and 
        Don wasn&#8217;t happy with. [DEEP ARCHIVE THE FOLLOWING:] The other occasion 
        I&#8217;m a bit wary of talking about here: I tried to have my name withdrawn 
        from the list of signers. I felt the short version undermined the completeness 
        of the code. It could be used without the long version, thus undermining 
        the completeness of the code I thought necessary to avoid misinterpretation 
        and abuse. Don agreed to take my name off, but it ended up there anyway.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>BF:</strong> Yes. I will try to find and send. Please send me 
        reminders.</p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong> Yes. I think I became much more aware of the value 
        of the short version. What we need is a hypertext version. It would begin 
        with the short code with visual cues to look further. Touch a key word 
        and you would be taken to the relevant provisions in the long version. 
        Touch one of the provisions in the long version and you would be taken 
        to some cases or articles interpreting that provision. A code is better 
        than no attention to ethics. But there are other approaches that would 
        be better than a code, for example, incorporating ethics into courses. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>BF:</strong> What is important is for there to be an honest 
        attempt to uphold the code, understand it, and see it as a way into morality&#8212;rather 
        than as a statement of morality.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong>I&#8217;m unhappy that I failed to prevent the short 
        version from having the free-standing role it eventually got. What I was 
        pleased with was that I always felt my opinions were being taken seriously. 
        There was always a reasonable chance that what I suggested would be taken 
        on board&#8212;if it seemed an improvement.</p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong> I&#8217;m pleased with how well the full code deals 
        with incompleteness. The Preamble provides the right sort of guide to 
        how to use the code. What I&#8217;m not pleased about is the short version. 
        I also didn&#8217;t much like the publicity materials. There are no visual 
        cues to let someone who sees the code know of the depth behind it, both 
        reference works and education. We need to think about ways to help people 
        see the code in context.</p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>BF:</strong>Yes, Don Gotterbarn. </p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong> Gotterbarn. No other opinion. I&#8217;m not aware 
        of the involvement of anyone else&#8212;except for the people here, of 
        course.</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have pursued a code 
        at all. I &#8216;d have pursued education or ethical questions. </p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said?</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>BF:</strong>No. </p>
