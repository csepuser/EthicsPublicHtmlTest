      <p> <strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong> 
      <p><strong>DP: </strong>B.A. in Public and International Affairs from Princeton 
        University (1977). J.D. from New York University Law School (1980).</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP:</strong>Covington &amp; Burling is a major international 
        law firm. I do a range of legal work. In the past, I have done some litigation, 
        but now my work is primarily transactional. Most of my current work is 
        in intellectual property (IP) issues related to software, data, and new 
        media. I am of counsel.</p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>DP: </strong>I&#8217;m not a software developer, though I have 
        been interested in computing since I was an undergraduate. My experience 
        with software development is primarily either as a user of software or 
        as a legal adviser to people involved in software development. In addition, 
        I have received a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent Office indicating 
        that I will be issued a patent on a software process I invented. I advise 
        clients concerning software, data, and new media licensing transactions. 
        I got into this area by serving as President of the Business Software 
        Alliance, an organization formed by Microsoft and other software companies 
        to protect intellectual property rights, and then by handling software-related 
        litigation and being asked by existing clients to advise on new transactions.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP: </strong>No.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>DP:</strong>From Greg Swift. He is now Deputy Chief Information 
        Officer for the National Gallery of Art, but back then he was working 
        for Mitretek.</p>
      <p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP:</strong>Actually, I didn&#8217;t participate in SEEPP&#8217;s 
        work. About the time the various versions began to appear, 1996, I became 
        quite busy in my law practice and continued to be busy until some time 
        in 2000. I was never individually approached to do anything and kind of 
        lost track of the project.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP:</strong>Yes. I certainly was familiar with the lawyer&#8217;s 
        code of ethics&#8212;the Rules of Professional Conduct (including the 
        District of Columbia Rules and the ABA Model Rules). I also now have some 
        familiarity with the AMA&#8217;s code of ethics because of work I have 
        done on a matter involving a physician&#8217;s professional conduct.</p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP: </strong>I don&#8217;t think I did&#8212;apart, perhaps, 
        from reading some emails.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP:</strong> Emails, I think. No phone or face-to-face meetings 
        (except with Greg Swift). No letters.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP:</strong>I might have participated more if someone had asked 
        me personally, even if only by phone or email. The general emails didn&#8217;t 
        make me feel involved. I wasn&#8217;t sure what role to play. The emails 
        seemed aimed at engineers. What role should a lawyer play in the process? 
        I wasn&#8217;t asked about my background, as far as I recall, and because 
        of my own workload, I did not reach out to suggest any particular role. 
        That&#8217;s certainly my responsibility as much as anyone&#8217;s, but 
        had they or I taken the initiative to carve out a role for me, I&#8217;m 
        sure I would have been more likely to participate.</p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP: </strong>No.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP:</strong>I haven&#8217;t found any so far. But I have some 
        old archive disks at home. I&#8217;ll check to see whether there might 
        be something on them. I&#8217;m curious to see what, if anything, I can 
        find.[He found nothing.]</p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP </strong>No change I&#8217;m aware of.</p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP: </strong>My experience with codes of ethics is primarily 
        with the lawyer&#8217;s Rules of Professional Conduct. But I think much 
        the same is true of other codes. The Rules help to keep lawyers mindful 
        of their responsibility to the people they serve. In other words, the 
        Rules cause (most) lawyers to reflect, at the time they act, on the ethical 
        implications of what they do, especially in novel situations that raise 
        ethical challenges. Of course, the existence of sanctions for violation, 
        both in the form of disciplinary consequences and in the form of potential 
        civil liability, is an important factor in focusing lawyers&#8217; attention 
        on such standards. In most, if not all, professions, ethical standards 
        that are merely precatory are likely to be ignored.</p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP: </strong>As I have already said, I wish I had participated 
        more.</p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DP:</strong> No.</p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DB: </strong>Don Gotterbarn. He sent most of the email I remember.</p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DB:</strong> No one, except Don Gotterbarn and Greg Swift.</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>DB:</strong> As I suggested earlier, I would have responded to 
        anyone who sent in his or her name with a personal phone call or at least 
        a personal email asking about special skills or interests. Once I knew 
        something about the person, I would invite contributions related to the 
        special skills or interests. For me at least, group email works well only 
        between people who know each other some other way. Of course, face-to-face 
        meetings would have been good too, but I might not have been able to attend 
        if, for example, they had been held at a remote location.</p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>DB:</strong>No.</p>
