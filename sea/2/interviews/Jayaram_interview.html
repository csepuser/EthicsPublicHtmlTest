      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background? </strong> 
      <p>BS in EE, MS in EE and PhD in CS<br>
	  Experience in academia and industry for over 35 years.<br>
	  Held two patents in microprocessor hardware.</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ</strong>: I now teach computer science at London Metropolitan 
        University. I also am active in research and consulting.</p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ: </strong>As electronic engineering went from circuit boards 
        to software, I did the same. By 1975, I was concentrating on software. 
        [See 1 above.] From 1977-80, I did research, in Mysore, on parallel processing. 
        I also was a consultant to small and medium enterprises, especially concerning 
        software for control systems. By 1980, I was Senior Software Engineer 
        at KTM Electronics. 1982-86, I worked on software for condition monitoring 
        for BP [British Petroleum].</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m not particular about 
        title. The title &#8220;software engineer&#8221; is okay with me. That&#8217;s 
        where my contributions are. What is the difference between information 
        systems and software engineering? In the UK, we seem to call people who 
        work on information systems &#8220;systems analysts&#8221; rather than 
        &#8220;software engineers&#8221;.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I was then chair of the IEEE-CS UK-Ireland Chapter&#8212;and 
        a member of ACM since 1987. Mario Baracci emailed me about SEEPP. We were 
        acquainted, but I think he emailed me about it because he wanted to contact 
        the chapter. That would have been sometime in 1993, or early 1994, I think.</p>
      <p><strong>6. What led you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> Good question. Two things. First is my own personal 
        life. My son had a rare medical disease. In the course of dealing with 
        his doctors, I had become aware of medical ethics. Second, I had long 
        been troubled by the unrealistic timetables and resources set for software 
        projects on which I worked and was brought in to consult about. The problem 
        seemed more than technical. The invitation from SEEPP was an invitation 
        to think in a systematic way about issues already on my mind, how something 
        like medical ethics might be developed for software engineering.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> No. Well, to some extent I was. I had to be familiar 
        with the medical code [see 6 above]. Also, I am a high-caste Brahmin, 
        the son of a professor who was very ethical. For Brahmins, the public 
        good is what one should aim at. We are teachers. Our job is to spread 
        knowledge, not to get rich. We have our own code.</p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>NJ:</strong> I collected British codes and did a comparison.
        That  would have been at the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994. We
        wanted to see what the state of the art was. </p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> Overwhelmingly by email. </p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> Email is for preparation (setting the scene), but 
        you need face-to-face meetings to develop the final project. The fundamentals 
        should be done by email, but the finer points require face-to-face meetings. 
        I&#8217;d have preferred two face-to-face meetings, one in Europe and 
        one in US.</p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I will have to look at my diary first. I kept those 
        from the period. Right now all that sticks in my memory is a debate over 
        the term &#8220;economic disadvantage&#8221;.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I may have something on paper. I will look. I&#8217;m 
        sure I don&#8217;t have anything on my disk drives. Every time I change 
        institutions, I have to wipe my disk drives clean. It&#8217;s to protect 
        intellectual property.</p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> Certainly. I think of codes as life process. I agree 
        that getting the language right is important. But I now think it&#8217;s 
        more important what you do with the code once you have it. What influence 
        can it have? Software engineering has also changed a lot in just the few 
        years since the code was adopted. I now think we didn&#8217;t emphasize 
        maintenance enough.</p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>NJ:</strong> It&#8217;s having some kind of soul for the profession. 
        A profession is not alive without ethics. The code is part of giving a 
        profession a soul.</p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I was pleased to be able to interact with people 
        working on such a project and to be able to make some contribution. Participating 
        was a very rich experience.</p>
      <p><strong><br>
        16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially pleased 
        with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m unhappy with anything. 
        We were busy, too busy to do more. What was lacking was more encouragement 
        from the organization. We should have had a chance to meet the people 
        we were working with. The societies should have found the money for one 
        or two face-to-face meetings. </p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>NJ:</strong> Ed Mechler. He saved the project when it seemed 
        to have fallen apart. He kept us going until we drafted the code (version 
        1). Everything after that was minor in comparison. </p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>NJ:</strong> Ed Mechler</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I would have had one or two face-to-face meetings, 
        with budget from IEEE/ACM: One meeting relatively early in the process 
        and conference or workshop when the code was wrapping up. The conference 
        or workshop would have been open to all, with participants in drafting 
        the code making some of the presentations. The purpose would have been 
        to help disseminate the code. </p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>NJ:</strong> No. </p>
