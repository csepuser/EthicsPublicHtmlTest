      <p><strong><a name="Preliminary"></a>Preliminary Comments:</strong><br>
        * Commitment overcame management problems<br>
        DG: Looking back over the development of the Software Engineering Code
        of Ethics and Professional practice you are amazed by the number of disasters,
        pitfalls, traps that none of us anticipated. And what happened was it
        looks like a project that was done from the top down. At an International
        Software Engineering Conference in Baltimore there were several groups
        holding concurrent meetings. All were considering a suggestion emailed
        by Fletcher Buckley recommending [a code of ethics]. The IEEE Board of
        governors appointed a Blue Ribbon Committee to investigate the recommendation
        and the issue of professionalizing software engineering. There are common
        characteristics of a Blue Ribbon committee; all of its members are recognized
        in the sectors, are incredibly busy, but may not know one another and
        have very different views about the nature of software engineering and
        what is best for it What ultimately happened was that the abstract direction
        from the top layers of Blue Ribbon Committees and Professional Organizations
        came down through multiple layers to a group of volunteers with equally
        diverse and with wildly strange backgrounds and commitments that managed
        to produce the final accepted version. It still amazes me how this very
        significant, effective document that&#8217;s had an impact on software
        engineering already survived the process of its generation. </p>
      <p>The point is that everybody was making mistakes all over the place and
        a certain stick-to-itive-ness of you&#8217;re committed to this and you&#8217;re
        going to bounce against this hurdle and keep going and keep trying, brought
        it through. And it&#8217;s amazing because the number of people and the
        pieces they played is just exciting when you look at it. And you can&#8217;t
        give credit to all of the key players, that is one point. This is an
        event that happened in spite of; let me say in the strongest sense, in
        spite of a whole lot of stupid mistakes and contentious things going
        on at within and between the various layers of managing this project.
        It still came out as a successful project. The commitment of those involved
        overcame these problems. So, that&#8217;s interesting and exciting. That&#8217;s
        one.</p>
      <p>Is that you just turning it off and saving the tape? </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: No, the tape&#8217;s running. Maybe we could say this was Don Gotterbarn&#8217;s
        spirited preamble. We&#8217;re doing a series of oral histories from
        now till doomsday. It&#8217;s, let&#8217;s see, if I get the date correct
        here, September 22, 2005. We&#8217;re on the IIT&#8217;s campus. My name
        is Tom Misa. Don has some preliminary comments and I&#8217;ll shift to
        a set of questions but go ahead.</p>
      <p>* Overconfidence in technology led to misunderstandings about the progress
        of the project <br>
        <strong>DG</strong>: Well there is a second comment, sometimes people put mistaken faith
        in technology and it&#8217;s interesting that technologists do this.
        So, given a horrendous state of email at this time (1993-1999) emails
        were lost or corrupted, work had to be redone, some people came in and
        out of the project because of lost contact or changing email addresses.
        This project spans the development of the internet. And all sorts of
        strange things happened, one because of the inadequacy of some email
        equipment, two because of the incomplete understanding of the way email
        worked by some of the technical practitioners who participated in this.
        This generated all sorts of misunderstandings about human contributions. </p>
      <p>What&#8217;s really interesting to me about this is that the faith was
        that the technology is okay, and it was the human beings who were evil,
        rather than looking specifically for the technological issues. That kind
        of confusion permeates the current text written by Michael Davis written
        about this. That&#8217;s point two.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>TM</strong>: Point two, okay.</p>
      <p>* Mistaken belief that public documents accurately reflect the underlying
        character of a project.<br>
        <strong>DG</strong>: Point three, when writing history, basing that history on the existence
        of public documents that are shared in a very public way, basing all
        inferences on that is in fact a considerable mistake.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong><a name="nature"></a>Questions about the Nature of Software Engineering and Professions</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So now I&#8217;d like to ask you a couple, a set of questions really,
        that deal with the field of software engineering and also the notion
        of a profession.</p>
      <p>1. Software engineering as a term seems everybody points to this NATO
        conference in 1968 as an origin point. Could you give me suggestions
        of other names that would occur at the time to describe activities that
        became known as software engineering? </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Computer programming or other names that could serve as alternatives
        to software engineering. In &#8216;68 you&#8217;re still relatively early
        in the history of computers and the history of computer systems. Computer
        systems at that point primarily were accounting systems, bank tracking
        systems, government types of systems; systems which fired missiles, large
        companies are getting interested in it. At that stage of the growth of
        computing you really have no discipline. People were figuring out what
        they were doing and not recording it. The kinds of catastrophes or examples
        of flawed software that occurred, led some people to lock onto the word &#8220;software
        engineering&#8221;. The whole point of that was to indicate that you
        needed a disciplined approach to the way in which you developed software.</p>
      <p>So those people who uttered that at that point did not have in mind
        licensing regulations in the United States; did not have in mind registration.
        All of this has become a distraction because of the use of the word &#8216;engineering&#8221;.
        In fact, in most other countries the word &#8220;engineering&#8221; does
        not carry the honorific tone that it does in the US. Using this word
        when you bring it into the US causes all sorts of difficulty, because
        being an &#8216;engineer&#8217; in the United States is a protected title.
        And I have to be careful here because I don&#8217;t have the exact factual
        data but in general I believe in order to call yourself an engineer you
        have to have an engineering degree and graduate from some college that
        has a certified degree.</p>
      <p> <strong>TM</strong>: It&#8217;s typically an ABET accredited degree and we actually
        have issues because people would like to talk about information architecture
        and information engineering. We can do one but when we say &#8216;engineering&#8217; it
        has a special loaded term. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: In every place else in the world they are now calling these folks
        ICT professionals; information communications technology professionals.
        It&#8217;s not software engineer. The issues of the kinds of craziness
        that came about just because of the choice of the word &#8220;engineer&#8221; in
        software engineering are evident, I believe it is in the state of Indiana
        or Illinois, where in order to do anything for the state government in
        terms of software, you must have graduated with an engineering degree
        from a ABET accredited college. The last time I looked I believe MIT
        is not an ABET accredited college. So you can have a computer science
        graduate from MIT, and someone who had graduated from some small state
        college with an engineering degree having had no computing, and the job
        would not go to the MIT graduate because they were not a quote &#8220;engineer&#8221;.
        So the word &#8220;engineering&#8221; is a problem but its use at the
        NATO Conference was a label that says, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a goal we
        have in mind when we do things.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You mentioned the different failures that were evident in the 1960s
        and the failures would have been, the one that would have been on my
        mind, would have been the software written for the operating system of
        the IBM 360. Was that one of the examples of failure that people have
        in mind?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Well, that&#8217;s one of the types of failures. But interestingly
        enough, the failures at that point were not catastrophic failures but
        financial failures. But I tend to talk a lot about catastrophic failures
        because it gets people&#8217;s attention quickly, and you don&#8217;t
        need a long budgetary explanation. But most of those tended to be software
        delivered late, software which would not do the job, sometimes misunderstandings
        about what was going on. But you now have this label &#8216; software
        engineer&#8217; that probably was a tremendous mistake. To simply talk
        about professional software developer would be better than the label &#8220;software
        engineer&#8221;, because there would be no discussions about engineering
        or whether you&#8217;re doing engineering ethics.</p>
      <p>And that brings me to your second question, which was one about what
        I consider to be a professional. </p>
      <p>
        2. Defining a profession and being a professional<br>
        <strong>TM</strong>: Well, there are two things. How would you define the profession and
        then what does it mean to be a professional?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Okay, they&#8217;re different questions.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Two different questions, correct.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And in fact the question &#8220;How do you define a profession?&#8221; can
        be answered two ways. One is fairly simple. Is it recognized by law as
        a profession? So the Taft Hartly Act in the 1970s did not recognize computer
        developers as professionals. And some very strange legal decisions are
        based on that, for example people who we would now call crooks and villains
        were exonerated because developing computer software was not legally
        considered a profession. The other approach is the philosopher way of
        defining &#8216;profession&#8217; by setting down a set of criteria as
        to what constitutes a profession. These criteria vary from philosopher
        to philosopher. They generally include things like there&#8217;s a specialized
        body of knowledge. Now it isn&#8217;t simply a specialized body of knowledge
        because plumbing is a specialized body of knowledge, carpentry is a specialized
        body of knowledge, but it&#8217;s a body of knowledge that requires a
        higher degree of education. So that&#8217;s the body of knowledge part. </p>
      <p>Another part is that they will apply the skill in the service of society.
        So lawyers and doctors are considered professionals because what lawyers
        do presumably helps society to function more smoothly, what doctors do
        is to care for the health of society. People talk about journalism ethics
        and professional journalists in the same regard. And I am going to resist
        making any side remarks about this.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>TM</strong>: Don&#8217;t worry. No Enron jokes... But it&#8217;s important to
          say that those are goals and ideals, not everybody lives up to those. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And they&#8217;re targets, you set. Now incorporated in this is
        one of the things that causes some difficulty. Professions &#8220;have
        a professional organization representing them.&#8221; So in the US we
        point to the American Bar Association or the American Medical Association,
        and then they have a set of standards by which the people in this profession
        apply, aspire to, and try to follow. And your adherence to these standards
        is part of your right to call yourself a member of that profession. Now
        there are a number of problems. When we talk about software engineering
        being a profession and trying to professionalize it, one of the early
        concerns about this was the claim, &#8220;Well there is no standard body
        of knowledge. Software engineers do too many different kinds of things.&#8221; And
        the people who say that talk from software engineering as if this made
        it different from other disciplines. But when we look at medicine as
        a profession it includes the dermatologists, the oncologists, the optometrists,
        the ophthalmologists, the endocrinologists, the...and I&#8217;m running
        out of labels for now. But each of those...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: All doctors for all different body parts. </p>
      <p><strong>DM</strong>: All doctors for all different body parts and then there the holistic
        ones who do the whole body. And so that business about there&#8217;s
        a wide diversity of software development does not make software development
        different from other professions. And then there is an argument, some
        of the philosophers argue in their books that, &#8220;Well there is no
        single representative organization for software engineers or computer
        folks.&#8221; And the presumption is there is a single organization for
        medical doctors, but that&#8217;s incorrect because I can go to Tonga
        and practice medicine. I can join the Tongan&#8217;s Medical Association
        which has a different set of standards then the American Medical Association.
        I think that the important thing is not the appeal to the organization
        but the common beliefs and commitments to a way in which medicine is
        practiced. Don&#8217;t cause harm to your patient. Apply the best techniques
        you can for the health of your patient. Those kinds of principles can
        be generalized to most things that intend to be professions. What we
        talk about when we talk about a profession as far as I understand it,
        must include something called &#8216;a higher order of care&#8217;. That
        is because of the power and impact that you have, you have more responsibility
        to the people, to your patients, to your customers, clients, whatever
        they&#8217;re called in your profession.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Could you give a description or a definition of software engineering?
        I&#8217;m trying to recognize that it has many different overlaps but
        what would be the core problem, or core method, or core insight that
        someone who&#8217;s doing software engineering would have that someone
        who&#8217;s doing computer programming or system&#8217;s analysis might
        not have?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>DG</strong>: I think software engineering has to include both the general and
          the particular; an understanding of the way systems operate and what
          you&#8217;re doing in the system and how what you&#8217;re doing will
          impact the application of that system and the development of that system
          and the way that is used in society. So a programmer who&#8217;s writing
          a piece of material can understand the system view. I view software
          engineers as people who take a systems view to their development, even
          though because they are developing a small piece of software, you might
          call that person a programmer. Let me distinguish programmers and coders,
          or people that I might be willing to call software engineers who primarily
          write code. In some industries you are told this is what you will do,
          this is what you will code, this is the way you will code it, and this
          is what our standards are. We can actually write computer programs
          that comply with this. People who merely do this I think of as &#8216;coders&#8217;.
          They&#8217;re not software engineers. They don&#8217;t respond to,
          or realize the moral responsibility, or the way in which their systems
          relate to other systems. They don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going
        on and use that to control the way in which they do things. </p>
      <p>Here&#8217;s
          a very technical example. One of the ways in which you can write a
          piece of code to repeats things is to write a statement that
        says, &#8220;Do this while such and such is true.&#8221; Another way
        you can do it is to say, &#8220;Do this until such and such comes about.&#8221; Most
        programmers, most coders treat those as identical. Someone who has a
        software engineering approach would understand and take into account
        that, if they use this and they&#8217;re writing a program that dispensed
        a very powerful medicine into a patient automatically, if they use the &#8220;do
        while something is true&#8221; they will prevent overdosing the patient.
        If they use the loop that says, &#8220;do this until something is true,&#8221; they
        will have already overdosed the patient and then found out they&#8217;ve
        made a mistake. Having a systems view and approach to this is what I
        consider to be part of software engineering or a major part of it; to
        understand these issues. It&#8217;s not just technical skill. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: The potential moral consequences, that is the consequences for the
        safety, health, welfare of society, anybody who&#8217;s using the program
        or if it&#8217;s software that&#8217;s overseeing missiles, or nuclear
        weapons, or nuclear power plants, or chemical plants that&#8217;s everybody
        in society.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>DG</strong>: What I&#8217;ve done&#8230; The answer is, &#8220;Yes, but.&#8221; What
        I&#8217;ve done is that I&#8217;ve fallen into the trap of using my short
        hand examples which are always life threatening ones. In the same regard,
        writing a program for a hospital billing system where you don&#8217;t
        understand what you&#8217;ve done and the hospital goes out of business
        because your program malfunctioned or because you didn&#8217;t write
        the program right, or writing a system that means that people won&#8217;t
        buy a product from a certain company just because it&#8217;s hard to
        use and you didn&#8217;t develop the user interface properly are examples
        of it as well. Writing a web interface and using Times Roman font and
        pure black letters on a bright white background is also a mistake that
        the systems developer, software engineer should know about, because that
        kind of interface will give a dyslexic a headache trying to translate
        it because of the serifs of the font against the bright white background.
        And it actually is painful. You&#8217;ve created a website that causes
        pain. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Which on the doctors&#8217; Hippocratic Oath that&#8217;s one thing
        you&#8217;re not supposed to do, cause harm unneeded. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And I have to be&#8230; I&#8217;m using the word harm I don&#8217;t
        just mean physical harm but I get people&#8217;s attention when I talk
        about physical harm. It&#8217;s a weakness in my approach though because
        they think I&#8217;m only talking about critical safety stuff. </p>
      <p>And the software engineer, generally, people will talk about the software
        engineer as being involved in large systems. I think large is a relative
        term and you could have a software engineer applying the principles of
        good design and good development even in small systems. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Could you say something more about the notion of the system&#8217;s
        approach in my own field history of technology that a particularly&#8230;that
        we have a specific definition of a systems&#8217; approach? I&#8217;m
        not going to give here because I&#8217;d like to hear yours. Maybe we
        can talk back and forth about it but I&#8217;m interested if they overlap.
        A systems approach as opposed to a different kind of approach?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: The way I&#8217;ve been using it here involves I would think two
        basic elements. One is the systems&#8217; approach involves you thinking
        about the place of what you&#8217;re doing in a system and its relationship
        to the whole system and how that might change it. So even if you&#8217;re
        doing a small part of the system, you can still take a systems&#8217; approach
        to that. The other version of the systems&#8217; approach is you&#8217;re
        developing the whole system and you&#8217;re worried about the impacts
        of the system outside of its what we call side effects, the side effects,
        the direct effects and side effects of the system you&#8217;re developing.
        And how the way you&#8217;re developing it will change those direct effects
        and side effects.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So the direct effects are ones that are intended and the side effects
        may not be intended but are just as real. Unintended consequences, consequences
        real that have to be contended with.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Several examples&#8230; In New Zealand last year there was some
        modification made to a device that&#8217;s used to do cataract surgery.
        And the technician who was modifying the device noticed that the functionality
        of the off button, which is retracting devices from the eye and turning
        off the system and so on, were exactly similar to the functionality of
        the emergency button, retracting the devices and so on. So he simplified
        the code and made it more consistent by removing the emergency button
        from the left hand side of this device and all functionality is in the
        off button. Otherwise the device looked about the same, and of course
        you can anticipate immediately the consequence. There was a situation
        where a doctor in New Zealand was working on someone and the emergency
        came up and the doctor hit the left hand side of the device where the
        emergency button had been located, so it wouldn&#8217;t be hit by accident,
        and didn&#8217;t feel anything. And the doctor reacted urgently and slammed
        the device again with his hand where that button should have been, because
        the device was doing bad things to this person&#8217;s eye, and actually
        moved the device while it was inside the person&#8217;s eye. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And&#8230;failing to take a systems&#8217; view. Seeing the object&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Don&#8217;t use the word &#8220;seeing&#8221; in this example.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Seeing, that&#8217;s right. Perceiving, accurately perceiving, in
        fact, and acting on that. My own field uses systems in the first view;
        thinking about the whole system even if you&#8217;re working on a small
        invention that has consequences for a water, electrical system or production
        system. We typically don&#8217;t take that second view about consciously
        thinking about the impacts. Although, that&#8217;s an important thing
        when you&#8217;re doing technology assessment in a whole system is to
        think broadly about that. And that&#8217;s a nice example.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Let me give you one other example that will show that quite simply.
        Again these are horrifying types of examples. In New Zealand, when I
        was there, someone took one of these devices that you use to remotely
        unlock your car, and had this wonderful idea about programming to, when
        you press the button, start the car remotely. Now in cold climates that&#8217;s
        good because you can get the heater started as you&#8217;re walking up
        to your car and things like that. In dangerous environments that&#8217;s
        good because you can get the car started and run into your car and run
        away if somebody&#8217;s chasing you and you have your car parked in
        an environment that you&#8217;re uncomfortable in. In New Zealand, which
        is a highly volcanically originated country, most of it&#8217;s consists
        of very steep hills and so on. In the city of Auckland, which is built
        on seven volcanoes, there are almost no level streets. This is where
        the program was instituted. Now if you know about driving in New Zealand,
        they use standard shift. When you park a car in a standard shift you
        normally do something, even if you forget to put the brake on, you put
        the car into gear. And the obvious and expected thing happened. Shortly
        after the remote start was introduced a pregnant lady was walking in
        front of a parked car, a gentleman while approaching this car started
        it remotely. The car jumped and crushed the lady between the car in front
        and his car. She went to the hospital and people minimized the results
        saying, &#8220;Oh well, it was just a 10 week premature birth and they&#8217;re
        both okay.&#8221; And according to my limited medical knowledge, a 10
        week premature baby will have trouble for the rest of their life. The
        simple notion was the person who was writing this, it worked; you pushed
        the button, you started the car. You should&#8217;ve taken into account
        that there are standard shift cars, and could have done one simple thing
        and made it so it just doesn&#8217;t work if your car is standard shift,
        or it has a fail on it that if your car is in gear and you have a standard
        shift it works. Ten minutes more work in the design would have changed
        the impact of this whole thing. The programmers did exactly what they
        were told, but they were coders. They didn&#8217;t code well.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: But then you would have the expectation that a software engineer
        would take a broad enough view. That is, not looking at the narrow technical
        functionality of the code but also the broader social - you could have
        cultural and economic - impacts and to take those impacts into account
        while they were doing the design. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: That&#8217;s what we mean&#8230;Yes and that&#8217;s my interpretation
        of a higher order of care. Making software engineering a professional
        computerist, if you want to call them that. It&#8217;s just like people
        who are doctors could technically do something like, if you went into
        the doctor and said, &#8220;Doctor I want you cut off both my arms at
        the elbow tomorrow,&#8221; the doctor could say, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and
        do that quite successfully and effectively, and make money. But you and
        anyone else would deny that that doctor was being a professional because
        they didn&#8217;t take&#8230;there may be some reasons but if the doctor
        didn&#8217;t ask and explore, that doctor&#8217;s not doing their higher
        order of care. That&#8217;s what I mean by a professional software developer.
        And I get caught in all of the rhetoric that goes around the word &#8220;software
        engineer&#8221; and &#8220;software engineering professional&#8221; and
        so on but you have in these words gotten my definition of professional
        and professionalism. And now to be certified as part of your profession
        you need all sorts of other standards and right now software engineering
        doesn&#8217;t have that, in part because of all the competition with
        the engineering profession. The engineering profession wants to impose
        engineering standards on becoming a software engineer and so you must
        do things in some cases, studying, I&#8217;ve forgotten it, the one with
        heat transfer, thermo&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Thermodynamics.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Thermodynamics, you must have a course in thermodynamics. Well,
        most software engineers don&#8217;t need that but to get that label &#8220;engineer&#8221;,
        there are issues about that and that&#8217;s why. The word &#8220;engineering&#8221; in
        software engineering has caused a problem. Calling this code of ethics
        a software engineering code of ethics in one sense causes a problem.
        We built a code of ethics that will fit professional software developers,
        which is what I think most of us who were on that committee had in his
        mind as software engineers. And it&#8217;s only the &#8216;engineering&#8217; word
        you will see when you look at the history of the effort also caused difficulty
        or facilitated certain sorts of criticisms because people could then
        say, &#8220;Well this doesn&#8217;t look like an engineering code.&#8221; Well
        if it did it wouldn&#8217;t look like a software code. So it has some
      engineering elements and some software elements and so on.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You&#8217;ve defined software engineering as having
        a systems approach, a certain kind of attention to the whole system,
        an up front attention
        to the downstream consequences. And I&#8217;m wondering whether there
        are any special methods that were important as software engineering evolved,
        especially in these early years say between the 1968 NATO conference
        and the founding about 20 years later...? There&#8217;s kind of a funny
        lag between the early interest in software engineering and the founding
        in 1985 of the founding of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie
        Mellon, which was an early institutionalization of software engineering
      as an ongoing concern.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Some people think that labels make reality. So if you call a law
        that favors people who do pollution a &#8216;Blue Skies&#8217; law you&#8217;ll
        think that, &#8220;Okay now we&#8217;re paying attention to it.&#8221; The
        software engineering label came out and it was used at the NATO conference.
        The Software Engineering Institute was in response to demands by the
        military for good software. The Software Engineering Institute, when
        I was working in Pennsylvania at the time of its development and it was
        funded by the Air Force primarily. Because they were getting unreliable
        software, software that would fail at certain points, software that would
        not run at certain points, and when you&#8217;re flying an airplane you
        consider it important that the software that controls the airplane continues
        to function properly. </p>
      <p>The funding of the Software Engineering Institute in 1985 did not indicate
        a gap in the concern for the development of good software. We&#8217;ve
        been worrying about it and doing the things like that, working on the
        development of good software. There&#8217;s an inference that people
        stopped caring between &#8217;68 and &#8217;86. That&#8217;s nonsense
        to think that no one is looking at the development of the way in which
        you write software. You have computer science becom[ing] a discipline
        and [it] is taught in universities. You have people writing textbooks
        about the way you ought to do testing and what the limits of testing
        are. You have people designing techniques that say, &#8220;If you&#8217;re
        developing safety critical software, we can apply mathematical criteria
        to it,&#8221; called mutation testing, &#8220;which w[ill] allow me to
        give you a number applied to the degree of reliability,&#8221; and we
        can do these things. One of the problems is, as the education was developing
        you still had a community that came into developing software without
        going through this education. They figured out how to do it on their
        own, and thinking because they could make a program work, that it was
        okay rather than applying quality standards to it. So, in part what the
        Software Engineering Institute intended by its label is to put up front
        again. &#8220;These are standards that we will set up, and we will talk
        about standards, and we will disseminate these standards.&#8221; It was
        not, &#8220;Oh! Golly, we&#8217;re making mistakes. Let&#8217;s pay attention
        to it again after 17 years.&#8221; To characterize that period is wrong.
        I could waste the whole day giving you examples of each new and interesting
        discovery. I mean, we use to have a way of writing code that was called
        spaghetti code. And you just wrote statements until you got the thing
        to work. Then people figured out writing software was a form of problem
        solving and you&#8217;d apply strategies to it. Then we actually organized
        the strategies and developed something called structured programming.
        You have books by Edsger Dijkstra called The Discipline of Programming,
        which appeared well before &#8217;86. Which were hallmarks about&#8230; and
        ways in which you could prove programs mathematically. All of these efforts
        are doing things to improve the process of making software, and applying,
      and developing standards. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So there were ongoing practices within the computer science discipline
      and within people in the field?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And people who knew it.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: But people didn&#8217;t label it necessarily as software engineering. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: No.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So, it didn&#8217;t have a kind of visibility. When we look now,
        back and say, &#8220;Well what is the history of software engineering?&#8221; we
        would miss those important practices. But if we changed our view and
        said, &#8220;What were people doing to improve the quality or reliability
        of software?&#8221; then we would&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Then you&#8217;d trap all that. Yes, that&#8217;s correct. So harping
        on this particular label is a problem.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: It&#8217;s a particularly powerful label. So if you try to get a
        picture of what it does and what it doesn&#8217;t do seems important.
        And it still seems a bit of a puzzle in my mind why NATO used that label
        in 1968. And that&#8217;s such an early time within operating systems,
        within programming that it seems like it&#8217;s a curious early usage
        of that term. And I&#8217;m just curious whether you might have reflections
        on why or where that term came from.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I historically know that it occurred. It had been just part of my
        general knowledge things, which means it may be false, that the primary
        intent of using this term at the NATO meeting in Garmish is to declare
        that we have to move in this direction. Some people think that it was
        designed to be contentious, rather than aspirational. I tend to think
        it was aspirational, but then I live in the profession so I tend to give
        up a positive interpretation of this. The problem in the &#8216;60s,
        you&#8217;ve got to remember, [is] that the main frame became an entity
        in maybe 1956 which was by several universit[ies], so when you talk about
        1960... I graduated college in 1964 [and] there was no computer science
        department in the country in that time. So the business that we have
        to call attention to the standards, and that we ought to keep developing
        the standards, using &#8216;engineering&#8217; as a label is interesting
        because the people who do the history of engineering would say, &#8220;Those
        people who used it, and garnished it and made out,&#8221; misunderstood
        engineering. They thought engineering to be a fixed and stable and solid
        discipline where you open the rule book, you have the rule, this is what
        you do, and you do nothing else. There is no invention, or creativity
        in engineering. You have the standards and you apply this mathematically
        model and that&#8217;s it. And we&#8217;re in a building that had to
        violate some of those mathematical models right now, or had to do some
        variations on what those standards would have been. In Garmish, those
        people who look at engineers go, &#8220;Bridges work. Buildings don&#8217;t
        fall down. Software&#8217;s falling down. We should follow the &#8216;engineering
        model&#8217;.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Hence, software engineering, some of us use phrase like engineered software.
        I can tell you when I do safety critical systems for certain kinds of
        things or will have a great impact on society; I carry the engineering
        levels to a very high principle. That is the standards I know they&#8217;re
        applying. I think to worry about [the] Garmish use of the phrase may
        be interesting historically but the real transitions started to occur
        as software began to spread. People used to just gripe about the telephone
        bill, and the electric bill, and the machine that did this. Now they
        have pacemakers in their chest. They drive their car and their car is
        mostly computers. Most engines are controlled by computers and not by
        people. They travel down intersections where the flow of traffic is controlled
        by computers and scanners and the amount of traffic and calculations.
        And all of a sudden you have to worry about, &#8220;Wait a minute. We
        have people who are hired by companies who may have had no college education
        and not know any of these standards about good testing, writing software
        that affects the airplane I fly.&#8221; I flew in an airplane here today
        and fortunately we knew about a thunderstorm ahead of time. Thank you
        computer. It was a very comfortable ride because the computers directed
        the airplane to fly above the turbulence. Knowing all of this, you now
        have these great efficacy things that are going on by computers. And
        it is no longer acceptable to approach it in a haphazard fashion. </p>

      <p><strong><a name="bio"></a>Biographical Questions</strong></p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Don, I&#8217;d like to shift just a little bit and ask about your
        biography and your background. People of your generation ended up getting
        into computing from a variety of different places. You mentioned before
        that it wasn&#8217;t an established discipline of either software engineering
        or computer science. But surely you must have one of the strongest backgrounds
        of philosophy of anybody that I know doing software engineering, both
        a bachelors, masters, and a PH.D. in philosophy. A PH.D. in 1971 and
        then additional technical training in computing. Maybe you could say
        a few words about what prompted your interest in computing. Where that
        came from? And how you made the switch from philosophy to computing?
        And then I have additional follow up questions about how you got interested
        in software engineering and software engineering ethics. But can you
        describe a little bit about your background in philosophy and how you
        became interested first in computing as a field of practice? It doesn&#8217;t
      follow in my mind logically from David Hume. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>DG</strong>: Everything&#8230;There is another National Science Foundation research
        project on moral exemplars in computing that has me as a subject and
        it was insightful because of some of the questions I got asked. All of
        the questions and everything seem to fit if we take into consideration
        my father had what would be called a craftsman&#8217;s approach to everything.
        Everything you did should be thought out, should be organized, you avoid
        mistakes; it&#8217;s unacceptable to just jump into things in a silly
        way. That was driven into me, inspired me. I was also, given that approach,
        you look at all things as a problem to be solved and to be organized.
        I enjoyed looking at very large problems. I use to get myself in trouble
        with large problems because I would pick things that had been proven
        to be unsolvable and think that I had the ability to solve mathematical
        equations or do things of that sort. And I would always write papers
        on the hardest topics. It led me to studies of religious theories and
        trying to organize and structure large religious systems. Which led in
        part to the interest in philosophy and the approach was always an empirical,
        scientific approach. As a student growing up in New York, my high school
        days were at a special science high school in New York, again the nerd
        approach.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Which high school was that?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Newtown Technical High School. It&#8217;s the Borough of Queen&#8217;s
        version of the Bronx&#8217;s High School of Science and Brooklyn Tech
        and so on. Each borough had its own science high school. So I went to
        the local science high school. I was going to be a chemist at that point
        in my career, because I loved the way in which you could add chemicals
        together and calculate their structure ahead of time and predict certain
        kinds of relationships. Then some place along the way, I got interested
        in philosophy as a large structured system again. But my approach was
        always the empirical science piece. Experiment, test, get evidence, work
        it out, and develop the system. So lots of my philosophy was spent dealing
        with logic and writing out logical, structured arguments. </p>
      <p>Logical, structured arguments, (jumping way ahead) are very much like
        computer programs. In a logic argument you set up premises and give evidence
        for the premises, and you feed those premises into the next set of premises,
        and you change all those premises by drawing a conclusion and saying, &#8220;Here&#8217;s
        what the conclusion is.&#8221; A computer program or a computer system
        takes series of inputs, massages them throughout the program; in COBOL
        they are even called paragraphs, in paragraphs, and passes the output
        of that paragraph onto the next paragraph. It&#8217;s like writing a
        thesis.</p>
      <p>And all of the things I did had a common problem solving methodology,
        that&#8217;s me. You give me large difficult problems. So a lot of the
        systems I worked on were not small systems that fit in your pocket but
        systems that ran military systems that tracked munitions, database systems
        for police departments, and things of that sort. That&#8217;s the general
        characterization; I&#8217;ve finally come to realize that this characterizes
        what I do. Even now in my spare time, I do watercolor painting. And watercolor
        painting requires incredible up front problem solving because you have
        to anticipate what will happen when each color is mixed, when you put
        one color on top of another because there&#8217;s no correction and going
        back. And I find it laughable that my spare time, relaxation involves
        the same process. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: This is deeply imbedded in your habits of thought.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I say it even stronger than that. This is me. This is the person
        I am. Part of the craftsman&#8217;s model is certain things are not acceptable.
        And shoddiness, haphazard[ness] is not acceptable. </p>
      <p>Now how I got to what I&#8217;m now doing. One of the virtues of being
        a philosopher, and why it fit that mold, was if you wanted to do the
        philosophy of the relationship of subatomic particles, if you were a
        good enough philosopher, you could make that fit the subject and actually
        teach a course in it. One of the things I did there was a philosopher
        called David Hume, who talked about the way in which you gain knowledge.
        I particularly liked Hume because he always wanted to point to the evidence
        and say, &#8220;What do you see?&#8221; and it fit my mold. And it fit
        the mold of applying logic to solving problems. He also had some theories
        about causality and how one thing causes another. We won&#8217;t go into
        those here but that was one of my first papers on Hume. While still in
        graduate school, before I had even written my thesis, I had published
        a paper on Hume and causality. Now you look at computers, and when people
        in the early days started talking about the way computers worked and
        the computers as if they made decisions and had some kind of causal impact,
        I wanted to look at what was going on there. And so I began to look at
        computers, and read about them, and follow some material, and sit in
        on some classes at various universities. One of the great privileges
        of being, one of the great pleasantries, about being a college professor
        is your colleagues will let you sit in on their classes and learn things
        from them in your spare time, and if you get cut short and have to go
        back to work, they don&#8217;t object. So I was learning things about
        computing.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Did you have an early experience with a particular computer or computer
        system? Or was it more a general interest in systems of knowledge and
        types of evidence and the kind of logical...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Systems of knowledge and types of evidence...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: ...Rather than a piece of hardware that you may have had in high
      school?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: No. High school for me was 1956 to, no 1957 to
        1960. The piece of hardware we had at that point was the slide rule.
        There were no calculators
        at that point. Just as people carry their laptops to technical schools
        now as marks of intelligence, when we rode the trains to school you knew
        who went to Tech because we had our slide rule cases hanging on our sides
        as badges of, &#8220;We are the elite technicians. We are...&#8221; they
        didn&#8217;t have a word &#8216;nerd&#8217; at the time, but we were
      the technical nerds of that time but the engineers of society. </p>
      <p>So the answer about the hardware is that the hardware actually came
        late in the game, only playing a little bit with some of the hardware
        at the various schools. We&#8217;re talking schools having DEC PDP 11
        hardware that had 128 K in a mainframe that ran the university system.
        I&#8217;m talking 1970. PCs were not invented yet. The only hardware
        you could get to was mainframe computer stuff and of course since it
        carried university data that access was very limited and guarded. You
        could not play with the machine, so to speak. And people did not have,
        and I was not interested in the hardware even there were early PCs like
        Altar. I liked the large problems and addressing them.</p>
      <p>In philosophy, I was doing all right. No, it was a success. And I left
        the place...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: In your professional career...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: In my professional career as a philosopher. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Making publications and stuff. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I started at Wichita State University and they normally had a 7
        year run to tenure, and they were going to give me tenure in the fourth
        year to keep me there. And then I got a job offer from the University
        of Southern California to go to their School of Philosophy. I, not knowing
        much about the work world, went to the University of Southern California
        and encountered an environment that I found uncomfortable, because it
        was a political nightmare and you could not, if you tried to be a fully
        ethical human being, avoid difficulties. So I said, &#8220;I have [had]
        enough of this.&#8221; And there were other things going on with the
        family so I went back to Pennsylvania, I went to stay with family in
        Pennsylvania, my wife&#8217;s family.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Just to review those years you were at Wichita State during 1971
        to &#8216;74 and then you went to USC, the School of Philosophy...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: &#8216;74 to &#8217;76, I guess. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You were there either two or three years...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Two years.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: ...and you left to return to Harrisburg. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And in having...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You felt the environment at USC was very difficult politicized,
        or unethical in just some other way?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Politicized and there was some misrepresentation about the job that
        they were offering me. That is, I was going to have a certain leadership
        role and a certain function and... Well that&#8217;s enough said about
        that.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Okay. It was a combination of both, you&#8217;d say, family interests
        as well as professional dissatisfaction. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Professional dissatisfaction and the family interests, as you said.
        Also, my wife didn&#8217;t care for Los Angeles. We left Wichita where
        we were very comfortable, had some good friends. The Wichita philosophy
        department was quite aggressive in doing its philosophy and a quality
        department. After leaving, now you&#8217;re in this environment that&#8217;s
        not comfortable for my wife, and not comfortable for me, and it wasn&#8217;t
        professionally satisfying. I quit the University of Southern California
        without having a job in hand. And went to Harrisburg, which was a bad
        political move and a bad employment move.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Something of a risk I&#8217;d say.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: It had its bad and good points. It was time for one of those life
        decisions of, &#8220;What shall I do now.&#8221; And computers are getting
        more into the forefront. So you say, &#8220;Well, I can do that.&#8221; And
        that was all it took then. That&#8217;s all it takes now. You want to
        say, &#8220;I do software development,&#8221; get some paint, write get
        a sign, hang it outside your door, and you now are certified. Well not
        certified, but that&#8217;s what it takes. And so I did some...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You had auditing classes, both at Wichita State and USC?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Just USC. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Just USC?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Just USC. So by personal contacts and things you make some contacts
        with people. And you find that philosophy was wonderful problem solving
        training because you&#8217;d sit and talk with a businessman about what
        they needed, what they wanted in a system. And they&#8217;d say, &#8220;Well
        I have this accounting system that does such and such.&#8221; And you&#8217;d
        just listen to them describe their system, doing a logical analysis in
        your head of the system and realize that they&#8217;re taking a very
        circumspect route to do something simple. And they had taken that route
        because it had always been done that way. And you would simply say to
        them, &#8220;Well, is there a reason you don&#8217;t do it this way?&#8221; And
        they would think I was a business genius, which I always found humorous
        because I hadn&#8217;t had any business courses. And it was just the
        structure of their system that I would reorganize in my head while listening.
        And you would get a job. And they would be so pleased; they would recommend
        you to other people. But some of the work I wanted to do required that
        I have some credentials. So I went to the local community college. And
        in my spare time, while, I spoke about negative time. During that period
        of time, I was...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Negative time is that time you can&#8217;t put on the calendar but
        you squeeze out here and there. In the evenings, early in the morning?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Right. So the time consisted of teaching a course at Dickenson College
        as a professor, because one of the faculty members was on sabbatical
        they knew my record. That was teaching one course, the course he had
        to teach.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And it was a philosophy course?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes. I also taught a philosophy course at Harrisburg Area College
        because I was a cheap commodity and available. While taking classes in
        the data processing program, while working for other people, also raising
        a family and coaching soccer and other things, so I think they all fit
        into negative time. And if you ask what I did in those first two years
        in Harrisburg, it was set up some standards. I went to work and did some
        work with Blue Cross and worked for them, worked for the federal government
        actually as a federal government employee for a full year, and then went
      back out into consulting again. So it was quite a mixed bag.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>TM</strong>: With Blue Cross you were doing also computer and systems analysis...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Right, systems analysis work</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And with the federal government in Harrisburg, that wasn&#8217;t
        part of the state but with the federal government? </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: No it was the United States Navy Spare Parts Control Depot where
        I actually was an employee of theirs for one year. Training systems analysts,
        working on...working on some weapons systems, and doing work with nuclear
        submarines. And that&#8217;s a new set of ethics issues. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You were training systems analysts or doing training and doing
        analysis of systems?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I was training... I had a teaching function. I would periodically
        run courses for the Navy at the Navy Yard but my attachment was as a
        systems analyst to a particular division of the Navy Yard. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You&#8217;re not talking about the Philadelphia Navy Yard?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: No. Later after I left the Navy Depot I had contracts with the Philadelphia
        Navy Yard while it was still in existence. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: This was systems&#8217; work and were you aware at all at the time
        of there being people thinking about all these quality issues as sort
        of the problem with doing non-systems&#8217; analysis of programming?
        In other words, I&#8217;m trying to get a sense of where you&#8217;ve
        described your interest in logical systems and made a connection to computing,
        did you see yourself then primarily as somebody who&#8217;s interested
        in a special type of programming, this systems&#8217; analysis that we
        would now would understand as software engineering?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I was... Here&#8217;s now the connection to things I&#8217;ve said
        earlier. Earlier I had spoken about a haphazard approach to building
        systems. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Spaghetti code is one term you used.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Spaghetti code, just building systems without thinking of their
        impacts. The character that I&#8217;ve described to you earlier is Don
        Gotterbarn, the person who loves to solve complex systems. You can lose
        any awareness of the world as you get immersed into the complexity of
        the system. I was that human being. Let me solve the problem. I&#8217;ll
        solve the problem you give me and I think I will have done a wonderful
        job. The experience in Harrisburg was the education of Don Gotterbarn
        about systems work. Simple examples. Also in my spare time I did voluntary
        work up at the Camp Hill Public Library as a reference librarian. I had
        all this education, this academic knowledge which was not getting used
        in these other areas. And they also knew about my computing work. So
        one of the evenings the librarian is pulling books off the bookshelf
        and throwing them on this cart. She&#8217;s culling books that she believes
        were not checked out in the past two years. They&#8217;re going to be
        disposed of because they have to make room in this physical library for
        new books. They have to make shelf room. And I look at this woman and
        I say, &#8220;I just read that one last week.&#8221; And she says, &#8220;Oh,&#8221; and
        she puts it back. I ask, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have any way of knowing
        what was checked out in the past two years.&#8221; &#8220;No, but I work
        on this.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I can write you a program that will do
        this.&#8221; Their check out system was computerized and so I wrote a
        very, what we would call, quick and dirty program. When you checked the
        book out, it would take the record of checking it out, take that whole
        record it was about to write and write it to my database. And then we
        checked that list against the existing list of books and we could see
        which books were not checked out in two years. A simple program, a wonderful
        solution., done with the best intentions.</p>
      <p>We had some trouble around the library and the police wanted to know
        what a particular young lad had checked out. And I was there when someone
        said, &#8220;Oh, well we can use Don&#8217;s program to do that. Can&#8217;t
        we Don?&#8221; And I realized is that what I had done was to take the
        complete record; person&#8217;s name, address, phone number and the book
        they checked out and recorded that along with the date. And my program
        only needed the book and the date. And because of the way I had designed
        that program the police were able to intrude in a way that I thought
        unacceptable for the reasons that they had. </p>
      <p>There are several of those kinds of experiences that I had, both personally
        and watching others. And you go, &#8220;I&#8217;m developing software
        in a haphazard way.&#8221; I&#8217;m seeing others not bother to educate
        themselves and keep up on the latest technology and changes. They&#8217;re
        developing them not just in a haphazard way about impact, but a haphazard
        way about a system. And this I think is -maybe it&#8217;s the ethics
        education, maybe it&#8217;s the professionalism education- you&#8217;re
        developing a bad system by definition, or a failed system; one if it
        doesn&#8217;t work, two if it&#8217;s functions have negative, unintended
        negative impacts on other people, if you develop it in a haphazard way,
        not considering those impacts. That people now call computer ethics.
        I bring to that my value systems about human beings. And now what I do
        is, you now have Don interested in professional ethics without having
        any vehicle or outlet for it except some of the organizations joining
        the ACM and joining the Data Processing Management Association and groups
        of that sort. That&#8217;s where all of a sudden the fields began to
        connect. I think I&#8217;ve answered that question. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: That&#8217;s your connection to software engineering and software
        ethics. Could I just stay with that for a moment, you said that this
        experience where you recognized that without thinking about, that&#8217;s
        the problem; you hadn&#8217;t been thinking about the consequences, you&#8217;d
        design a system that would basically be an invasion of somebody&#8217;s
        privacy. Library records are considered to be private records. They&#8217;re
        not part of a public record. They shouldn&#8217;t be part of a police,
        sort of, fishing scheme in the absence of&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And this particular one it was a teenager that was particularly
        obnoxious that the police were after and looking for anything to get
        after this obnoxious teenager. There was no terrorist or really justification.
        It was just a hassle. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: They were looking for anything. You said there were other examples
        that led you to a more general formulation that sort of predisposed you
        to looking towards a moralful listing even in systems, but a kind of
        ethical approach. Anything else from your personal life, your Harrisburg
        years, or you consulting years where you have particularly vivid examples
        either from yourself or other software colleagues that maybe you can
        recall? That prompted your kind of reevaluation, your broadening of the
        perspective. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Issues, they range from strikingly minor ones to major ones. One
        of the issues with Blue Cross was the issue of health insurance and then
        abortions at the time and that period of time. We&#8217;re talking the
        mid &#8216;70s to early &#8216;80s. Where a medical record was kept of
        a particular subscriber&#8217;s daughter who was going to college in
        another state and he had all of a sudden received that he had to pay
        a portion of a medical bill. The girl had gotten an abortion covered
        by her medical insurance or a portion of the medical insurance. The information
        was supposed to be kept confidential, and because of the design of the
        system, her father found out about this particular thing that caused
        particular horrendous problems in their family relationship and so on,
        and exploded in all sorts of ugly ways with lawsuits and challenges and
        things of this sort. And again it was the way the system was managed,
        a simple kind of data protection issue. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Do you find it difficult, I&#8217;m not talking about you now as
        a professional I&#8217;m talking about you as somebody who&#8217;s interested
        in the craft of programming, is there a certain quality about the challenge
        of a small and narrowly defined problem that none the less makes it a
        temptation to take on a project like that? That you have to balance your
        interest and intrigue at solving particular narrow technical problems
      against the broader understanding of the consequences?</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>DG</strong>: Always a challenge. Always, I mean, it&#8217;s part of the thing,
        this group of doctors, the group of administrators at a particular hospital
        asked me if I could develop what they call a patient treatment form.
        That is, when you go in as a patient and you go in with pneumonia you&#8217;re
        supposed to get this, that, and the other, when you go into cardiac you&#8217;re
        supposed to get this, that, and the other. And there were some interesting
        ways in putting together the form that you&#8217;re listening to this
        and going, &#8220;I can solve that. I know how to do that.&#8221; And
        the challenge is very exciting. And then you hear them say, &#8220;And
        this is going to get used by us to keep medical costs down.&#8221; And
        you feel that&#8217;s a good idea and, &#8220;How will it do that?&#8221; Well,
        when a doctor prescribes a medication that&#8217;s not on this form,
        the nurse will contact the doctor again to say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not
        on the form. Do you have special reasons for this?&#8221; And if the
        doctor doesn&#8217;t give adequate reasons then no matter what the doctor&#8217;s
        name and the special medication will get written on a list because he&#8217;s
        violated the standard that&#8217;s written on this form. At which point
        you say, &#8220;So if a patient is in intensive care for cardiac problems
        and the doctor, if the doctor prescribes penicillin?&#8221; &#8220;Oh
        yes, the form will check that and that&#8217;s not standard care.&#8221; And
        you say, &#8220;But my father when he was in cardiac care got pneumonia
        and they gave him emergency doses of penicillin. So you mean the nurse
        would override the doctor&#8217;s instruction until she could contact
        him? Won&#8217;t that kill people? Do you really have all of these symptoms
        and medicines laid out concretely? Because you&#8217;re introducing a
        delayed exam like it&#8217;s life threatening to me.&#8221; And these
        folks were just interested in the financial end of cutting expenses,
        catching the doctors who were using their professional skills to do things
        outside the norm when necessary. And that was one of those contracts
        where I said, &#8220;Thank you, no. I&#8217;m not doing it, nor should
        you.&#8221; But part of my &#8220;nor should you&#8221; was heavy education
        with them and other work doing that. So yes, it was an interesting problem,
        and you do it or you think you&#8217;re going to do if because of an
        interesting problem. And some of them that I&#8217;ve turned down, I&#8217;ve
      sat down and done just as mental gymnastics. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Because of the...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Just because...it&#8217;s an interesting problem. It&#8217;s an
        interesting problem painting a painting in a single color. And I will
        paint whole scenes in a single color just to check skills, and you get
        distracted. I&#8217;m getting distracted. Let me go back to your questions.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: In the early 1980s there were questions about not only the system,
        the most controversial piece of computer software that I have been aware
        of, or have ever was aware of, was the Strategic Defense Initiative.
        Did that play a role in your deliberation? </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes. In my history, I stopped doing consulting as an independent
        and went and worked for this bank in northeast Pennsylvania. And again
        it was developing system problems and so on. And then, went into teaching
        university but this time in computer science in northwest Pennsylvania.
        Now the location is important because it&#8217;s an hour and a half&#8217;s
        drive north of Pittsburgh. So Pittsburgh became the intellectual center
        you could go to. You knew people at Carnegie Mellon; you did some work
        with them in philosophy. Carnegie Mellon is a major university. Pittsburgh
        has a large population so people can take on radical causes and don&#8217;t
        feel the difficulty of being viewed negatively by other people. 1983,
        the Strategic Defense Initiative gets announced by President Regan, and
        it gets very scary because one of the things you&#8217;ve learned is
        when you build a system, one of the things you need is a clear set of
        requirements to build the system. And President Regan gave as the totality
        of his clear system, build a shield that will defend the United States,
        make it impervious from the attack of the Red Menace or whatever he called
        it. This as a detail specification is inadequate. It got taken on as
        meaning a million different things by a million different people. Some
        saw it as [a] financial benefit to their university to get a research
        program, even if they didn&#8217;t believe it could be done. Some who
        said computers aren&#8217;t quite there yet to do this sort of thing.
        And the trust in computing despite the evidence against that trust. What
        was exciting and was probably a major critical element in my background
        was that an organization called CPSR, Computer Professionals for Software
        Responsibility...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Social Responsibility. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Social Responsibility.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: CPSR.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: ...Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility developed, and
        that was again a mixed bag of people. All of the raging anarchists who
        were anti-government and had nothing better to do but to scream and wave &#8220;we
        hate the government&#8221; flags. But what was more interesting was the
        number of computer professionals of great repute that said when speaking
        of SDI, &#8220;This is unacceptable. We can&#8217;t do this.&#8221; And
        I smile and go, &#8220;Yes. There are others concerned practitioners
        out there and I am not alone.&#8221; You have the feeling, when I was
        developing a computer ethics course at Allegany College where I was at
        the time, and people were always fond of joking, &#8220;Computer ethics?
        Well computers aren&#8217;t human so they have no ethics?&#8221; was
        the standard, mindless joke. And one of the things, I don&#8217;t think
        I&#8217;m an especially brave individual so it was nice to know that
        there other people out there with similar kinds of views, and that I
        was not just a raving lunatic doing these things, saying, &#8220;When
        you develop systems, you need moral responsibility.&#8221; So I joined
        the CPSR group in Pittsburgh and worked with them for a bit. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And when would that have been?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: When I was at Allegany so it was &#8217;84&#8230; &#8217;83, &#8217;84.
        I&#8217;m going to have the years wrong. When I was at Allegany. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Mid &#8216;80s.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: There you go, mid &#8216;80s, &#8216;84, &#8217;85, &#8217;86, mid &#8217;80s.
        And it was something that became difficult to do but I had fun teaching
        the students in the computer ethics course. Because what we would do
        is, in the computer ethics course in Pittsburgh the Jarvik heart, a computerized-mechanical
        heart, had just been invented and I told the students at Allegany college
        in my ethics class that we&#8217;d just been offered ability to work
        and test the Jarvik heart and do computing with that. After they got
        over the initial excitement the students started saying, &#8220;But we
        don&#8217;t understand anything about that. We shouldn&#8217;t test this
        kind off... We&#8217;re not really competent to do this because we don&#8217;t
        know this area.&#8221; And then you start relating the questions to the
        Strategic Defense Initiative and they would go, &#8220;Oh. We shouldn&#8217;t
        do that for exactly the same reasons should we.&#8221; And they found
        moral outrage at my suggestion that we, starting students in computing,
        work on a Jarvik heart that would affect an individual human life. And
        then when you started to look at the Strategic Defense Initiative, which
        had at that time putting nuclear devices in space, as the same kind of
        thing, even more criminal.</p>
      <p>So yes, that had a very strong influence.</p>
      <p><strong>TM:</strong> Did you find networks with people within CPSR that you found common
        cause with that developed into colleagues? You&#8217;re professionally
        active in a professional field of computer ethics, but did you find people
        mostly through computers or additionally also through CPSR? You said
        that there are&#8230;</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>DG</strong>:<strong> </strong>The CPSR one, the period of time is important. These were at places
          like MIT and at Stanford and places and things like that. So I&#8217;ve
          done some work with some of the people at Stanford but not Joseph Weizenbaum
          at MIT who had, who is one of the early folks who, I think I&#8217;ve
          left out of this mix, also inspired me because in 1976&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>[end of tape 1 side B]</strong>      
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Okay, back on tape. Tom Misa interviewing Don Gotterbarn. We&#8217;re
        going to focus for the next little bit here on some of the intellectual
        sources that sort of framed Don&#8217;s interest in software engineering
        and precluded ethical problem. And he&#8217;s talked about three different
        people that we&#8217;re sort of pick up on; Joseph Weizenbaum, Douglas
        Hofstadter and Deborah Johnson. So if you want to start with Joseph Weizenbaum
      and&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: In this period of time when I was moving from philosophy into computing
        and starting to do things in a way where I just regarded or primarily
        regarded computing as problem solving and intellectual problems, I came
        across Weizenbaum s book, Computer Power and Human Reason and I loved
        it because it was written by a technician and it was technically sound,
        but he also kept using words like &#8220;responsibility&#8221;. And it
        began to, as I tied it to things I was doing for various people, make
        it clear that what I thought were simple suggestions to business folks
        about how they revise their business was in fact changing the way they
        did business and how they interacted with people. As I was developing
        communication systems with Blue Cross, it had the same kinds of concepts.
        And that book was a sensitizer about the way I should be going. </p>
      <p>That and the same period of time, I came across a wonderful tome by
        Douglas Hofstadter, &#8220;G&ouml;del, Escher, and Bach.&#8221; Now this
        man is talking to me, who at that moment was teaching philosophy, was
        doing some volunteer tutoring, was developing systems as community service,
        and was earning a living writing computer programs. G&ouml;del Escher,
        and Bach tied together all of these in one lump, and began to give me
        an insight as to how foolish I was to try and to keep any of these separate,
        and I needed to be thinking in all things at once to really develop quality
        systems.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: How did Hofstadter make that link for you? You saw that in his work.
        Can you say a little bit more in why you saw those three as being linked?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I remember that impression from the Hofstadter book. The particular
        things, the issues of problem solving, the issues of incompleteness,
        the issues of not seeing the whole picture, I mean the Escher model of &#8220;you
        think you see the picture and you look at it somewhere else&#8221;. I
        think in fact his discussions of the Escher, what is now my favorite
        Escher work, is Relativity, where you are have people walking around
        in a monastery and you look at them and they&#8217;re walking in the
        same direction but because of one thing it looks like the person is walking
        up the stairs just because of your perspective, and the other looks like
        is walking down the stairs. And you begin realize that if you don&#8217;t
        develop computer systems that take into account all of these perspectives
        you&#8217;re not going to have one that will work well. That in many
        places&#8230; it will have one that will fail in interesting ways; some
        disastrous, some just your system will never get used. And of course
        the Bach of the beauty of the rhythms is wonderful, but don&#8217;t just
        listen to the beauty of the music because if you turn the beautiful music
        too loud, you&#8217;ll deafen people. So you&#8217;ve got to have the
        balance along with this elegance. And I think those are some of the lessons
        I took away and we&#8217;re now talking 30 years from those moments in
        my intellectual history so I can&#8217;t give you the details of the
        book but I know that those two books at that period were quite significant. </p>
      <p>And I also from the philosophy background knew Deborah Johnson who was
        working on a book in computer ethics at the time. And she and I meet
        at a philosophy conference in New York, prior&#8230; I can&#8217;t put
        a date on it, but it was before her book was published, just before the
        book was published, so I guess around &#8217;83 or &#8217;84. So that&#8217;s
        the same period of time when SDI has its influences on me. As this it
        isn&#8217;t just my worry about silly mistakes I&#8217;ve made, it looks
        like, and I knew others who had made similar kinds of mistakes. But you
        look and you say, &#8220;The government is making that kind of mistake
        based on a mistaken belief about the capabilities of computer software.&#8221; Or
        what I believe is the mistaken belief about that.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: I don&#8217;t recall but I don&#8217;t think Weizenbaum talked at
        all about SDI or anything like that in his book.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: His book was written&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: What else do you critique of artificial intelligence?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: The book was written in the &#8216;70s. So SDI wasn&#8217;t a concept&#8230;SDI
        became full born March 23 of 1983 I think was when the president made
        his speech and sprung that on the world.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: These are different strings that are jelling in your mind.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I mean I&#8217;m doing&#8230; It was my ethical responsibility,
        and my not having the language or the philosophical terms to talk about
        professionalism, so I use the term craftsmanship at the moment. But craftsmanship
        involves a not failed bit of software and not failed means more than
        it does the function that was described by a client or a customer. Not
        failed means it has no negative side effects on society and that it meets
        all these other standards that we&#8217;ve spoken about for the past
        couple of hours. The interesting SDI piece is that the group in Pittsburgh
        contained a lot of, how do we characterized this politely, it contained
        a lot of anarchistic, undisciplined rhetoric. And I was interested because
        I wanted to demand [a] disciplined approach to software development and
        following the commitments. So the support that came from that group was
        primarily the awareness that there were other people were doing it, other
        people interested in the same kind of thing, and my attention to these
        things was not crazy. That also gets added to, well at this point I&#8217;m
        at Allegany College and we start to get some connections with the Software
        Engineering Institute as it begins to arise in 1986 was I think the original
        seeds there&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: At Carnegie Mellon...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: At Carnegie Mellon, in Pittsburgh, which was just again south of
        where I was. And the connections&#8230; I left Allegany College and went
        to Wichita State in 1988 where there was no interest or support in the
        ethics issue. And my being asked at the summer of my first year Wichita
        State to develop software engineering ethics course material as a visiting
        scientist at the Software Engineering Institute was received non-positively.
        I had been acting chairman of the department and asked&#8230; and what
        it would have required was going to Pittsburgh for six weeks that summer
        developing material. And there was some concern about how I would manage
        the department at a distance and so on. <br>
        This has taken me to an important point. The material, the whole event
        at the Software Engineering Institute in that six weeks did some positive
      things&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You went to SEI?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I went to SEI to work as a visiting scientist for six weeks in the
        summer developing these materials. It gave me some acquaintance with
        several people who were also working in the area in a variety of ways.
        We started this process by having a three day workshop at the Software
        Engineering Institute and that&#8217;s where I met Keith Miller originally
        so that dates our relationship, our relationship dates back to 1989.
        And I also meet Laurie Worth from Texas who had strong interest in the
        same area, Joyce Currie Little, James Tomayko who plays an interesting
        role in this story that kind of dropped, who was in favor of ethics in
        project management and the ethics approach, and Tomayko I had also known
        from Wichita State. The positive things were coming in touch and contact
        with these people and meeting these people. For a variety of reasons
        after the ethics material was developed it was decided not to be used
        as a curriculum module by the Software Engineering Institute. </p>
      <p>The work at the SEI had some, an interesting mix of consequences. The
        normal way of developing these curriculum models are that what&#8217;s
        large gets developed, they get presented at conferences, they get reviewed
        and distributed. So in connection with the development of this module
        and the SEI over the next year or so I presented this at faculty development
        workshops in Kansas and in Florida that were sponsored by the SEI. So
        I then gathered a network of people who were interested in this and understood
        what I was interested in. The effort and the arguments in this got some
        publicity and made some significant connections in that regard. The misfortune
        was the SEI for a variety of reasons decided not to pursue this as a
        curriculum module and gave the copyright of all of the materials in that
        project back to me. But the seed had been set in many places. And so
        now there was material available, being distributed, there were cases,
        there were approaches to how you would do computer ethics as a professional
        computer person. And you were not necessarily required to be a philosopher
        or teaching a philosophy course. And there were regular examples of how
        this would be relevant to the computer science person. I was not the
        only person doing this. My connection with Keith Miller at that time
        was significant, because Keith had been doing that in his own courses.
        So we got together and collaborated in a variety of ways. </p>
      <p>But there is an important interlude that occurs. When I returned to
        Wichita, there was a political turn. And the interest in software engineering
        was eliminated. In that next year at Wichita, eleven of us who were interested
        out of seventeen of who were interested in software development left
        that school and went elsewhere because of the lack of support for software
        engineering. And I will leave those comments there. The rest of that
        is irrelevant. What is relevant is that I went from there to East Tennessee
        State University. In thinking about this whole project and all of what
        went on, that is probably one of the most critical elements in putting
        together the Software Engineering Code although it sounds not relevant
        at the moment. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So that would be the most&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Having gone to that particular university was critical in getting
        this thing done.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: East Tennessee.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Going to East Tennessee State University.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Can you explain why?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: At East Tennessee State University they already had a computer ethics
        course on the books, one for graduates and one for undergraduates. In
        its style it was a broader computer ethics course than I had been dealing
        with because I had focused on computer ethics for professionals. Nevertheless,
        no one had to be convinced that computer ethics was important. Everybody
        who hired me there knew of my interest in this and works in this area.
        They had heard me talk at various conferences. And so there was an understanding
        of some of my points of view and they were not contentious nor were they
        considered outside of computer science. The support that&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: This is a very supportive environment&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Incredibly supportive institution and environment. And as I look
        back on it, had they not been this supportive this would not have happened.
        I can remember some of my days at Wichita where I tried to get funding
        to attend a conference on ethics or to present something on ethics and
        there was not money except if it was computer science related. Ethics
        was not considered by them to be computer science related. My visit to
        the Software Engineering Institute was totally funded by the Software
        Engineering Institute, not Wichita. I moved to East Tennessee State University
        and one of the first things I participated in was a conference in 1991
        at Southern Connecticut State University which was called The National
        Conference on Computing and Values, where all of a sudden my network
        is vastly enlarged and I met, the number is wrong but I will say at least
        100 people who are doing work in this area around the country. You get
        immediately involved in the development of a project developing the ACM
        Code of Ethics and Professional Practice. You find people who are willing
        to listen to your points of view about development, about placing items
        of practice into this normative code that says, &#8220;Try to write good
        software,&#8221; and as you stick items of practice in they get put in
        as guidelines into this code. So the code becomes a two level code; high
        level normative statements, low level codes of practice. You work with
        Ron Anderson, a sociologist from Minnesota, who had a grant from the
        ACM to revise the ACM Code of Ethics and you learn a wonderful amount
        of things from him about the politics of getting professional societies
        to do things; how to avoid stepping on toes, how to move things along
        successfully, what elements of your discussions you make public and what
        ones you keep private, and the way in which you have to negotiate every
        level. One of the things that comes out of that is an understanding of,
        on my part, of what you put in public documents and how you color them
        in order to avoid catastrophe, avoid misunderstanding. How you just present
        what is relevant to the relevant parties and the work goes on where the
        private issues and private debates are kept private. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So Ron Anderson had experience not merely in writing the code but
        also in having it, moving it through ACM?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: That&#8217;s what we were engaged in doing. In that meeting, at
        that conference in 1990 I met Ron Anderson and worked with him on developing
        the code that got finished in October of 1992. </p>
      <p>I also met Walter Maner and Terry Bynum both people who had been working
        in computer ethics for a long time. And I will go on; if I start to do
        this list it will get too long. But Gene Spafford, Eugene Spafford, and
        Terry Winograd also belong on that list. And Dianne Martin belongs on
        that list. Dianne Martin I would later work with, she would be president
        of the Special Interest Group in Computers and Society, Computers and
        Society and I was her vice president. Terry Bynum and I are now both
        visiting; Terry Bynum developed his own ethics center. I developed mine
        after his model. Walter Maner and I have worked on NSF grants related
        to ethics. This was quite a fertile seeding that got done at this conference
      for my work.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: This is all things that came out of this National Conference...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: National Conference on Computing and Values.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: At Southern...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Southern Connecticut State University. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Must have been an amazing place. Well an amazing experience to have
        met all these people.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: The event was designed to develop teaching materials so there were
        different topic groups like privacy issues, and security issues, and
        professionalism issues, and teaching ethics class issues. And each of
        them had workshops going on where they would produce documents, which
        had the grant funding supported, producing these documents and then distributing
        them because the issue of ethics had now moved to the forefront, and
        people wanted to be able to teach it. There was a very non-altruistic
        reason for this. It has to do with an effort by Gene Spafford who is
        on that list of people. The ACM had developed a curriculum for computer
        science accreditation. I&#8217;ve said this, I&#8217;ve got this wrong.
        The ACM had developed a curriculum for computer science. In that curriculum
        was that you must include 15 hours of social and ethical issues. That
        was Gene Spafford&#8217;s insert I believe. That changed the world for
        computer science because now to be a program that was recognized in some
        way you had to include 15 hours, and very few people, other than those
        at this conference, know how to do it. And half of those at this conference
        came because they were going to be the assigned person who had to take
        care of that 15 hours of contact where you did ethics and social issues.
        So they were there to learn from us.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So the science of the conference reflected this ACM mandate, in
        effect. And I&#8217;m just making sure that I understand the denomination,
        15 credit hours?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: 15 hours of, 15 contact hours. So 3 weeks... if you need 3 hours
        a week, 5 weeks sometime in their career of course material would cover
        social issues. Could be distributed among courses, you could have a course
        that met for 5 weeks, 3 hours a week and you did away with it. And so
        that was the standard. I have to be careful, many...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Excuse me Don. One hour on a semester basis is the same?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Right.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: One hour a week for 15 weeks would be the 15 hours or...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: That was the Virginia Tech model for a while. But I have to be careful
        how I say this. Not most, not half, but a number of the people at this
        conference came to learn. All of us came to learn because there were
        all sorts of wonderful other people there. But the recording, and gathering,
        and preserving of the information was vital. What occurred were things
        like video tapes were put together; video tapes were done and then put
        together after the conference. And Southern Connecticut distributed something
        called the Computer Ethics Starter Kit, which was a series of video tapes;
        some of them discussing &#8220;What is computer ethics&#8221;, some of
        them giving ethics issues, some of them talking about how to teach computer
        ethics. And so people like Keith Miller, Deborah Johnson, Don Gotterbarn,
        Walter Maner Dianne Martin were all on these video tapes. And if teachers
        didn&#8217;t know what to say they would sometimes simply show the video
        tape to their classes. This was a real seed. It was also a change in
        my visibility, I think. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: To appear on tape in this structured way...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Well to appear on tape, to meet all these people, to connect up
        with writing of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, because
        now I was starting to, even though I lived in Johnson City, Tennessee,
        a town of 50,000 people, I was now connected up with a whole network
        of ethics people in the United States. Some of my work was known, and
        I think I did okay so some of it was respected. </p>
      <p>And the world began to change at that point. I got invited to a conference...
        The kinds of things that shape what goes on are amazing. I got invited
        to a conference at Rose Holman University, I&#8217;m going to get the
        date wrong, but I think it was early I think in this period of &#8217;91
        to &#8217;92, which was called the GTE Ethics Lectures. Gene Spafford,
        Deborah Johnson and I were the three people who invited to give three
        consecutive lectures, maybe a week apart. At that lecture, before that
        lecture I put together an article arguing about the nature of computer
        ethics as being not a universal kind of issue related to every issue
        about computing, but that computer ethics, I argued vigorously for computer
        ethics being strictly about ethics of a computer professional. I took
        a very narrow, vigorous argument which had the anticipated effect. </p>
      <p>The argument was... I have fun with it in my classes now because I have
        my students read it and I have them read it after we go over logical
        fallacies. And they immediately spot, shows the success of the first
        lecture and they&#8217;re afraid to say it, the fallacy of this because
        what I do is I refute a then fairly common view about computer ethics
        that is just for preventing you from being a bad guy. And I argue on
        the other extreme that computer ethics is only about helping you be a
        good guy, to avoid the kinds of problems I hit. And they learn that wait
        a minute that&#8217;s a case of the black and white fallacy, computer
        ethics is this range. And it&#8217;s wonderful to do in a computer ethics
        class because they&#8217;ve refuted the professor but they&#8217;ve also
        in that same moment committed themselves to the breadth of the issues. </p>
      <p>So it&#8217;s a little bit sneaky to do but that paper was important
        because it took shots at someone named Donn, D-O-N-N, Parker who had
        said, &#8220;There is no such thing as computer ethics because computer
        people are all bad guys,&#8221; or something like that. It argued vigorously
        and gave arguments for my one side; it didn&#8217;t show that the other
        side wasn&#8217;t there but those arguments set a case for a domain of
        computer ethics that had been not strongly advocated at the time. That
        is, if you write a book on computer ethics you have to include a section
        on professionalism. And that&#8217;s been one of the things that has
        been, I&#8217;ve been identified with; the push for professionalism.
        That paper has gotten cited places, repeated and anthologized in textbooks.
        And it&#8217;s always fun because today when I go and meet people and
        we talk about computer ethics, if they have just recently reviewed that
        paper they gently say to me, &#8220;Don, do you still hold that view?&#8221; And
        you have to explain that you were responding to a position that said
        computer ethics was just about bad people and so the easiest way to get
        attention, biblical concept of hyperbole, is to go on the extreme opposite
        view as strong as you could. And people would look at your arguments,
        even if they softened them, some of them would be considered... I&#8217;m
        losing track.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: I have a specific question about Donn Parker, the fellow who you
        were attacking. Was this part of a counter-cultural criticism of technology?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: No, Donn Parker was a, is a, I think he might still be around; he
        was an expert in security. And he was one of the people who looked at
        the bad guy stuff. And he wrote actually the first sort of book on computer
        ethics. He wrote a book that says, &#8220;Here&#8217;s this case. Here&#8217;s
        this cases. Here&#8217;s this case,&#8221; and he got a bunch of people
        together from a variety of disciplines. And he had this question, &#8220;Is
        this an issue of ethics, or it might be an issue of ethics, or isn&#8217;t
        an issue of ethics, or absolutely isn&#8217;t an issue,&#8221; and they
        voted on it. And it was a description of the particular behavior of people
        related to computers. And then he did this first round.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Of the computer...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Voting. They voted on, things like, &#8220;If this computer guy
        stole from the bank, this computer guy cheated and defrauded money to
        get money for his mother&#8217;s very expensive medicine,&#8221; and
        all sorts of issues that were very social broad and so on. And then he
        did this first round of votes and then culled the cases to those where
        there was the most disagreement and did another round of votes. And then
        surprised in his book, &#8220;Ah, there is no agreement on what is computer
        ethics,&#8221; and all this kind of stuff. And my argument in that paper
        was something about well what he was doing was picking people from, a
        psychologist, a philosopher, a bank manager, a computer person. And you&#8217;re
        not going to get an agreement about the focus on a certain detail except
        in extreme cases. And what he was labeling as computer ethics was just
        these kinds of frauds. </p>
      <p>Now that was the first book and it served a function that was a little
        bit positive because it got some attention but negative because it did
        the opinion poll type of things, like you determine truths in computer
        ethics by having uninformed votes. And yeah similar to the way news stations
        in the US now determine truth by saying, &#8220;Should somebody do this
        today? Call in and give us your vote and we&#8217;ll let you know the
        conclusion.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Seventy-three percent of people...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And those are totally uniformed votes and no rational structure
        and so on. And another book had come out by Forrester and Morrison which
        was a collection of bad guy stuff which had it had no ways in which it&#8217;d
        reason in ethics, no ways in which it&#8217;d think about ethics. So
        this paper I wrote in &#8217;91 criticized that whole genre, and said, &#8220;Look
        we can do things with reason and look there are professionals.&#8221; That
        gave me another level of publicity outside the department, but the department
        paid for that trip to go to Connecticut. It was a respectable and honorable
        thing to do. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: There was no fighting. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: This is back to the supportive environment.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes, the supportive environment. It is... It is amazing. If I were
        still at Wichita State...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: A department chair that was responsible for this or who, or how
        did this very supportive institutional environment take shape? Do you
        know?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I think it primarily came out of the department. Where you&#8217;re
        limited... Deans look at are the departments doing things that bring
        attention and money. Departments focus on are we doing the things that
        departments should be doing. So we had a department chair who loved to
        teach programming but also had students look at codes of ethics. We had
        a highly respected colleague who taught the computer ethics course, graduate
        course and undergraduate course. We had... The computer department was
        a very applied computer department. We developed systems. It was less
        theoretically oriented. So the argument of professionalism as I&#8217;ve
        characterized it was an easy case to make with that group of people.
        And the dean was of course happy that the department was getting national
        attention.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Responding to an urgent problem and getting publicity that would
        be envious. Did you teach computer ethics there?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Not, the other person taught computer ethics for a while actually.
        And I&#8217;m not sure how we ended up shifting out but he, but we worked
        together, we&#8217;d written papers on ethics and so on. We got a grant
        together for the Department of Defense, DAPRA, the DAPRA agency and so
        on about software engineering and building things in there.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: What courses did you teach when you went to East Tennessee?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: When I went to East Tennessee I went there to set up their master&#8217;s
        of software engineering program following the model of the Software Engineering
        Institute. So I taught several of the graduate courses; project management,
        project design, database. I taught some undergraduate programming courses.
        The complete collection. And this ethics stuff in the first couple of
        years was fit into what we call negative time at the moment. </p>
      <p>The support was just not a question. They would go out of their way
        to do things. Work I did on the Code of Ethics, work I did on... Ninety
        percent of the cost of my work on the Software Engineering Code of Ethics
        was probably borne by the ETSU Computer Science Department. I got occasional
        snippets of money from the combined group but when it was to go to a
        conference in Nashville, to go to a conference in Boston, to do those
        kinds of things where I was meeting with people about the Software Engineering
        Code of Ethics, was covered by them. To go to Boston for the final adventure
        with the ACM Code of Ethics that I was working on with Ron Anderson,
        was paid for by them. </p>
      <p>Now that story... The ACM Code of Ethics, lots of email was done. It
        was done in various meetings in various places. So we had meetings in
        Dallas, Texas at the NECC Conference. We had meetings in Boston at a
        conference where we&#8217;d get together with Ron Anderson and others
        of us who could do it. And to do this quickly, there was a critical moment
        that occurred in the whole ACM Code of Ethics, where it looked like it
        might fail at the very last moment. There were some negative signals
        sent to Ron Anderson a week before the ACM council was supposed to vote.
        And the negative signals were sent by people in power on the ACM council
        that they weren&#8217;t going to vote for this. We had written a normative
        code of ethics with some guidelines. The previous code had been a disciplinary
        code that said, &#8220;You shall use this method and if you don&#8217;t
        you&#8217;re out of the society. You shall use this method,&#8221; and
        so on. And the people who like that...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: A method that would be a certain..</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Software development, or follow this procedure, and it was quite
        disciplinary. And they liked that because it was easy to make the decision.
        You follow this line or you didn&#8217;t. And if you were a computer
        professional you look at the list and you said, &#8220;What do I do?&#8221; Normative
        codes give you guidelines. And sometimes there&#8217;s judgment involved.
        So the challenge was that, &#8220;Could this be done? Could this code
        be used?&#8221; Anderson had to prove that the code could be used in
        decision making. Otherwise it probably wasn&#8217;t going to pass the
        council meeting and the whole effort would be squashed. Ron Anderson,
        wonderful general, he called Deborah Johnson and I and said, &#8220;You
        have to come up to Boston now. We have an emergency. Bring all of the
        case examples you use in your classes.&#8221; I told the department, &#8220;I
        have to go up to Boston on an ACM emergency related to the Code of Ethics.&#8221; Covered
        and funded. </p>
      <p>What the emergency was, was in three days in a room in Boston the three
        of us and Judy Perrolle, a sociologist, came in on one of the days, put
        together a paper, which is also published all over the place, called &#8220;Using
        the ACM Code of Ethics in Decision Making&#8221;. We wrote that paper
        using our case examples, Ron Anderson sitting with a laptop, typing,
        and word-smithing, and fixing what Deborah and I were offering. Raising
        good questions and tying it all together. We printed that thing out on
        a Thermax heat printer the day before the conference, the council meeting.
        The day before, that morning we had it printed up in the business office
        at the Plaza Hotel, I think, in Boston, the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston.
        And when the ACM council came into the meeting room that morning they
        was sitting in front of, each person, a paper authored by Ron Anderson,
        Debra Johnson, Don Gotterbarn, and Judy Perrolle right next to the ACM
        Code of Ethics. And the title of the paper was &#8220;Using the ACM Code
        of Ethics in Decision Making&#8221;. And our request was to approve the
        Code of Ethics and approve this document to be printed in the Communications
        of the ACM as a guide to using the Code of Ethics in decision making.
        Beautiful.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Can you give an example of the use in decision making? That is,
        you wanted it to be practical, to give guidelines not just to be disciplinary
      as you pointed out. Can you give us an example?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: One is &#8220;Don&#8217;t cause harm&#8221;. Guidelines explaining
        to a computer person in 1992 what causing harm is. Causing harm is destruction
        of other people&#8217;s files. We&#8217;re not talking about a physical
        harm. Causing harm is depriving them of access to their computer and
        so on. Given a case, Mary writes a system that would display news relevant
        to sailing or something like that, and the system has a fixed sized font
        on the display that is .8 font that lots of good vision computer nerds
        can read. But people with limited vision who may need sailing information
        could not read it. That system causes harm. Is Mary justified in not
        fixing that system? And you&#8217;d just look at the Code of Ethics and
        say, &#8220;According to Principle 1.3, don&#8217;t cause harm. Here
        what it says. Mary should have done this or that, or made the system
        flexible so you can press a button and do certain kinds of things.&#8221; So
        that isn&#8217;t a particular example we used. I don&#8217;t remember
        the article, having been written 14 years ago. But it&#8217;s that kind
      of thing. </p>
      <p>It was very, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the code. Here&#8217;s the situation.
        Apply the code to the situation.&#8221; We know fully that that&#8217;s
        an over simplified version but at least it starts people out looking
        and seeing the relevance of the code. The point of this sidetrack that
        we&#8217;re on is Ron Anderson and his general ship knew what to do,
        and if you put paper out and you block moves ahead of time with paper
        and some form of publication, the moves appear silly. One of the things
        we&#8217;ll talk about later is some of the attempts I did with publications,
        which was learned from General Anderson. I guess he&#8217;d chuckle if
        I called him that but anyway, learned from Ron Anderson. But the other
        point is that I said to my department chair, &#8220;We have a critical
        issue with the ACM Code of Ethics. I need to go up to Boston. I need
        to not attend class on this day. We can cover it by such and such a faculty
        and I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; and there was not a &#8220;stay here&#8221;.
        I can tell you if I was at Wichita State and said that, that would not
        have been accepted because it was not really anything to do with computing.
        It was doing something that I liked doing. It would be like someone saying, &#8220;Well
        my strawberry crop is dying,&#8221; and asking not to teach their physics
        class so they could go and pick strawberries. The support and I&#8217;m
        going to stop this point. I could probably go on. It&#8217;s simply all
        of the pieces were supported by the department right up to the end and
        all of the crazy things I did. And it would not have happened, at least
        my participation in it would not have been there although someone else
        may have taken up the ball, but I would not have been in that picture.</p>

      <p><strong>Development of the Software Engineering Code</strong><a name="development"></a>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Just continuing on. We have Don Gotterbarn having set a foundation
        in philosophy and computing and software engineering, and then sort a
        spring board for his work in ethics at East Tennessee State. And so Don,
      go ahead and take the narrative from here.                        
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: While at East Tennessee State University in the early &#8216;90s,
        I think it was &#8217;91 or &#8217;92, I attended a meeting in Baltimore
        of the International Conference on Software Engineering. I&#8217;m not
        sure what my role was at the meeting, I&#8217;ve forgotten that, but
        I know I was involved in some discussions with some people about the
        potential for licensing software engineers. It had started to become
        an issue because Fletcher Buckley, a highly respected member of the IEEE,
        had distributed this document. And the document became a problem because
        prior to the meeting he would redistribute it about every two weeks,
        or three weeks with significant changes and modifications. So you never
        quite knew what he was going to present and he had visited with various
        groups at the conference. One group I belonged to was the Technical Committee
        on Software Engineering, an IEEE-Computer Society subgroup, and he had
        visited with us. </p>
      <p>And then sometime later during the conference, the Board of Governors
        of the IEEE met and had a meeting. Prior to the meeting there were some
        concerns of the Technical Committee on Software Engineering that there
        were confusions in Buckley&#8217;s document. Some of the things Buckley
        had suggested were good and we had thought out an alternate strategy.
        I believe Elliot Chikofsky was the architect of that strategy. I went
        to the board meeting the IEEE, which is according to IEEE standards open
        to anyone who wants to be there, but I was primarily in the mode of viewer
        and watcher of the proceedings that were going on. Buckley presented
        his suggestion and Buckley, being who he was, was respected and there
        was no significantly negative comment in that regard but some problems
        were pointed out. And the suggestion at that point was that a blue ribbon
        committee should be appointed to investigate the suggestions in Buckley&#8217;s
        proposal. Buckley&#8217;s proposal had some standards for licensing,
        had some standards for body of knowledge and what he had called registration
        which I believe is the way engineers get listed as professional engineers.
        The meeting went on without any acrimony and some names were picked out
        as great software engineers who would be on this committee, this blue
        ribbon panel that would review things. This blue ribbon panel later turned
        into what was the IEEE representative to the IEEE/ACM Steering Committee
        on the Professionalization of Software Engineering. I went home, reported
        some of those things to an ethics list that I had established. There
        were some varieties of negative comments on licensing and mis-setting
        standards. </p>
      <p>Then in the normal mode of events, a colleague that I had worked with
        at Wichita State University apprenticed the ethics elements in what I
        was doing and he was now teaching at Carnegie Mellon in the Software
        Engineering Institute, teaching their video project management course
        which is distributed world-wide. He would have me come down and do one
        video lecture on ethical issues in software project management that became
        part of his program.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Who was the colleague?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Jim Tomayko, the person I spoke about earlier at Wichita. And he
        also, I was also going down to make a CD. When I arrived, Jim had said
        something about Mario Barbacci, a name I was not familiar with but was
        later to find out he was a significant member of the IEEE and soon to
        become its president, was concerned about ethical issues in software
        engineering. And I immediately jumped at that and Jim said he had scheduled
        lunch with Mario. You have this discussion with Mario and you find out
        that Mario is now one of the people who was appointed to this blue ribbon
        committee from the meeting that had taken place in Baltimore. Mario describes
        to me a variety of things about the ethics standards that they are going
        to set to establish. I nodded and he asked if I would be interested,
        if I&#8217;m interested in doing that kind of thing. It wasn&#8217;t
        an overt offer to do particular anything, just an inquiry about my interest. </p>
      <p>I grabbed on to the opportunity and when I went back to Tennessee I
        wrote a three or four page letter about my stances on various things,
        about establishing ethical standards and standards within the IEEE. And
        out of that came an invitation to come to Pittsburgh and talk with Mario
        about this and whether I would be interested in working on the Ethics
        Committee. There was a meeting in Pittsburgh with Mario and a gentleman
        named Bob Melford, who I&#8217;d never heard of, who then chairman of
        the IEEE Professional Practice Committee. </p>
      <p>I was asked if I wanted to co-chair the Ethics Committee with Melford
        and help in to establish ethics standards for software engineering. Needless
        to say, my heart jumped at the opportunity and it took great control
        for me not to hug these people and say, &#8220;Thank you for the opportunity.&#8221; At
        that meeting, Melford and Barbacci who are familiar with the standards
        of the IEEE methods in establishing standards begin to talk. We begin
        to lay out a schedule. We begin to list some names of who would work
        on the teams with us. I listed names of people I knew like Joyce Currie
        Little, Keith Miller. Melford listed some names of people he knew. And
        the schedule was set up, and an approximate target date of November 1995
        was set up for the establishment of these ethics standards following
        the IEEE Standards Policy. That was the beginning of my participation
        as ACM co-chair of this committee. In some of our discussion and in experiences
        I&#8217;d had with the ACM and the ACM relations to the IEEE</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So let me speak clear. You were there in some way representing ACM?
        Or as an individual?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I was invited up as Don the individual and I was asked by Mario
        if I would be the ACM representative. </p>
      <p>I didn&#8217;t ask any of the political questions at that point. Political
        questions are very sensitive. I accepted the original schedule set up
        by Melford because I had no understanding of the policy of the IEEE That
        bit of ignorance became a problem that would permeate about three years
        of non-progress, accepting such a schedule. And it became a political
        football because people looked at the date and wondered what had happened
        or why things had gone wrong. </p>
      <p>Another problem in general for the early portion of the code, was I
        allowed myself to be in total dependence on Melford for identifying and
        controlling and directing the process. <br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And this is the IEEE Standards?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes, this is the IEEE Standards Development Process. It is a very
        convoluted process that normally takes five to seven years. It&#8217;s
        very political because every company in the world wants to be the IEEE
        standard because that puts them in business forever. I was there talking
        with the president, or soon to be president, of the IEEE and a person
        high up on the ladder, I thought, of the IEEE structure. </p>
      <p>We then went home and the first set of tasks was Melford&#8217;s. One,
        he was going to write up the minutes for the meeting. We were going to
        contact respected people on the list to see if they would be interested
        in doing this. He was going to write up a document that would determine
        the scope of our tasks, and he would also be writing up the standard
        form for a call to participation that we would broadcast widely. </p>
      <p>At various points in the early years Melford would say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s
        have a meeting,&#8221; and there would be a meeting of us at, for example,
        Washington D.C. at the IEEE, meeting at the IEEE, and it could be facilitated
        there because there was a conference going on that I would be attending
        and of course East Tennessee would pay for me to be there. At some of
        these meetings, strange things would go on that again you would have
        no understanding of. You had some volunteers there and in the middle
        of the table was a phone for a conference call, and new people who were
        on the upper echelons of the IEEE would be spoken to about establishing
        a PAR or establishing some other thing. And you had no idea; this was
        all IEEE jargon about the mechanics of doing things.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Can you explain PAR just for us? That a particular IEEE term.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: That&#8217;s a particular IEEE term whose meaning I&#8217;ve forgotten
        but it has to do with setting up the standard about the standard, or
        what the requirements will be for the standard. </p>
      <p>And so these kinds of things went on. You&#8217;d write some minutes.
        You&#8217;d say, &#8220;Well we&#8217;re going to get these and let&#8217;s
        get started.&#8221; We were to write up the standards of ethics for software
        engineering. This became a bit of a problem because when you appeared
        and spoke with the Blue Ribbon Committee and the minutes as written up
        by Melford as our meetings spoke about us as establishing something that
        had probably not been done before, called &#8220;Ethics Standards.&#8221; When
        you spoke with the Blue Ribbon Committee, ethics standards were things
        that would help a practitioner in a particular situation describe what
        they ought to morally do. That is the goal was to set of documents that
        said, &#8220;If you&#8217;re caught in a situation where someone says
        accept a bribe, don&#8217;t for the following reasons. If you&#8217;re
        in this situation and you need to do this technically, don&#8217;t for
        the following reasons.&#8221; And this was what most of the people on
        the committee had wanted. Other people would speak to you&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: The IEEE standards are technical standards. So in a certain way
        this was graphing on a process that was designed to deal with industry
        objectives and industry pressures onto a project that was entirely separate
        from setting up technical standard that commercial ramifications, and
        separate professional ramifications and consequences. But you were still
        following this overall IEEE Standards Process. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Following the IEEE model. Part of it is, part of the politics of
        this situation gets to be very confusing. The IEEE and the ACM historically
        work together when they have to. The IEEE is, tends to be interested
        in more applied things. The ACM used to be, at that point, more interested
        in theoretical and mathematical things. The ACM was worried about software
        engineering. That is, they had set up a committee wondering about whether
        software engineering was even a discipline at all and whether it should
        be included in computer science. When they became aware that the IEEE
        had set up a blue ribbon committee to professionalize software engineering,
        the ACM did what was the right, political thing for them to do and asked
        to be associated and an integral part of the project. That meant that
        your committee, your Blue Ribbon Committee, was enlarged and included
        IEEE appointees and ACM appointees. One of the issues about politics
        of volunteer organizations and appointees to blue ribbon committees is
        you pick those people who have the biggest names and the most influence
        to be on a blue ribbon committee. But by the nature of them having the
        biggest names and the most influence, they&#8217;re also incredibly busy
        and the amount of time they can devote to volunteering or working on
        the committee and following its detail is minimized. Some of the interesting
        things that that have found out years afterward, is that when you approach
        some of these people on the committee to ask about their work on it,
        they have no recollection of the existence of the committee.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Beneath their notice in a certain way.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Or they will deny specific things for which we have emails. The
        other problem is appointees to a committee are like any committee, it&#8217;s
        loaded. And there are people who will express particular points of view.
        So, on this committee were ACM members who were clearly opposed to software
        engineering as a profession. On this committee were people who were clearly
        in favor of the ethics being set up as absolute standards conforming
        to IEEE guidelines. Against this, quietly, one or two when talking about
        ethics would say the word &#8220;code of ethics&#8221;. At the meetings
        I attended of this committee it was expressly said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t
        want another code of ethics.&#8221; This confusing of requirement and
        what was desired added a layer of difficultly to the progress in the
        early years. The layer of difficultly was trying to build something that
        was not clearly defined, and build something that had no prototype out
        there that you could easily copy. That led to...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: May I ask? The ACM Code of Ethics that you had worked on earlier
        was across the ACM but not specifically focused on software engineering
        as a domain. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: That&#8217;s right.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So it was across the board.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Teachers, mathematicians, anybody. It was across the board.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So the particular problem wasn&#8217;t a code of ethics but a code
        of ethics in this particular domain, oscillating between the IEEE and
        the ACM?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: You heard from both IEEE and ACM, &#8220;What do we need another
        code of ethics for?&#8221; They each had their code of ethics, why do
        we need another code of ethics, which was one of the issues causing trouble. </p>
      <p>There was a second underlying issue in the politics, which had to do
        with the licensing of software engineers. The licensing of software engineers
        had at that... Part of the reason, I believe, for the acceptance of the
        work of this committee, or for the acceptance that this committee should
        work at this point, was that there was in at least one legislative bill
        before the state of New Jersey a discussion about whether to license
        software engineers. There was a discussion in several other legislatures
        thinking about whether they should have a similar bill. So the issue
        about licensing was coming forward. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And Fletcher Buckley had raised that within...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Fletcher Buckley had presented that as a suggestion that we should
        support in the IEEE. But what was happening was that there were external
        pressures outside of the profession saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s establish
        standards.&#8221; The model for establishing standards that was written
        in New Jersey was sharply criticized by many in the software engineering
        professions as misdirected, misplaced. It wasn&#8217;t that they were
        against licensing; it was that this was a terrible document. So one of
        the underlying motivations was, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have licensing.&#8221; That
        was an attitude that, I think, several people in the IEEE had. The ACM
        on the other hand was opposed to this, because if you have licensing
        you will create engineering school, computer science. And many of the
        ACM, many computer science programs were in liberal arts schools and
        would not be able to be, would not produce licensable people. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: ABET accreditation, the whole...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: ABET accreditation and that whole infrastructure is very volatile.
        So just the general underlying issue. Even today there is an ex-president
        of the ACM who opposes the Software Engineering Code of Ethics who thinks
        its existence would facilitate licensing. </p>
      <p>Now you have this political structure where people come together sometimes
        through conference call and so on. You have three taskforces; one to
        establish ethical standards, one to establish a body of knowledge, and
        one to establish education, which are ex-officio members of this committee. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Let me just see if I get that right. Three taskforces on ethical
        standards, the body of knowledge, and a separate one for education?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>DG</strong>: There&#8217;s a taskforce on ethical standards. There&#8217;s a separate
        taskforce on defining the body of knowledge of software engineering,
        so that people won&#8217;t be able to say it&#8217;s immature anymore.
        There&#8217;s another taskforce on defining the education and what a
        software engineering curriculum would look like. </p>
      <p>The process that was going on was a little bit problematic in the way
        I had allowed myself to participate. Dependency on Bob Melford and his
        delivering products was a mistake. I understood the politics of ACM and
        IEEE and every taskforce had co-chairs to kind of check against one another.
        Melford I had met on several occasions would come up with suggestions
        and many of them he would volunteer to undertake. We would inform the
        committee that something that various people who were with us on these
        taskforces, that this would take place but things would not happen. There
        was a general consistent problem of communication on my part with get
        communication back from Malfred. And then I would feel guilty and send
        letters to the working members of our organization at that point and
        try to encourage them to stay with it, something will be coming soon.
        Sometimes that &#8220;soon&#8221; was a matter of six months or eight
        months. </p>
      <p>I&#8217;ve left out an important step in the organization. After the
        initial meeting, we had these lists of people, Miller, Little, Weisband,
        Patrick Sullivan and so on that we put together at this initial meeting
        in the Software Engineering Institute. We contacted each of them individually
        and asked them if they would like to work with us on this project. The
        names we picked were people who happened to be interested in ethics that
        we knew. So the positive response was accepted. In organizing this process,
        what we did was to have meetings where there were conferences. So in
        1994, there was a conference in Boston for the National Education Computer
        Conference, NECC. Miller, Little, Gotterbarn, Melford, and McFarland
        were all in Boston. So we met at Boston College and laid out a plan.
        The plan in part was again addressing unclear requirements. So the attack
        we took was, &#8220;Let&#8217;s divide the standards into sections. Let&#8217;s
        divide them into sections that are technical and ethical.&#8221; So we
        had a section on security. We had a section on privacy. We had a section
        on intellectual property. We divided the world into eight sections. The
        list I don&#8217;t remember at the moment. At that moment in this planning
        session at Boston College, we took volunteers from people who were at
        the meeting to head what would be a working group, to write a short definition
        of what their working group standard would be about, and then to be in
        charge of running the working group.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: One working group for each of these...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: One working group for each...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Security, privacy, intellectual property, and so on.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Each of these was to conform separately to a standard that we would
        establish as an ethical standard on such and such. The one that I chaired
        was called &#8220;Professional Competence&#8221;. And one of the things
        following IEEE procedures, each working group leader would be in charge
        of people who had volunteered for their working group. The meeting...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: This is setting up a large number of people being involved. Eight
        working groups, each working group having a group of volunteers. This
        is a large cast of characters.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Right.<br>
        The minutes for this meeting were typed up and are part of the record.
          The idea was that then you would have a call for participation that
          you would set up, sent out conforming to IEEE standards. The call for
          participation would announce the structure for our ethics taskforce.
          The structure for our ethics taskforce was Melford and Gotterbarn as
          co-chairs and then the leaders of the eight working groups. That was
          the overall structure and people were invited in the call for participation
          to volunteer for, to participate in any or all of the working groups.
      That was the political super structure. </p>
      <p>One of the things that happened was this call for participation, although
        not finished and approved, got out some how at various stages and different
        times, and some people were volunteering for things even though the structure
        hadn&#8217;t been set up. The call for participation went out several
        months later. There was just a quite time when volunteers are saying, &#8220;Hey
        Don. What&#8217;s happening? Why didn&#8217;t you do this?&#8221; And
        I would send an email to Melford and sometimes get a response and sometimes
        not. </p>
      <p>He wrote the call for participation. It went out, and we had a set of
        volunteers set out for the various working groups. I took the list of
        volunteers and distributed those volunteers by email, information on
        them to the various working group leaders, charging each working group
        to set up a mailing list, to begin work, to contact their members, to
        talk about how to set up a standard. </p>
      <p>For many working group leaders there was not any follow on activity.
        I had tried, let&#8217;s see... I tried several times to get some follow
        on work or to proceed to do some stuff. Sending to my working group a
        list of, requesting of them that they look at codes of ethics and others
        standards, any standards they can find, for standards of professional
        competence. </p>
      <p>In the middle of this process, IIT got a grant to do some research on
        this process. Michael Davis sent me an email asking if he and Vivian
        Weil could watch what was going on in this development. I sent my group
        that letter and said, &#8220;Do any of you having any objections to us
        being part of their research?&#8221; I got no negative responses. So
        I added them at their current email addresses to my mailing list. </p>
      <p>Now in this point in technology one of the things that happens is you
        get over confidence in the technology or you believe things are simpler
        than they appear. The type of mailing list at this point was something
        called a list serve. We had no list serve at my university but I had
        a friend at the University of Tennessee who got her university computing
        folk to set up a list serve for me with all of the emails as I had sent
        on to them. Now one of the things that happened is I, as other people
        on my committee, believe technology works without checking it at every
        moment. So I would send letters to the list serve believing that people
        got the messages. The list serve would only accept letters from people
        whose email corresponded to the membership of the list serve. So when
        IIT changed servers, or for some other reason, Weil or Davis&#8217;s
        addresses changed then they would not get any email about the process. </p>
      <p>This led to one of the more interesting episodes in the development
        of the code. One of the people in my working group that was to establish
        ethical standards of professional competence was like many of the volunteers
        who stayed with it, wonderful and energetic and committed. Sometimes
        that commitment leads you to do things that aren&#8217;t consistent with
        what goes on or leads to strange results. Edward Melcher who was a licensed
        engineer and working in Pittsburgh had been on the professional competence
        committee. They company changed his email. He received no more emails
        from me because his email address did not match the list&#8217;s address
        for him. He was unaware of this but indignant that I was not emailing
        him. And he had a list of the people, other people&#8217;s emails from
        the list serve from when it did connect with him. So he sent to several
        of them, about six of them, saying &#8220;Is the Professional Competence
        group still in existence? I haven&#8217;t heard from Don Gotterbarn in
        so many months.&#8221; And they responded back some of them having heard
        from me, some of them not. All of them choosing to blame the human being
        for impoliteness or whatever because he was not keeping in contact with
        them. <br>
        The episodes with Melcher who was a significant contributor to this whole
        process, another one of those people who I would probably say this would
        not have gotten done had it not been for him, is that he changed jobs
        a few times, changed emails a few times, and contact with him throughout
        the whole process was always amazingly difficult. Contact worked through
        his sending to his own list of a small group of people. At this time
        mind you, you had eight working groups, six of them having done nothing.
        Six of them, not being inspired very much because of delays in learning
        the scope and procedures of standards and so on and having their operations
        not clearly defined. </p>
      <p>There was during this an event that occurred in, &#8217;95 national
        meeting... There were some higher level steering committee political
        difficulties that we as ex-officio members had no idea of things going
        on. Some of these items had to do with the other two taskforces. In &#8217;95
        for example, I was at a meeting in Nashville where the Steering Committee
        came to have its meeting, but ex-officio were excluded. Only paper reports
        from the committees, from the three committees were allowed. And they
        discussed issues with the other items and you knew there was some difficulty
        because you weren&#8217;t even included in the discussion. Although you
        met with Mario Barbacci who was now, I think at that point, heading this
        group. And Mario in private conversation said he wanted the ethics to
        succeed and was very strongly in favor of it. So you knew you had some
        political strength. The ACM member, Dennis Frailey, was a primarily support
        of the ethics process through out the whole thing. In fact most of my
        communications to the Steering Committee were not responded to unless
        they were responded to by Dennis Frailey. Melcher...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Just a second, if I could ask you to reflect on this at the moment.
        It is the difficulties that are going on you might say that it was adopting
        the wrong model, an IEEE Standards model, for something that was different.
        Alternately you could say that is was the wrong type of people, or the
        wrong type of number of people regardless of the structure for, I&#8217;m
        just sort of curious, the six out of eight working groups didn&#8217;t
        sort of catalyze. They weren&#8217;t energetic. They didn&#8217;t do
        the things that they hoped to. Was that a failure of individual leaders
        just to take up and to organize those six different working groups or
        do you have a diagnosis about sort of how this, sort of, inactive time
        went?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I have a diagnosis about the inactive time but I&#8217;m about to
        respond in a way that is just like the response that you worry about
        when you make documents public. We had, in Pittsburgh at that first meeting,
        named the people we wanted to talk to. Some people when you ask them
        to do something will say yes and they get their names in lots of places.
        But they are distracted by other things or there are people in the world
        who dream wonderful dreams and don&#8217;t know how to follow through
        on them. We have the people who were interested in the subject but were
        not what I call &#8220;closure people&#8221;. That is the follow through
        on tough stuff leads to, or is caused by numerous distractions. I know
        that one of them their spouse got sick. Other ones you just never heard
        from again. But now you have this publicly identified group, some who
        were IEEE, some who were ACM representatives, and to do anything to upset
        the balance are the kinds of things that are quite difficult. <br>
      </p>
      <p>*ACM Meeting of 1996<br>
        Let me give you an example of one of the items that went on. Early as
          our committee was established as Melford was to be writing the various
          IEEE standard boiler plate things, we attended a meeting, or I attended
          a meeting in Pittsburgh which was open to the ex-officio members of
          the Steering Committee. And gave a creative progress report that we
          had decided on eight groups and done this kind of thing, and did not
      say a whole lot about the non-progress of the groups and so on. </p>
      <p>Part
          of the thing that was going on at that meeting was one of Melford&#8217;s
        acquaintances in Washington was setting up a special computer issues
        meeting with the House of Representatives. Where we were, they were going
        to talk about and present to the House of Representative the various
        kinds of ethical issues and issues with computing. And I think the person&#8217;s
        name was Peter Tipea or Tripit who was responsible for organizing this,
        and he was the one who contacted Melford. Melford told me and told the
        Steering Committee that we had been requested to do a congressional briefing
        on the development of ethical standards for software engineering. A press
        release was written for that, drafted. At the meeting I attended the
        press release was presented to the Steering Committee. Now you&#8217;re
        talking about people who are on the Steering Committee who are the blue
        ribbon folks, who are the top. Well the memo started, &#8220;The IEEE
        Computer Society, 100,000 members strong and the ACM 85,000 members strong
        have joined together to establish the professionalization of software
        engineering,&#8221; baboom, baboom, baboom. &#8220;And are going to do
        this congressional briefing.&#8221; It took ten minutes to get past the
        first sentence because the ACM people did not like the fact that their
        membership was listed at 85,000 whereas the [IEEE] membership was listed
        at 100,000. The ACM representatives wanted the memo to say, &#8220;The
        joint committee, the ACM and IEEE, representing 185,000 computer folks,&#8221; covering
        the discrepancy, and the memo, the analysis of the memo went on like
      that. This is just a simple example to give you the idea of&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: The prickly nature of the&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes, very, very sensitive. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Just by the way you&#8217;ve been saying IEEE, in 95% of the cases
      you don&#8217;t mean the IEEE at large but the IEEE CS.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes, that&#8217;s correct. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: That&#8217;s fine. IEEE&#8217;s fine.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: This was on of the political nightmares because you knew of the
        most recent debate, which had been which of the two was the older computer
        society. And the IEEE had come up with some evidence, which they believed
        made them one month older than the ACM and so they were advocating this.
        And the ACM then in response simply changed the name of the ACM to ACM:
        The First Society in Computing, &#8220;first&#8221; meaning premier.
        That gives you&#8230;you have to know&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So there&#8217;s a lot of tensions and turf&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And you have to sit there and watch all of this and every move has
        to both move forward and not upset enough of the opposition so that they
        raise issues to stop the forward motion.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: This is we would say contested terrain. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes. So we&#8217;ve done the Nashville meeting&#8230; Ah! Then comes&#8230; we&#8217;re
        up to Maltcher. Maltcher having done&#8230; Melcher having started gathering
        the stuff together, Ed sent me an email and said, &#8220;Would you mind
        I have this sub group ready to do things and if I led them in gathering
        this stuff?&#8221; And I was pleased that anyone was working so of course
        I said yes and encouraged him. Then there was silence. I presumed Melcher
        changed jobs again. Communications with Melcher ceased. </p>
      <p>On a totally separate thread, Melcher&#8217;s group had put together,
        as I had requested initially and Melcher encouraged them to do the same
        thing, a list of ethical kinds of approaches to things; requirements,
        imperatives. And Melcher had to his group suggested a preliminary draft
        of this, of how this would be put together as a code of ethics. Now this
        is one of the other interesting left turns that the process takes. The
        initial tasking was standard, standard, standards on a code of ethics.
        From what we&#8217;ve said before, you know about me that when you say
        standards to me I tie that intimately with ethics. So underlying a heart-of-hearts
        is, &#8220;Yes, if we can get a code of ethics out of this we&#8217;re
        really going to win.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>[end of tape 2 side B]</strong><br>
        <br>
        Okay, so Melcher is doing a job of getting this material together and
        gathering information as was requested and as he produced the same tactics
        and is trying to get a structure to it. At the same time there is little
        response in the needed items from Melford and now we&#8217;re turning
        a corner and we&#8217;re into 1996 from 1994. In February of 1996 in
        Philadelphia, the Association for Computing Machinery had one of their
        standard meetings. So we called a meeting of our ethics taskforce. At
        the ethics taskforce meeting, Miller, Joyce Currie Little, myself, and
        Bob Melford appeared. Interesting things went on at that meeting. The
        first thing was Bob Melford did not come to our taskforce meeting but
        saw me and was mumbling funny things to me about he didn&#8217;t know
        if he could be involved anymore. Without any kind of explanation, very
        cryptic statements and you thought he was mentioning some things which
        indicated the IEEE might have some disapproval of his action. We&#8217;ll
      leave it there. </p>
      <p>Also at the meeting Dennis Frailey came up to me before our taskforce
        meeting and said the ACM is considering dropping their support. I had
        at the moment read him as giving me a personal message saying they were
        not going to support the ethics project any longer. He said I needed
        to produce some deliverable, like a schedule and a plan, and it had to
        be given to him to present to the ACM committee. Frailey was continuing
        his role as inside supporter of the ethics project as ACM representative.
        Later, I now believe, that it was more significant than I had interpreted
        it as being, because the ACM, a few years later, totally backed out of
        its support of the project on all grounds and no longer participated
        in it. </p>
      <p>Frailey&#8217;s message to me was that I had to put together a schedule.
        At the meeting of the taskforce in Philadelphia we then put together
        a schedule. Again, overly optimistic. Let&#8217;s get the taskforce leaders
        working. Let&#8217;s get the information input from them. And Keith Miller
        volunteered to use a portion of his summer to write out the standards
        documents that we would produce and put them into a consistent and eloquent
        form. Because he was giving up his summer, which would normally involve
        some income, we were going to ask the Steering Committee for financial
        support for the scribe. The meeting ended with an agenda, the schedule
        set up, and my task to request information and funding from the Steering
        Committee. </p>
      <p>The request went to the Steering Committee. The request went to all
        of the working groups. The results were no response from the Steering
        Committee so no financial support for Miller. Miller&#8217;s group and
        the Professional Competence group were the only two that ended up doing
        anything. Going through the year, those people who were not in Mechler&#8217;s
        group would respond to me saying, &#8220;What is going on?&#8221; And
        we couldn&#8217;t get the work forwarded because I had no approval from
        my co-chair who was now totally out of contact. I sent several messages
        to the co-chair; his office, his home, left voice mails listing the things
        that had failed so far and not been done. And told him I was going to
        go ahead and work with my Professional Competence group if he didn&#8217;t
        have any objections. </p>
      <p>This is a strategy I strongly recommend. To get things done, you don&#8217;t
        wait for approval. You work out what you think is right. You do it. And
        when someone comes back and says, &#8220;Shame on you,&#8221; you go, &#8220;Opps.&#8221; But
        you&#8217;ve gotten the job done. One of the ways of doing it is to consider
        non-response as approval. With Melford, although the structure of the
        committee was I needed response from the, support from the IEEE side
        before I could do anything as a co-chair, I simply said, &#8220;If you
        do not respond, I&#8217;m going to do it.&#8221; I had reached a significant
        level of irritation at being the goat, the person who said we&#8217;re
        going to do x, y, and z and then nothing happened because I didn&#8217;t
        have significant support. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: But you now took Melford&#8217;s lack of communication as a lack
        of obstruction and moved forward?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: No, I forced that position. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going ahead,&#8221; and
        given the fact that he had not responded to anything I could reasonably
        expect that he was not going to respond to this. I have still to this
        day not a clear understanding of what went on and so forth. I know from
        discussions with one of the presidents of the IEEE that there was some
        problem with his leading the professional practice organization but I
        don&#8217;t know what those problems were. </p>
      <p>So I started to go forward. And again progress was slow. We&#8217;re
        in the middle to the end of 1996 when I&#8217;m worried about going on
        a sabbatical. Six months of which are going to be spent in Washington
        D.C. and the next six months spent in England. While this is going on,
        [Mechler] has contacted Michael Davis who was doing this research on
        the project, and convinced Michael Davis to draft these documents into
        a code. Again this is one of those interesting notes that a code is not
        what was asked for but a set of standards was asked for. Davis wrote
        the code and I believe it circled a few times in the Mechler group. Mechler
        sent the code to the new head of the IEEE-ACM Steering Committee.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: I&#8217;m sorry. Did I have Melford asking Michael or Mechler asking
        Michel?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Mechler, I&#8217;m sorry. This is going to be a problem. I&#8217;m
        going to transfer the word to Ed. So we&#8217;ll talk about Bob as Melford
        and Ed as Mechler. So Ed asked Michael Davis to write the code. Michael
        did write the code and it got circulated into the sub group of the professional
        competence sub group led by Ed. Ed, thinking I was out of the loop and
        not corresponding with him and unwilling to do so, I having gotten no
        emails from him because he couldn&#8217;t respond to the professional
        competence group, sent the code as if it was a final document to the
        then named head of the Steering Committee as the contribution from the
        ethics taskforce. Philippe Cabrerra had been appointed head of the Steering
        Committee. Philippe Cabrerra was working for Microsoft on an absolutely
        major project, which took all of his time. Philippe had little understanding
        of the politics inside of the Steering Committee and when sent things
        by Ed, Cabrerra responded as a gracious leader and said things like, &#8220;Thank
        you for working. We appreciate it,&#8221; and so on. Philippe then circulated
        this draft to the members of the Steering Committee. Given all of the
        structure that I said before, you can image the difficulty that that
        created. Those that didn&#8217;t want a code of ethics objected. Those
        who feared standardization objected. Both sides objected in a variety
        of ways. </p>
      <p>And I received an&#8230; And at this meeting one other event occurred,
        probably the most significant from my perspective. Bob Melford who travels
        a lot to conferences was in Pittsburgh at a conference. Bob heard that
        the Steering Committee was meeting and no ex-officio members invited.
        It was a closed meeting. Philippe Cabrerra didn&#8217;t understand the
        reasoning for this. Melford appeared at the meeting and sat down, and
        Philippe invited him in conversations.</p>
      <p>It was reported to me afterward that Melford declared that he was totally
        aware of Mechler&#8217;s code of ethics; again I must repeat that this
        was a thing done among a closed group Davis, Ed, and a group of his people,
        and Bob having been out of contact for almost a year had no idea about
        what was going on. At this point they gave a series of charges about
        the code of ethics to Bob. Bob said yes he would get it done and took
        some gracious thanks for his efforts on the code of ethics and things
        he did. </p>
      <p>I got a call from Dennis Frailey while I was now living in Leesburg,
        Virginia on my Washington sabbatical and I can remember that call and
        where I was quite vividly. It occurred in the evening while I was down
        in the basement working on my computer and the phone rang and it was
        Dennis, and he asked me, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on with this code?&#8221; And
        I said, &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; And he told me about Melford
        accepting that he would do x, y, and z and Don and Bob would take care
        of it, and I exploded. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived for three years
        like this and I will not do it any more. I&#8217;m about to resign this
        committee. Nothing has been done and I can&#8217;t have my name dragged
        about like this.&#8221; I will confess to being an egotist. I don&#8217;t
        like my name in the mud. And being accused of not working and being responsible
        for all of the slow down offended me. Now I hear that, I&#8217;m going
        to say this carefully. I was upset by the description. It was reported
        to me that Cabrerra let Melford speak because he didn&#8217;t know Bob&#8217;s
        pervious history and what was going on. That Cabrerra was still primarily
        a busy person who had very little time to do this. </p>
      <p>That evening I composed a letter to Frailey and Cabrerra saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
        delivered projects before. I&#8217;ve delivered them on time. This project
        has been at an absolute stand still because you have a monster with two
        heads. Monsters with two heads starve to death. I will pull out of this
        or I will take over. If I take over you will get a product. What would
        you like to do?&#8221;</p>
      <p>I received information back that I was to be put on as the head of the
        committee and to do whatever I thought necessary to make things work.
        A formal email got written by Cabrerra stating that and in a general
        way stating that for a variety of reasons people are unable to work on
        a project, Gotterbarn will be in charge. I found out years later when
        Davis was writing this book that apparently Melford resigned. I&#8217;m
        not sure when that happened, whether he resigned right after he said
        he would do all these tasks or how that worked. I have no idea of the
        politics. What I know is that I was put in charge. And I though, &#8220;Now
        we can go ahead and do things,&#8221; and I proceed with my side of the
        story. <br>
        The first thing I did while in Washington was to restructure what had
        been going on but very concerned about the politics. So what I did was
        to take my professional competence mailing list, which was a handy tool.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And you&#8217;re restructuring not your working group but the whole
        committee structure?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I am now the lead of the taskforce. That is correct. The restructuring
        is done politically so that I can eliminate or throw off heads of working
        groups that may not have been doing any thing. I have a list called Professional
        Competence that has nothing to do with that working group anymore; it&#8217;s
        going to be a tool I will use to structure everything that follows. I
        send to the leaders of the working group an email that says I&#8217;m
        put in charge. I tell them that they will receive letters from the list
        serve in Tennessee. Now remember I&#8217;m now in Leesburg, Virginia
        trying to get a Tennessee list serve fixed that&#8217;s being done sort
        of surreptitiously at the University of Tennessee because they&#8217;re
        doing it&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Not your home university.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Right, I mean this is&#8230; This complication continues through.
        So people think&#8230; Of course the Davis, Weil emails are changing
        and they&#8217;re wondering why they&#8217;re getting stuff or not getting
        stuff. What then happens is to keep things politically correct I email
        each leader of the working group. All but Miller&#8217;s had done nothing.
        I&#8217;m sorry, the professional competence group and Miller&#8217;s
        group are the only groups that had worked. And say to the leaders, &#8220;I&#8217;m
        adding you to this list. Please take the role of communicating with any
        of your volunteers that have worked.&#8221; My belief at that moment
        is that none of them have ever contacted their volunteers, but I need
        to keep this people on board to keep the IEEE/ACM balance for political
        reasons. So that&#8217;s the politics of the situation.</p>
      <p>I also know when I am going to England within a few weeks to meet with
        Simon Rogerson who I had met on other occasions and who has the characteristics
        that are necessary to make a project, a volunteer project complete.</p>
      <p>Is that going out of ink? Oh, okay. </p>
      <p>The characteristics are that when you say you will do something, one
        you mean it, you take honor in that claim, and you work in negative time
        if necessary to get it done. So the primary move I then made was to take
        what I had evidence of what my working group had done at that moment,
        which was the people in Mechler&#8217;s group, in Ed&#8217;s group, Keith
        Miller and whoever he brought along, and Simon Rogerson and know that
        these people were going to be the workers on the named taskforce. And
        there&#8217;s a difference between the named taskforce and the worker
        bees. Then what I did even further&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And the named taskforce above all else means needs to preserve this
        IEEE/ACM balance.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: This was my belief. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Nonetheless you also need to get work done so you need to find people
        who are capable and active with that. And you can to some extent not
        worry so much&#8230;</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I can complete a project if I pick the right people. The people
        who want to work and are committed will do that job, and many of them
        who were on Ed&#8217;s original group who carried through to the end.
        There were some people who appeared now and then out of the woodwork
        who were amazing, who did wonderful things in the project. And you keep
        saying, &#8220;How is this happening?&#8221; and it continued to go on. </p>
      <p>So what I did was to use a name to legitimize closer control over the
        project. So I invented something called an &#8220;executive committee.&#8221; And
        to legitimize that politically I wrote a story, I&#8217;ve got to say
        this better. To make this politically correct as to the makeup of the
        executive committee, the executive committee being Gotterbarn, Miller,
        and Rogerson, I clearly labeled them as Rogerson as a member of the ACM,
        Miller as a member of the IEEE Computer Society, Gotterbarn as a member
        of both societies. We represent the societies then equally. Miller is
        a practicing, was a practicing software engineer and he also not only
        a college professor, but he&#8217;s built systems in the US. The international
        prospective that&#8217;s desired is represented by Rogerson. So this
        is what I sent in as my structure for the committee. <br>
        Then came a surprise that is, depending on your interpretation, indicates
        a belief that I could get things done or were hurdles thrown in front
        of me. What was asked to be delivered by February 12 were three documents;
        one being the an explanation of the architecture of the code, one being
        an explanation of the functions of a codes of ethics, and the other being
        a justification that this was an engineering code and what were the specific
        engineering elements. Three documents, I&#8217;m arriving in England,
        and in less than two or three weeks these things had to be delivered
        as final documents. All sorts of things take place now.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Just a second. Those, the three documents on architecture, functions,
        and justification are being delivered to?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: The Steering Committee.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Steering Committee. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: One of the presumptions is that they&#8217;d all actually read them.
        There was a negative tone in there I hope you detected. You were doing
        this, I believed, as an exercise. So part of my goal was to fulfill the
        exercise. Davis, in his book about this project, complained that these
        documents did not represent extended doctoral scholarship about this,
        but that was clearly a charge based on a mistake that function that was
        intended. </p>
      <p>At this point all sorts of wonderful things go on, but all sorts of
        things that are indicative of problems that we had originally and continued.
        In the printing of the table I had, people who were on my Professional
        Competence Committee contributed, Mechler&#8217;s committee contributed,
        Miller contributed, Rogerson contributed. We had a PH.D. student who
        was working at the center there with us. We put him on grunt work looking
        at code and putting things together. The table got developed and distributed
        to the committee. </p>
      <p>I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ve got to say this clearly now. I have a policy.
        I tend to hold opinions very strongly and assert them. Sometimes I can
        be dead wrong, knowing that I can make mistakes, I always take the safe
        road and say, &#8220;What do you think? What do you think? What do you
        think?&#8221; And send it out to whomever I trust. I now had a group;
        Mechler&#8217;s group, the executive committee, what was left of Miller&#8217;s
        group that I could trust. So this thing went out to these groups. And
        of course the email nightmares begin, because Mechler was unable to print
        this particular document. And a back and forth exchange started. And
        it was a little bit embarrassing because Mechler didn&#8217;t understand
        a basic thing about the emails and about the kind of font you would print
        the table in. So he had used relative font which changes sizes depending
        on which letter you use. So the table never came out right. And we were
        all, all of us on the committee now wondering, I&#8217;ll have to speak
        carefully, on the ethics taskforce trying to speculate as to what the
        problem was, because we did not understand that he did not know this
        basic truth. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: To do a code is to do it in Courier. So it&#8217;s standard.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Right, you set it in Courier. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So a &#8220;w&#8221; takes up the same width so all the columns
        stay lined up. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: You know this basic truth but this one great person who contributed
        to the code didn&#8217;t. Although he&#8217;s working as a software developer
        in various companies in Pennsylvania. And we spent days fooling around
        until one of them said, &#8220;Maybe Ed doesn&#8217;t know this.&#8221; And
        we looked at each other going, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding.&#8221; And
        it got sent out. Now those are silly kinds of things that go on but now
        the process of the code is underway. </p>
      <p>One of the other things I sent out was a schedule to the steering committee
        using the very same method I used with Melford, with Bob. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Dear Steering Committee,<br>
        Here is a very tight schedule. We&#8217;ll finish things by December.
        Here are the things we want to do. Here&#8217;s what we need from you.
        If you delay, you will delay the project. We need a budget to put up
        a web page to exchange things. We need to,&#8221; now the publicity standard
        comes in, &#8220;if I do things publicly you can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m
        not doing things and it&#8217;s tough to deny. We want to print the article.
        Here are the versions of the code here, there, and else where.&#8221;</p>
      <p>And you lay out the schedule that has the versions of the code going
        through various test phases and so on. You sit on this for a little bit
        because you&#8217;re not hearing from the Steering Committee and you
        can&#8217;t let out the schedule publicly because you don&#8217;t have
        funding from the Steering Committee, and one of your elements involved
        funding. Consistent with what went on before, no response, no funding,
        but I smiled because the letter had said, &#8220;This is what we&#8217;re
        going to do. If you don&#8217;t like it, object.&#8221; And there was
        no objection, which meant I took it as license to move forward, and that&#8217;s
        what I did. </p>
      <p>So the code of ethics then started to go into version 2, and you started
        to encounter some of the interesting things with English English and
        American English. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Just checking. You&#8217;re now doing this work...?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I&#8217;m sitting in England.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: In England.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I&#8217;m sitting in England at Simon Rogerson&#8217;s university.
        In a very small office this one element becomes a really interesting
        positive. Which was really an ugly place; it was what had been a storage
        area next to a staircase. Had no communications with the outside world,
        most people didn&#8217;t even know I was there. This worked out to be
        wonderful because Rogerson would come into my office, we&#8217;d shut
        the door, and neither he nor I would have distractions. We&#8217;d get
        comments from people... We had enlarged the taskforce by inviting some
        people in England and some people in his university to participate in
        this as well. One of the things... And Keith Miller in the US is one
        of those people who he&#8217;d get an email and you&#8217;d get a response
        back in two hours. That was the way he operates always and to this day
        he does. And so we would get suggestions coming back and Rogerson would
        come into my office. And we would start to go through the suggestions
        and we would start to put this thing together in a list in so on, send
        it off to Miller, &#8220;What do you think? We think this. What do you
        think that? We think this.&#8221; And it would come back. One of the
        early decisions that was important was this code is going to be in American
        English.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Not in British English.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Not in British English, and then you have spellings with &#8220;honor&#8221; and &#8220;favor&#8221; and
        all this kind of stuff and you just avoided it. And that became a model
        for &#8220;The Code&#8221;. Everybody was invited...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: May I ask, were there significant intellectual inputs? In other
        words, did certain aspects of the code change either their intentions,
        or aspirations, or consequences from you&#8217;re being in England at
        the time? You have people from Rogerson&#8217;s university working in
        your group but can you reflect a bit and say, &#8220;Well the code is
        different because we have British people working along side what was
        otherwise an American group.&#8221; </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: No, and what is interesting about the ultimate progress of the code
        is that a certain theory I have seems to have some support. My theory
        is that a software professional no matter where they are in the world
        tests their software, writes good documentation, makes it maintainable,
        builds it the best they can. This code... Mechler&#8217;s committee had
        an Egyptian on it. My final committee, the final taskforce had El-Kaldi,
        the Egyptian on it. We had people from Australia on it. We had people
        from all over the world. </p>
      <p>When the code was finished, I received a copy of it from Croatia where
        people had translated it into Croatian and published it on their website
        for software developers in Croatia to follow. Shortly there after, I
        received one from Shanghai where the Shanghai Computer Society had adopted
        this code for them to follow and it was a Chinese translation of it.
        I received three requests from Spanish speaking countries, Spain, Argentina,
        and Mexico, for a Spanish translation. And I did my typical thing of, &#8220;Okay,
        you guys want to do it, I give you the honor of writing the first draft
        of the Spanish translation.&#8221; And we have a Spanish translation. </p>
      <p>And you start to get this and you go, &#8220;The code...&#8221; People
        have argued who tried to do an international code dictatorially by one
        nation writing it and spreading it failed. And they write all sorts of
        stories about why you can never have an internationally adopted code.
        The Australian Computer Society has just adopted the Software Engineering
        Code and made it a standard of practice for the engineers in Australia,
        not just the Computer Society members. And it goes on. </p>
      <p>To point out particular ones, there were styles of doing things that
        were not particular items in code. The Europeans took more of what&#8217;s
        called a virtue ethics approach. This is, lay it out and trust on the
        person to be a good person, to here&#8217;s the standards and you follow
        them as best you can. The Americans took a rights obligation; state it
        as a fact, mark it down type of approach. That was the discernable difference
        from nationalities. In [the]whole process of doing this there was little
        about issues with, that you could identify with country-wise. The use
        of the word &#8220;assure&#8221; and &#8220;insure&#8221; caused some,
        I&#8217;ll say some silly grammatical discussions back and forth. </p>
      <p>I have to go back one step when I talked about Bob sending the thing
        to the steering... I&#8217;m sorry. I have to go back one step when I
        talked about Ed sending the first draft of the code to Philippe Cabrerra
        and so on. One of the things that happened...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You&#8217;re returning to your narrative.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes, I&#8217;m returning to my narrative of that time. I believe
        it almost killed the code. The reaction from the steering committee is, &#8220;Unacceptable,
        unacceptable, unacceptable. Justify this.&#8221; Now they only had two
        people writing out comments but this was the representation from the
        Steering Committee. So some people... It&#8217;s assumed that only two
        people on the Steering Committee objected to what was going on because
        only two people wrote about it. That was a mistake. There was in the
        conversations with me on the phone it was, &#8220;This is going to die.
        There is this problem.&#8221; And that was my &#8220;Well I&#8217;m willing
        to take it on if I can have the responsibility. You can&#8217;t use my
        name on this any longer unless you give me the responsibility.&#8221; And
        that was that transition but that it almost absolutely killed the code. <br>
        And I tend to think some of the things that went on later were kinds
        of hurdles that were still put in the way by those that were opposed
        to the code. Because the only thing you heard after we got version 2,
        or a revision of the first version done... I wanted to put more pressure
        on the Steering Committee to get some support for a website. So I sent
        the follow up message that said, &#8220;Where are you guys? Haven&#8217;t
      heard from you.&#8221; And that was the tone of it.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: To the Steering Committee?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: To the Steering Committee. &#8220;Where are you guys? Haven&#8217;t
        heard from you.&#8221; There was no question; we now had a group that
        could rightly be called a working group because they all were. It was
        great fun. Now Davis pulled out of that and I didn&#8217;t hear anything
        more and didn&#8217;t even know about Davis&#8217;s original contribution
        to the code until almost six months later. And I sent to the Steering
        Committee, &#8220;Now we&#8217;ve got this deadline for this publication,&#8221; and
        so on. And they didn&#8217;t respond and so we got it into the Bulletin
        of Computers in Society, and got an edition of it out. </p>
      <p>After that edition hit the press we got a strange message from the steering
        committee that what they wanted was for us to say in the front of any
        future publications to have a, to write a memo that says that this isn&#8217;t
        really the Code of Ethics. That it is out there for consideration and
        it doesn&#8217;t have any lawful standard or anything like that. And
        it was a &#8220;minimize the publication&#8221; and they had appointed
        someone named Stewart Feldman to write this memo. </p>
      <p>Tactics come into play there. You knew that if this memo was written
        in the legalities that would said, no one would read the code with any
        impact. So what we did is another standard tactic that you should do
        on a committee. That is if you&#8217;re worried about the way they go,
        you take control and do the work for them. And then rather than them
        doing the work, they&#8217;ll accept the work you did. I don&#8217;t
        know if I said that clearly.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Yeah. Instead of having this outside person draft this sort of framing
        memo, that you would draft the framing memo in language that allowed
        that this wasn&#8217;t an official document but won&#8217;t water it...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: But won&#8217;t water it down. But I mean that&#8217;s a standard
        approach I use that when I&#8217;m worried about the way a committee
        will go, I will volunteer. And I&#8217;ll write the minutes, or I&#8217;ll
        write the whatever. And that will make sure that some of the things I
        worry about, maybe mistakenly will not occur. So we wrote the memo based
        on some things that Mario Barbacci had written for the Steering Committee
        a year or so earlier. So Feldman accepted this and we put it in the front
        of future publications.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So the version went out in the Bulletin of Computers in Society
        had no cover. It was just stated.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Well it was stated that it was a draft and that we were looking
        for comments and so on. I write it by that because that was truly its
        intent. You know, where are we going? Interestingly enough, when you
        ask Stewart Feldman about his involvement recently in some work being
        done on the Code of Ethics, an attempt to interview him has been denied
        because he&#8217;s said he&#8217;s had nothing to do with this. But emails
        to and from him are in the archive related to this. </p>
      <p>So this then proceeds and we now start to get comments on version 2
        and continue this iterative process. And documenting everything we&#8217;re
        doing all along the way.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: I do have one thing, can I ask? The version you were sending out,
        you consider that to be version 2? The one that you were publicizing,
        putting out in the Bulletin and all that?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Right, version 1 that was written by Michael Davis didn&#8217;t
        make any publication that I know of other than things that Michael has
        written about it. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: What were you looking for in the comments? In other words, were
        you looking for all kinds of substantive ideas or was this more of a
        question of trying to get in touch with people who objections and might
        try to push the code one way or the other? Because when you asked for
        comments, you could get thousands of comments and the job of sorting
        through them could become out of control. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong> : Yes.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You said that with a smile by the way, a knowing smile.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes, you know you invite thousands of comments but you&#8217;ve
        just worked through with eight working groups of which you&#8217;ve gotten
        material from seriously interested folk who either hate it or love it
        or are committed to the project. So the comments you got were things
        like, &#8220;You know this really doesn&#8217;t belong here and we should
        have a management section.&#8221; &#8220;You know this section that describes
        discrimination, misses out on this.&#8221; Comments, hoping for better
        completeness, better articulation. Criticisms catch text that you write
        that could be subject to misinterpretation. So if someone misinterprets,
        if someone reads this in a certain way, I have the assumption that it
        isn&#8217;t their fault that they&#8217;re stupid, it&#8217;s my fault
        that I didn&#8217;t write it in a way that they could understand. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: It&#8217;s a bit of user testing in a sort of way.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes. And correcting it so... And the presumption being that there&#8217;s
        some problem with this. Now admittedly we&#8217;d sometimes get comments,
        people at Microsoft said it&#8217;s not the developer&#8217;s responsibility
        to do testing; it&#8217;s the customer&#8217;s responsibility to do testing.
        And we flat out rejected that. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Curious. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Two people from, only two people from Microsoft commented and that
        was the same comment from both of them, which was strange. And that&#8217;s
        the kind of thing that you say, &#8220;Well that doesn&#8217;t fit what
        we understand software engineering to be.&#8221; You also were looking
        to capture what the profession thought software engineering to be, not
        what Joe of the ACM, and Heinz of Germany and so on thought but what
        the profession thought.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: A kind of reasonable center of mainstream opinion.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Now some of the things would in some context appear controversial.
        Like you have a duty to report when someone is doing something wrong
        as a software engineer and you know it. Even though it isn&#8217;t in
        your project, if it in any way damaging to society or the profession
        you have a duty to talk about it. </p>
      <p>Other things we did while building the code was to address known criticisms
        of codes of ethics. There&#8217;s a standard article by a philosopher
        John Ladd written twenty-some-odd years ago, where he criticizes codes
        of ethics because they&#8217;re self-serving to defend a profession against
        attacks, that they don&#8217;t give you any way to use the code, that
        they don&#8217;t help you prioritize issues. Like the Ten Commandments
        have ten absolute laws and if two of them occur in a situation in conflict
        you have no idea what to do. So one of the things we did to address this
        is was to build a preamble to the code and to add significantly to the
        front end of the code, not the imperatives, but a statement that says, &#8220;This
        is what this code of ethics is intended to do. When you are in situations
        that have conflict, do this. When you need to make your judgments, this
        is a way in which we suggest you order things.&#8221; </p>
      <p>In this version of the code, we made, I made a mistake, two mistakes.
        One mistake was...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Maybe we should hold there and continue the two mistakes on the
        next side of the tape just so we don&#8217;t cut them off. </p>
      <p><strong>[end of tape 3 side A]</strong></p>
      <p>DG: So as we&#8217;re moving
        along, following this schedule that I&#8217;d
        laid out part of the schedule had asked for the Steering Committee to
        define for us very early on what the formal process of approval would
        be once we had written a finished code and gone by all the standards
        I had outlined. That again, never came back from the Steering Committee.
        And it was again by design on my part and others&#8217; suggestions that
        we move this thing through in a variety of ways. But part of the process
        was to get public review at every stage possible. We had now version
        2 that was ready for revision and we were getting comments from people
        and voted on by the ethics taskforce, the group that was now working
        on the code, which had a significant number of people. And version 3,
        while version 3 was getting ready one of the mistakes we made was to
        have the graduate student at the center write out the ballot that was
        going to get published with it. Our ballot was one of these five part &#8220;strongly
        agree, agree, no opinion, disagree, strongly disagree&#8221; type of
        ballot and the graduate student was just to list the clauses and put
        summary statements. And the mistake might have been better characterized
        as us not carefully reviewing that ballot but thinking it was okay because
        it fit our first glance. The problem was that the way the ballot was
        stated for I think it was Principle 2.5 at that point, which said, &#8220;Respect
        cultural diversity.&#8221; Now when you get into the United States and
        you talk about cultural diversity and respecting cultural diversity it
        is a very political hot button and it does not adequately describe a
        clause that is intended to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t discriminate.&#8221; So
      that phrasing we think lead to a negative response. That was one mistake. </p>
      <p>The second mistake I think in version 3 was my mine. I had a number
        of years before written an article trying to explain what I considered
        to be the levels of computer ethics. Characterizing one level as the
        level of standard humanity; we don&#8217;t hurt other human beings, we
        help human beings and so on, and we act respectfully towards them. The
        second level being the level that professionals have in that all professionals
        owe a higher order of care. The third level being the particular profession&#8217;s
        standards. So owing a higher order of care as a software engineer means
        I will design a human-computer interface that won&#8217;t hurt you. Owing
        a higher order of care as a psychological counselor means that I will
        not reveal private information about you and so on. So I had this wonderful
        theory. Now one of the criticisms early on of the code was that version
        1 had some elements that looked aspirational and some elements that looked
        disciplinary. And in that, those early criticisms of version 1...</p>
      <p>TM: Just to fill in the record again I think we talked about disciplinary
        before but could you make the contrast to aspirational and disciplinary.</p>
      <p>DG: Aspirational doesn&#8217;t tell you a specific idea, it says try
        to do the best you can. Disciplinary say do this specific thing. Although
        version 1 didn&#8217;t have specific penalties if you didn&#8217;t do
        the specific thing, the Steering Committee...</p>
      <p>TM: The earlier ACM code had been heavily disciplinary.</p>
      <p>DG: Right, and then it got replaced by a more normative one. The Steering
        Committee in their comments, in their published comments about version
        1 were worried about the distinction about aspirational and disciplinary
        being in the same code. So what I thought what I would do is in the preamble
        stick a distinction that I just mentioned to you about levels of professionalisms.
        So that in some places a code of ethics can simply say, &#8220;Be honest
        and don&#8217;t hurt people,&#8221; well that&#8217;s one of the levels
        of professionalism. The other place it can say, &#8220;In your work as
        a software tester do this kind of testing,&#8221; and that&#8217;s the
        third level of professionalism I characterized. So I put this in the
        preamble and version 3 is now ready to go out to the world and I&#8217;m
        ready to head home to Tennessee from my visit in England. </p>
      <p>According to my schedule it was supposed to be published in the IEEE
        Computer, which is the main, the flagship journal of the IEEE Computer
        Society. And it was supposed to be published in the Communications in
        the ACM. Following a model that had been, when asked about, actually
        supported by Mario Barbacci to me in our private conversation, I sent
        the journal, I sent the article to the Communications in the ACM and
        to IEEE Computer. </p>
      <p>TM: Are these transactions or communications?</p>
      <p>DG: Communications in the ACM. CACM is the abbreviation. And called
        each of them saying, &#8220;Here is the article as agreed upon in my
        memo to the Steering Committee represented by,&#8221; and it was then
        one of the people who would become president of the ACM and then one
        of the people who would become president of the IEEE, &#8220;And this
        is our agreement to publish the process of this.&#8221; I&#8217;ve already
        laid out the approval process that I spoke about. That is they had no
        comment so that was approval. The publishers went and agreed to publication.
        It got a little bit...</p>
      <p>TM: In both... </p>
      <p>DG: In both journals. One of them, the IEEE Computer wanted to publish
        it in October. The Communications of the ACM wanted to publish it in
        November because they had this long lead time for articles of that length.
        We wrote a wrapper on the front that said... We wrote an introduction
        to the code that says here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on, here&#8217;s
        what the committee has done, here&#8217;s the code, here&#8217;s the
        ballot, please fax the ballot, and send it in. We had no support for
        a website so you couldn&#8217;t, we didn&#8217;t say we have no support
        for a website... This thing was to be commented on and sent it. Both
        journals agreed to publish it. ACM in November, IEEE in October. IEEE
        publication goes on and you hear nothing about the Code. Then you look
        at the IEEE Computer and you realize that the article is published in
        the middle of the journal without a reference to it appearing in the
        table of contents or anyplace else. So unless people read the journal
        from cover to cover they would not know that there was an article in
        there.</p>
      <p>TM: It was not listed on the title page.</p>
      <p>DG: It was not listed in the table of contents.</p>
      <p>TM: Table of contents. </p>
      <p>DG: Or any place else on the document. I called the editors of IEEE
        and I called Mario Barbacci. Having the right and powerful people on
        your side is also a significant way to get things done. Mario was on
        the side of &#8220;let&#8217;s get things moving&#8221;. And what happened
        was they agreed to publish it again the following issue; this time in
        the table of contents, this time an announcement on the spine that it
        was the draft Code of Ethics. That becomes the November event. Then we
        have all of the ballots coming back.</p>
      <p>TM: And your belief is that Mario asked the editors to do the...</p>
      <p>DG: I&#8217;ve forgotten which way it went. It was either Mario said, &#8220;Yes,
        use my name,&#8221; or Mario made the call. I don&#8217;t remember the
        way it went. It was with his blessing, and you have to think of these
        editors who have consumed four pages in one edition and four pages in
        the other edition and say exactly the same thing. And there&#8217;s a
        certain ethical issue here because somebody&#8217;s article probably
        didn&#8217;t appear because this appeared a second time. I mean that
        may have occurred but I don&#8217;t know but that&#8217;s an issue.</p>
      <p>TM: Right okay. Is it important enough to kill all those extra trees?
        And the answer with this one is probably yes. But there&#8217;s ethical
        dimension in most of the things that we do.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Right. So we&#8217;re still getting comments back on version 2.
        We&#8217;ve got version 3. We&#8217;re getting the ballots back on version
        3. I have a student helping to collect the ballots. We&#8217;re organizing
        stuff and getting responses. I contact the Steering Committee and I think
        at this moment I&#8217;ve forgotten who Frailey&#8217;s colleague, IEEE
        colleague was on the Steering Committee. But I say, &#8220;This has all
        been done. I&#8217;ve been following the schedule. You have this December
        deadline.&#8221; And I am told that &#8220;the committee may be going
        out of existence.&#8221; The Steering Committee may go out of existence
        in December and put in a file all of those things that were not accomplished.
        So now you have this very simple pressure which seems to me if we don&#8217;t
        finish the code by December all of this work is going to go into a file
        drawer and we&#8217;ll hear, &#8220;Thank you anyway. We appreciate your
        effort.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And you heard this as a rumor?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: This one came from Frailey that we had to move on quickly because.
        And as I heard this I went back to that comment in February of &#8217;95
        at the meeting where he said to me, &#8220;The ACM may be pulling out&#8221; And
        I tied some of those together rather than it just being something about
        our committee not making progress because the other committees were not
        making progress.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: The one on education and body of knowledge.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Education was waiting for body of knowledge to get done. And those
        people who thought linearly thought body of knowledge should get done,
        education should get done, and ethics should get done reflecting on this.
        And if we had let occur there would be nothing; if we had bought into
        that linear relationship. So now you hear from Frailey about this..</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Just a quick sort of fast forward. Those other two taskforces did
        they complete a significant body of work or did they...?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Ultimately they did in the same way we did, which was to abandon
        the IEEE model and use our own model. That is what happens is, a group
        of, two very savvy, workaholic, closure freaks in Canada said they&#8217;ll
        take on the project. That is they took it on and organized it and sent
        out a message and got people who would work and they worked through.
        And yes there is a body of knowledge that is a standard now. And that
        is a result of...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And those two Canadian, control freak, workaholics do you know their
        names? Just so the record is clear because it&#8217;s these three forces
        moving...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I know. Pierre, Pierre is one of them who had nothing to do with
        any of the original stuff on the body of knowledge. The original stuff
        on the body of knowledge had interference with companies like IBM and
        other things, interference/support. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: We can fill that in later.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Pierre Bourque and I&#8217;ve lost his name. [Robert Dupuis]</p>
      <p>We&#8217;re now in September/October when I hear this exciting news
        about December. So I tell Dennis if it&#8217;s going to happen we have
        all these ballots coming in and we&#8217;d need to have a meeting. The &#8220;we&#8221; being
        the three members of the steering committee, Miller, Gotterbarn, and
        Rogerson, and we need some funding for that. And typical of the Steering
        Committee the very first debate was &#8220;Well how much is each society
        going to contribute?&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Oh no!</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And then it became, &#8220;Well we&#8217;ll split the bill 50/50.&#8221; And
        you go, &#8220;Excuse me you&#8217;re going to have billing coming from
        three people at different amounts and each society,&#8221; I had to ultimately
        do the accounting like this. And it became one of those stupid things
        that said, &#8220;Well Gotterbarn spent this many dollars, this many
        dollars, Rogerson spent this many dollars, this many dollars. So if we
        add this portion of Miller&#8217;s to this one and this portion of Miller&#8217;s
        to Rogerson it comes out with a ten dollar difference at the bottom.&#8221; But
        you needed to have receipts. So you had to figure out how to balance
        the receipts. One of the ways to waste five hours of your time is to
        make this work out, so it was within ten dollars. </p>
      <p>We got the financial support. I arranged for a hotel room in Baltimore.
        I could reach Baltimore easily. Miller who was then in southern Illinois
        could reach Baltimore using Southwest Airlines cheap. Rogerson could
        get a direct flight to Baltimore from London. There&#8217;s a hotel I
        had done some work in before. They had every room was actually a suite
        with a living room kind of area and a bedroom area. We met, got together
        and met each bringing laptops and I having a pile of document with all
        of the comments and every thing going on. And we sat in this room and
        we worked version 3 given all of the comments into version 4. The number
        of changes, we made changes in structure, changes in the grammar of some
        of the statements. </p>
      <p>Everybody, now here&#8217;s a thing that was discovered in the comments.
        What I had put in the preamble where I distinguished things into three
        different levels half of the comments were you&#8217;ve got to revise
        the code and distinguish which of each of the imperatives corresponds
        to which of the levels, and we knew that whatever we did in that kind
        of division would just generate new excuses for criticism and would not
        be productive. That is if we put something down as professional and not
        technical professional someone would say that would belongs in professional.
        If we put something in purely humanity level someone would say, &#8220;No
        it&#8217;s professional.&#8221; So we simply erased that and pulled that
        out of the code, because I would say fully half of the comments that
        responded negatively were about that. </p>
      <p>It was heartening because most of the items... I&#8217;m going to have
        the wrong issue with the numbers but most of the items received better
        than 90% approval. And it was wonderful to see some of them come in.
        Some of them were upset because of the grammar of things and they would
        argue against one clause but the one clause about diversity got about
        a 70% approval. It was the only one that dropped below 90%. Now those
        people who said, &#8220;I strongly approve,&#8221;...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Are you saying it was a question of people responding the kind of
        politically correct language that...?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: That was where we... We look at this and wondered who would object
        to a &#8220;Don&#8217;t discriminate&#8221; clause, because other kinds
        of thing, the preamble of the codes says you&#8217;re going to work hard
        for other human beings to try to forward human safety and so on, and
        then to say but you should discriminate doesn&#8217;t seem to be consistent.
        And so we looked at it and then we looked at the ballot and we kind of
        looked at each other and it&#8217;s the kind of moment where you hit
        yourself in the head for not having seen something that was obvious before.
        Miller and I looked at it and said, &#8220;The Americans seeing &#8216;political
        diversity&#8217; would go, &#8216;What&#8217;s that doing in the Code
        of Ethics?&#8217;,&#8221; or something like that.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Cultural diversity, wasn&#8217;t that your phrase?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Cultural diversity, yes. And it was just didn&#8217;t... We realized,
        or we had a hunch that this is what the problem was.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And how did you deal with that issue?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: We had this vote that it was still 70% but we rephrased the code
        in a couple of ways. I still learned a lot from the ACM process, which
        isn&#8217;t that we modeled the physical ACM but we avoided some of the
        errors we had made in building the ACM code. I was able to bring some
        of that experience to try and avoid some of those errors in this code.
        One of the errors in the ACM code was when we had written it we had a
        clause that said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t discriminate on the basis of religion,
        on the basis of sex, and on the basis of race,&#8221; and we had a period.
        Several of the comments that come in when the ACM code in the early 1990s
        had got out for ballot were that you left out discrimination on sexual
        preference; you left out discrimination on trans-dressing, you left out
        discrimination on... And what we realized is that whenever you put in
        a list, every new group as you begin to learn that you&#8217;ve been
        stupid. I mean in the 1960s we didn&#8217;t have, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
        discriminate on the basis of sex.&#8221; It was in the &#8216;70s with
        the women&#8217;s movement that they brought it to our conciseness that
        we&#8217;ve been pretty stupid before. So as you put a list in, at some
        point we will learn something better and you have to change the code.
        So what the ACM did was pull out the list and say, I&#8217;ve forgotten
        the way the clause goes but it&#8217;s something like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
        discriminate on irrelevant grounds.&#8221; We always make discriminations.
        I make discriminations about what kind of car to buy but I base it on
        cost and efficiency and so on, not whether the guy who put the tires
        on is a Nazi. Don&#8217;t make, don&#8217;t discriminate on irrelevant
        grounds or something like that. I&#8217;ve forgotten the line but something
        like that. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Could I ask a reflective question? I see the procedural problem
        with enumerating the various classes of people that you&#8217;re not
        suppose to discriminate against and then sets the code up to be a kind
        of time capsule. You can see that it&#8217;s from the &#8216;70s or &#8216;80s
        or &#8216;90s or some other decade. But is it also the case that you
        say that by stating say a statement on sexual preference or some other
        criteria that you&#8217;re actually being more specific then the code
        would have greater bite? In other words somebody would say, &#8220;Irrelevant
        criteria, but I would never discriminate on irrelevant criteria,&#8221; although
        they might not be sensitized for the discrimination that unthinkingly
        they do.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes, there&#8217;s this balance. Yes, that&#8217;s an issue. They
        way this one had been... I think we ended up shortening it in the way,
        leaving it open to that criticism.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Not enumerating specific ones.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes, not enumerating specific ones. You would have a tough time
        in today&#8217;s society saying that sex is a relevant issue, in which
        to do discrimination of hiring unless you&#8217;re talking about dancers
        at clubs or something like that. So those were the initial sorts of things.
        You started to look at the questions and it was a set of, a period of
        time. I do my standard model of &#8220;Let&#8217;s start and keep going
        until we get done&#8221; and that became a bit of a joke. But Rogerson
        became the scribe and Miller and I were going around working with the
        stuff and Rogerson working with the stuff and keeping track of all the
        changes. But then we started to look at the code...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Rogerson was your scribe?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes, Rogerson, Simon Rogerson was the guy who was sitting at the
        one PC. Miller and I joke about being old guys and we work better tearing
        up pieces of paper than modifying things real time on a computer. </p>
      <p>And we discussed every question, and then there were those... Part of
        the process that went on was as you start to discuss every question one
        of the three of us as you get on to the third, or fourth, or fifth set
        of suggestions is noticing a trend of some sort and realizing that the
        code is leading towards a misinterpretation because of something that
        it wasn&#8217;t pointing to. So the original draft that Davis had done
        had started out with &#8220;Product&#8221; as the first thing because
        Davis had this thing in terms of what was most important in impact. And
        within about, I don&#8217;t know how the time went, but at some period
        in time we said, &#8220;You know, we&#8217;ve got one or two people who&#8217;d
        say, &#8216;You&#8217;ve got to rearrange these things.&#8217; Someone
        would say, &#8216;Why is product first?&#8221; And you&#8217;d say, &#8216;our
        point in this code is to say that as a software engineer the very first
        and most important consideration is the impact of what you&#8217;re doing
        on the public&#8217;. So we flicked &#8216;Public&#8217; up into the
        first clause. And we started to restructure the clauses, and I&#8217;ve
        forgotten how the restructuring went, but we restructured it based on
        what we considered as we&#8217;re reading the comments and as we talk
        among ourselves the order of these major principles, major categories. </p>
      <p>Then as you start to look at the categories, and we&#8217;re going over
        each one. And it was interesting to watch as an afterthought I mean there
        was thought in the air. It&#8217;s a stupid comment but we&#8217;d read
        some clauses, we&#8217;d read some comments, we&#8217;d read some clauses,
        and one of us would click about something that had gone on before and
        say, &#8220;You know, this is the problem we had here and it was the
        same kind of thing there,&#8221; and they&#8217;d see a relationship.
        And we&#8217;d restructure it, move an item down, change some of the
        wording and we did all of this restructuring in the light of these comments,
        in light of what we knew, in the intention of what was going on. </p>
      <p>And we had another underlying motive. Working with the joint committee
        of the IEEE and ACM, Steering Committee, having them do something together
        was amazingly significant because the fact that those two groups worked
        together and produced a document of some sort meant wonderful stuff.
        We also had the view, given all the things that had gone on before, that
        this was not something that was likely to happen again since they would
        abandon ship in December. So we built a code of ethics and guide to professional
        conduct and we clearly articulated that this was both a code of ethics
        and a guide to conduct. So we had two levels of code in the same breath.
        Some of the people later objected to that but part of our motivation
        was this was the one chance we had and if we lost it then it was gone.
        And we went on for hours, just as you&#8217;re probably experiencing
        this with me now, but when you&#8217;re having fun and you&#8217;re making
        progress...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Yes, just as a point of fact it&#8217;s 3 am and we&#8217;ve been
        at this for seventeen hours straight. It&#8217;s not that bad. As a point
        of fact it&#8217;s 5:48 and it&#8217;s pm. </p>
      <p>TM: You&#8217;ve also described, we can get this on take down, but a
        certain kind of real joy and amaze in a kind of secret accord between
        the three of you because it felt like you were doing something really
        significant and that your work really clicked together.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I picked these people, no I&#8217;m taking credit. I was lucky enough
        to have met these people at interesting points. Remember Miller&#8217;s
        name comes into the story in 1989. When in 1989 an article appeared in
        the Chronicle of Higher Education that named the three people they could
        find in the United States doing computer ethics; Spafford, Gotterbarn,
        and Deborah Johnson. Miller should also have been on that list; practitioner
        set of values. Rogerson when I first met him it was in relation to the
        early days of this committee, when Bob was still involved and before
        I ended up going to Rogerson&#8217;s center. </p>
      <p>In 1996 in July, I was at a conference in England, the Professional
        Awareness in Software Engineering Conference. I was presenting a paper
        on software engineering ethics and a report on what the Steering Committee
        was doing, so I had two presentations. Rogerson had a paper and his paper
        was entitled &#8220;The Ethics of Software Project Management&#8221;,
        and he was bemoaning the absence of an ethical approach and the consequences
        of doing things and you could see... There was a synergy instantly between
        myself and the audience, and him up there. In fact I&#8217;ve been working
        on an ethics risk analysis process so when he was saying he didn&#8217;t
        know how to handle it we still joke about my arm shot up and I offered
        him an answer. And I said, &#8220;Do this process, do this analysis and
        so on.&#8221; We spoke shortly after that, after he presented his paper,
        and he invited me to his center, the next week brought me back over in
        an effort to bring me over during my sabbatical year. And that&#8217;s
        how the Rogerson connection was established. </p>
      <p>But the interesting thing is that, is the set of things. Three people
        from very different backgrounds, the tie is that we&#8217;re very committed
        to a sense of that we&#8217;re willing to fit every moment of negative
        space to this project. I mean, the amount of time that these guys put
        in is just amazing. We&#8217;re committed to the same value set. Miller
        has taught other faculty members how to teach computer ethics. He&#8217;s
        still writing in the field. He still works with computers. Rogerson has
        the center. I have the center. Rogerson and I work on conferences in
        Europe on computer ethics. And you got together, and there was no question
        in the room; we had an opportunity, we had, we hoped the collective intelligence,
        we had the commitment and value set. It was really interesting because
        it was never an issue of, &#8220;You&#8217;re going the wrong thing,&#8221; in
        the discussion it was, &#8220;Maybe we can say it better this way. Maybe
        we can say it better this way.&#8221; </p>
      <p>I&#8217;m the grammatical Philistine in the crowd. Miller has a wonderful
        sense of prose, Rogerson would bring in his English Literary background,
        and they would structure sentencing. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to say this,&#8221; and
        I&#8217;d say it in some barbaric fashion. And Miller would say things
        like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s put it this way. If you have a judgment to make
        you consider first who it would impact, whether it can apply to the...,&#8221; and
        wonderful turnss of phrase in the preamble, which totally are his doing.
        Thoughts Rogerson and I... And it was a process where you did this for
        a couple of hours and you said, &#8220;Okay us as...&#8221; I mean, the
        fun part was us as old folks at five or six o&#8217;clock at night say, &#8220;We
        need paper copies of this to think about tonight.&#8221; We&#8217;d go
        to a Kinko&#8217;s to get it printed. We&#8217;d go with, at that time,
        floppy disks to the Kinko&#8217;s. They couldn&#8217;t get their printer
        to work and they said, &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t get it printed.&#8221; We
        couldn&#8217;t allow that. They didn&#8217;t know what they were hit
        with All of a sudden, &#8220;Well what&#8217;s wrong with your printer?&#8221; </p>
      <p>&#8220;Well we don&#8217;t know we&#8217;re not very good.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re computer scientists.&#8221;</p>
      <p> <strong>TM</strong>: We should be able to figure this out.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And it was a stupid loose connection at the back of the printer
        but you know you did all the software stuff first because you thought
        they&#8217;d check the hardware. You print this out, for each of us,
        we had dinner and we went back. I don&#8217;t think we worked that night
        because it was, travel had been involved. But the next day we came back
        and in the morning and put another whole day in. And I think pretty much
        we had a wrap on it, checked everything, looked at all this and we had
        version 4.0 at the end of that day. And we went our ways. It&#8217;s
        really amazing because I look at Rogerson&#8217;s description of that
        event during the interview and Miller&#8217;s description of that event
        in a private letter to Michael Davis and it&#8217;s, this was... You
        had just as you said three people, same set of values, all working to
        a common goal, and you knew that if we could get it together then all
        of this work might make a difference. And it seems to have. </p>
      <p>So we went our way. Rogerson sent me the documents. I made a few other
        corrections. And it took a couple of days and I put together a message
        to the Steering Committee. &#8220;Here is 4.0. This has got the votes,&#8221; told
        them what the votes had been, 90% for most of these things, &#8220;Here
        is the structure, here is what we have done, here is how we responded
        to things.&#8221; I&#8217;m sorry before I sent it to the Steering Committee
        I sent it out to the ethics group again, and said, &#8220;Any comments.
        What have we missed? Have we got, is there any sense to it?&#8221; Some
        things came back and I made some modifications to it because yep, they
        were right and we missed something. Then I sent it off to the Steering
        Committee and said... Now notice it&#8217;d gone since that February
        now to December without them telling me what an approval process would
        be like. So I did the same thing again, I defined it and said, &#8220;We
        hope that you will approve this code and send it with your recommendation
        to the governing bodies of the ACM and IEEE Computer Society recommending
        their approval.&#8221; Nothing. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: There&#8217;s a pattern here</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I have a pattern too. </p>
      <p><strong>[end of tape 3 side B] </strong></p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Okay, we&#8217;re on tape again. Don Gotterbarn being interviewed
        by Tom Misa, 22 September 2005. Don&#8217;s summarizing this year.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: The year 1997 was an interesting year because it has so many lessons
        to be learned. One of them that I find as great fun is the number of
        errors and kinds of mistakes that got made. The original project started
        out in a fruitless direction to identify ethical standards in an ill-defined
        way, in a way that nobody really understood what was going on. Because
        of some confusion about the way in which technology operates, Ed Mechler
        took over the subgroup of the Professional Competence group, and put
        together what they thought was supposed to be a code of ethics rather
        than a list of standards. Michael Davis organized those into a useful
        structure. Both of these activities could be considered mistakes. </p>
      <p>Further ahead into the politics of this was a significant political
        error of just violating the chain of command and somebody from a committee
        that nobody had heard of sends to the general of the Steering Committee
        final results; opening all of the political hatchets and knives and activity
        going on. That almost spelled disaster for the project. Again what was
        presented now as a code of ethics was now a deliverable. It was at this
        point the only deliverable from any of the taskforces that the Steering
        Committee had initially set up. Because people were committed to the
        code of ethics, other kinds of things went on, other mistakes were made.
        Advocacy of publication in several journals and a potential disaster
        of having to put a statement at the front of these article that said, &#8220;It
        doesn&#8217;t really mean anything, don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; was
        then responded to in a way again where it was fixed by a cover message.
        And I&#8217;m loosing my theme because what I want to do is sum up the
        mistakes. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You&#8217;re doing the kind of narrative summary of all of the...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Yes, I wanted to characterize them as mistakes. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So you wanted to draw out some lessoned learned.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And so, one of the alleged mistakes was modifying the code in the
        ways we did in Baltimore because we made some significant modifications.
        The end result of that, set of taking license, which could be viewed
        as a political mistake, ended up to be quite valuable. Followed by the
        next set of mistakes. In December of that year the code was submitted
        to the steering committee. Nothing was heard from the Steering Committee.
        Gotterbarn did not know whether it was in existence or out of existence
        anymore. So given the plan that he had originally suggested, that of
        recommending the code to each of the governing boards, Gotterbarn choose...
        I sent the letter that I had sent to the Steering Committee to both the
        ACM Council and the Board of Governors of the IEEE saying that I had
        heard nothing from the Steering Committee. Quickly I heard from two people
        who had been on the Steering Committee indicating that I should not have
        done this, another political mistake, but what had been done was to make
        the code public again outside of the Steering Committee as an accomplishment
        going around any opposition on the Steering Committee. </p>
      <p>The sets of mistakes that were made, my relying on a procedure to develop
        software standards and it having to fail, led to or made possible Ed&#8217;s
        development of the code standards. Each of these pieces is interesting
        to me because I don&#8217;t think the code would be where it got to at
        this point if you took away any of these so called mistakes. It&#8217;s
        my belief that the ethics taskforce would have gone out of existence,
        still floundering wondering what ethical standards were with nothing
        accomplished. I&#8217;ll go back to the narrative now. You look like
        you have a question.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: No, that&#8217;s fine.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: We now enter a period of time where code is attempted to be approved.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Now we move into 1998?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: 1998, I guess, yeah. And the code version 4.0 has been submitted
        and we&#8217;re still receiving comments now on 3.0 that was published
        in the September and October editions of Computer and of the Communications
        of the ACM. Chasing down meetings of the ACM council gets to be quick
        tricky. Consistent with communications difficulties, two people who were
        on the Steering Committee, Leonard Trip, an ex-president of the IEEE
        Computer Society, and standards director for the IEEE Computer Society
        and standards director at Boeing in Seattle, and Dennis Frailey of Raytheon
        and the ACM, have been working to continue the software engineering enterprise
        of the Steering Committee, which is now, unbeknownst to me, fully out
        of existence. Fortunately, there&#8217;s a product on the table that
        is now quite public, which cannot be ignored. In several efforts to contact
        the committees nothing was successful. In May of that year, the ACM council
        was meeting in Washington DC. I arranged to have an item on the agenda
        related to the code and appeared in Washington D.C. at the council meeting.
        There was all sorts of confusion and misstatement, and all sorts of confusion
        going on about what was happening with the code because unbeknownst to
        me Frailey and Trip had submitted a proposal about the code which they
        had not communicated to me. I had submitted a proposal about the code
        that was for the ACM to approve the code. </p>
      <p>My bullet item came up first. It was quite interesting because some
        people asked questions about, &#8220;Well, have you submitted this code
        to review?&#8221; and seemed to be unaware about anything that had gone
        on in the Communications of the ACM. Even more interesting was one of
        the members of council who had been on the Steering Committee also seemed
        unaware of the existence of the code. As the code was being presented
        people pointed to the upcoming agenda item...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: And you were presenting version 4?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I was presenting version 4 for adoption.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: The Baltimore...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: The Baltimore...the slightly revised Baltimore version. There were
        some revisions after it came out of Baltimore. I don&#8217;t remember
        what they were, but they were slight but respected. That was we said
        it was important to do it.</p>
      <p>Then you hear from a representative from Dennis Frailey so the message
        is boggled, the message is corrupted, that there&#8217;s some type of
        other review that needs to be done. The other review was to put the code
        through an IEEE Technical Standards Review. It was being suggested by
        Dennis Frailey and the ex-president of the IEEE Computer Society. I thought
        the battle was over and lost because a technical review for most items
        takes several years. I went back home quite deflated and called Leonard
        Trip who was the IEEE-Computer Society ex-president. Leonard explained
        the review process...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You mean the IEEE Computer Society?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: The IEEE Computer Society. Leonard explained that he had a review
        process in mind. I&#8217;d never worked with Leonard before. It was a
        little bit scary because I didn&#8217;t know whether, I had no understanding
        of his politics and his battle. I had pretty much scoped out everyone
        else&#8217;s politics and that&#8217;s why, in part, the code got to
        this stage. Now there was this voice from Seattle that was quite organized,
        quite businesslike and said, &#8220;No it will not take five years. This
        is what I have a plan for,&#8221; and it would take a matter of about
        five months, or six months to do.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: This is the IEEE Standards Review?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: The IEEE Technical Standards Review. And the review process was
        a fairly interesting process where they ask for voters, people who want
        to vote on this. Then they have a way of making a balanced voting pool
        to make sure that it isn&#8217;t all of the employees of a particular
        company, or all of the employees for another company, or all of the people
        from one country, and so on.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Because of the problem with technical standards having direct proprietary
        commercial consequences. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Well, it could if you built certain things into it. There&#8217;s
        some legal stuff that we&#8217;ll go into a separate discussion on. </p>
      <p>So this is... So he asked me for people who I would recommend for this.
        So I sent him email lists of people that I had in an ethics list, sent
        him a list of the then ethics taskforce members which still included
        some of those people who had not contributed at any point. Nevertheless
        I was resistant to take them off the list. The list of voters got generated.
        The code procedure is that the code goes out and you vote &#8220;Yes&#8221;, &#8220;No&#8221;,
        or &#8220;Yes with reservations&#8221;. If you vote &#8220;Yes&#8221;,
        you&#8217;ve voted. If you vote &#8220;Yes with reservations&#8221; it
        means you voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; but you&#8217;re making some suggestions
        that might or might not be followed. If you vote &#8220;No&#8221; you
        had to state exactly the reason why you voted &#8220;No&#8221; and what
        would lead you to vote &#8220;Yes&#8221;. We got back approximately 136
        comments. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>TM</strong>: From this Technical Standards Review?</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>DG</strong>: From this first level, layer of the Technical Standards Review. The
          next step in the process is to go over all of the responses, modify
          the code as the committee sees fit, and send it out to the voting group
          again. Those people who voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; could vote &#8220;No&#8221; if
          you changed the code in a way that offends them. Those people who voted &#8220;No&#8221; could
          say, there were some people who if you did exactly what they said in
          their &#8220;No&#8221; vote, their vote was automatically changed to
          yes. And those people who you did some of it or explained why you didn&#8217;t
          do it could change their vote to &#8220;Yes&#8221; or leave it as &#8220;No&#8221;,
          but it&#8217;s an up or down vote at this stage. So you now have comments
          some of which are impossible. They come from a committee where they&#8217;ll
          say, &#8220;It has too much normative ethics. It has too much applied
          ethics. Now I&#8217;ll give you contradictory comments.&#8221; So you
          can&#8217;t do anything with them. I received these and this is now
          September, I think. And I went and started the school year and in this
          negative time I went through every comment and wrote a potential response
          to each of them. </p>
      <p><br>
        These comments are by the way generally all put on the web. I violated
          the principle of this voting process because I called the IEEE and
          I said, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t put these two people&#8217;s comments
          on the web,&#8221; because they had not realized that their comments
          would go on the web. And one of them in discussing why he had voted
          a certain way said something like, &#8220;My wife works as treasurer
          for this church and her church is using a pirated piece of budget software,&#8221; and
          I thought inappropriate to reveal and the person didn&#8217;t realize
          the consequences of it. And there was a similar type of comment. We
          put the votes up but restricted some of those non-relevant asides.
          Otherwise it followed 100% the IEEE standard. Now, I rolled out...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: I&#8217;m just double checking, you said you had approximately 136
        comments and then each person would have an option for making a second
        round of comments?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: What happens is...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: There&#8217;s structured procedure...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: ...we respond...</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Some &#8220;no&#8221;s are automatically changed to &#8220;yes&#8221;s.
        So it&#8217;s a structured... </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And the final procedure is you vote. I don&#8217;t remember if there&#8217;s
        a comment place but you vote. And there&#8217;s not a questions it becomes
        up or down. And this is very nerve racking because some of the votes
        you know you can&#8217;t possibly change because they&#8217;re by contradictory
        desires. Other votes, the two from Microsoft you know you&#8217;re going
        to refuse to go along with because they say testing is the responsibility
        of the customer and you ought to delete the testing clause. And so there
        are those kinds of things and you have a limited approval votes and you
        need to be at a certain percentage. So you carefully evaluate all of
        these and you try and give, and you have several categories of response
        that is &#8220;I agree with and this is what I&#8217;m doing&#8221;, &#8220;I
        partially agree with and this is what I&#8217;m doing&#8221;, &#8220;No
        I don&#8217;t agree with you at all&#8221;, and &#8220;Tough&#8221;.
        So I wrote out this set of responses and fired them off to Miller and
        Rogerson, and I took a set of comments. </p>
      <p>Now another one of those meetings occurred. In the stuff Rogerson and
        I and others had been doing, we were helping to organize a series of
        ethics conferences called Computer Ethics for the Philosophical Enquiry
        and that was having a meeting at Dartmouth University. And Miller, Rogerson,
        and Gotterbarn were presenting papers there. Terry Bynum, who I mentioned
        earlier around this 1991 thing, has been active in computer ethics all
        the way through, and he was on sabbatical leave at Dartmouth University
        and had this room above a barn, two or three miles away from the university.
        Well, you got the trio together and we took all these comments and we
        went out to this room above a barn late one evening and Bynum... And
        we went through each of the response. I have a style of asserting things
        emphatically, enthusiastically and I rely on Miller and Rogerson to say, &#8220;Calm
        down Don. Say it this other way.&#8221; And one of the reasons we work
        well together is we all respect each other&#8217;s contributions and
        it fits that way. And we went through every one of these comments that
        I had made, modified them so that the three of us had agreement in modifying
        the code. The scary moment came... </p>
      <p>Then there was a conference the next day in Boston just a little south
        of Dartmouth that was a philosophy conference where I was giving a talk.
        When I got home within a matter of days I had the document that we had
        agreed on as a response. I sent it in to Leonard Trip and his organization
        that does this stuff. And they put it out for the ballot again. At that
        point you sit and you wait having no idea whether you have totally offended
        the world and they&#8217;re all going to vote negative, or what&#8217;s
        going to happen. </p>
      <p>If &#8220;Yes&#8221; voters don&#8217;t respond, it&#8217;s considered
        that they&#8217;re still voting &#8220;Yes&#8221;. &#8220;No&#8221; voters
        can have an automatic turn to &#8220;Yes&#8221; because you&#8217;ve
        met their requirements.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: If their conditions are met.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: If their conditions are met. And you can assert their conditions
        are met but the people at the IEEE looks and say what they wanted, and
        what you did, and they determine whether you&#8217;ve really met their
        conditions. Then other &#8220;No&#8221; voters if you said, &#8220;We
        can do this but we don&#8217;t want to do it this way because it may
        allow this interpretation and that&#8217;s why we wrote this thing this
        way.&#8221; Or, &#8220;What you want here is really handled in the preamble
        in the second clause and this thing is long enough already and we don&#8217;t
        want to add a second thing.&#8221; Those were the kinds of arguments
        you used. Sometimes it was flat out, &#8220;No this is unacceptable to
        a software engineer.&#8221;</p>
      <p>And I&#8217;ve forgotten how long after the vote came in but the vote
        came in with, &#8220;Yes it passed.&#8221; And it passed by, I&#8217;m
        not going to say anything more. I remember that it passed and it passed
        without it being a close call. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: The figures are part of the record somewhere else?</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>DG</strong>: Yes. It&#8217;s actually all of this is available on the web still
        at this moment. You can read every one of my comments. You can read every
        one of the issues. You can read the final vote. This is IEEE procedure,
        every thing is wide open. And that&#8217;s a useful procedure I believe.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So all of your comments...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: All of my comments as modified by Miller and Rogerson. So I have
        to be careful to not take credit that I&#8217;m the author of whatever
        great prose might be there. It&#8217;s the committee&#8217;s comments
        are there. I authored the first straw man of each of those and they modified
        them as necessary.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: If you went into the IEEE&#8217;s website is there an obvious way
        of navigating to this or is it for members only of IEEE?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: You can get to it but I don&#8217;t remember how. You&#8217;ll send
        me an email and I&#8217;ll try and get it to you. Or I think it may be
        in Davis&#8217;s book some place.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Because this is a nice level of documentation that somebody&#8217;s
        whose following up on this history might want to know the comments from
        somebody, might actually get the raw comments. That it&#8217;s also a
        kind of secondary archive that would be nice to know. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: So now you have this vote and you all of a sudden. Not all of a
        sudden, in further comments with Leonard Trip you realize that he&#8217;s
        the standards man and he would be happy if this passed. And you realize
        that he wasn&#8217;t against you. You pick up the politics a little bit
        later. That is was in fact an incredibly savvy political move that I
        had awareness of how smart it was. That&#8217;s probably the biggest
        political stupidity I had in all of this. But while I&#8217;m scared,
        I did everything to the letter on this thing. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: It was savvy in what way?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Well, now you&#8217;ve presented to the ACM again and you are asked, &#8220;Well,
        what makes you think software engineers accept this code?&#8221; You&#8217;re
        response is, &#8220;It went through the IEEE Technical Standards concept
        and passed the most rigorous form of testing currently available for
        a technical standard. &#8220; So it&#8217;s not wimpy. It&#8217;s done
        and there is no question about the evidence.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Have you any idea what the Technical Standards people thought about
        this, because this is not a standard technical standard? I mean it has
        nothing to do with the inside architecture of a chip or a wireless standard.
        This is something else.
      </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: I have no idea. The one thing that it was, is an accepted procedure
        for validating a document, and proving that the community of developers
        accepts it. So what this was not a vote that Gotterbarn was waving his
        hands about. This is, if you want to count the votes and see the comments
        you can go to the website today and read every one of them. I mean the
        brilliance of this, of forcing me through this, and following to the
        detail, meant when the ACM said, &#8220;Does it meets software engineering
      standards?&#8221; you go, &#8220;It meets it.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Then they ask, &#8220;Well how do we know this whole thing is consistent
        with the ACM Code of Ethics?&#8221; They say, &#8220;We need to have
        the Committee on Professional Ethics review it.&#8221; And then I agreed
        to that because I was the chair of the Committee on Professional Ethics,
        Miller was one of the members on the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics,
        and other people who were involved in the process where also on the Committee
        on Professional Ethics and we know that it would pass. The only problem
        was someone on the ACM said we need a grammarian to review it because
        he was upset with a particular split infinitive. And we said okay and
        took care of the one split infinitive that was identified. <br>
        It then went before the IEEE Computer Society and began... Leonard Trip
        had put them the same bind. &#8220;You are the IEEE Computer Society.
        Here is a code of ethics that has gone through your strongest procedure.
        What can you say about it?&#8221; And what happened is it was approved
        by the IEEE Computer Society with one caveat. They wanted their lawyer
        to review it to see if there was any legal problem with them supporting
        this code of ethics. And you&#8217;re going to go in my failed memory
        because yes, there was one sentence that required either a semicolon
        or something very trivial so that it wouldn&#8217;t be subject to a very
        perverse interpretation that the lawyer had. I&#8217;m sorry; my attitude
        is coming out there. It wouldn&#8217;t be subject to one of those alternate,
        possible interpretations you could give of what seemed like a clear sentence
        to everybody who voted on it. And it was interesting because it was one
        of those that received no objection. That being done I sent a letter
        to the IEEE Computer Society saying... No, I called Leonard and told
        him, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done,&#8221; and sent him the
        revised copy of the code, and he carried it through to the Computer Society
        and the code passed.</p>
      <p>And now we have a code for the IEEE Computer Society and the ACM. At
        this moment I develop a concern. I know the ACM charges people for copies
        of publications, charges people to do certain things, and I have this
        moment of panic and fear going, &#8220;Uh oh.&#8221; So I file a copyright
        registration on that code and pay my $20 out of my very own pocket for
        the copyright in the names of Rogerson, Miller, and Gotterbarn as copyright
        owners of the code. Then we have the next minor battle which is, since
        this code has been adapted, it&#8217;s time to print the final code.
        And time to print this final multiple-voted on version, multiply reviewed
        version in the Communications of the ACM and IEEE Computer Society. Calling
        each of them as I had done before saying, &#8220;There is no committee
        to say go ahead and get it published on...&#8221; Saying, &#8220;In accordance
        with my plan, back in February, not rejected by the committee, it&#8217;s
        time to publish.&#8221; <br>
        And I&#8217;m told, &#8220;Okay, well you have to fill out the copyright
        release forms.&#8221; </p>
      <p>And I say, &#8220;No I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s copyright and I want
        people to use it.&#8221; </p>
      <p>And you hear, &#8220;Well, this was a work for hire.&#8221; </p>
      <p>And I say, &#8220;Excuse me, a work for hire requires pay.&#8221; </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: You got no pay. Ha ha ha ha</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: And you go... And there&#8217;s some mumble, mumble, mumble. And
        then you call the IEEE Computer magazine and you get a similar kind of
        thing. And I say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the deal,&#8221; and I communicate
        with both of them, &#8220;I will sign the copyright,&#8221; I mean this
        is one of those really interesting things because I&#8217;m not sure
        if it&#8217;s legal. &#8220;I will sign the copyright over to both magazines,
        to be held jointly by the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society, provided
        that you put at the bottom of this document that this document may be
        reproduced entirely, can be reproduced in its entirety without cost or
        the need to request permission if this copyright, joint copyright ACM-IEEE,
        is included.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: That was your fear of the ACM charging, because otherwise they would
        charge...</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Otherwise they would charge... People who wanted to publish it in
        a book would have to pay to put it in a book. One of the easiest ways
        to get it distribute is to say, &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s for free!&#8221; </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: That right,</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: There was another thing and I guess we have to go back to the Baltimore
        meeting.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: The Baltimore hotel meeting?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: The Baltimore hotel meeting and I&#8217;m sorry to do this. One
        of the major decisions, and probably the most disgusting one is it at
        the Baltimore hotel meeting, I&#8217;m sorry my memory just popped up
        like this, was that several of the comments said the code was too long.
        To keep that whole thing in mind, it was too much. Well the code was
        structured with eight basic principles and clauses under each principle.
        So we said, &#8220;Well we could develop a short version of the code
        with just the principles.&#8221; So we re-worded some of the principles
        so that they could almost stand alone. And we built the code, changed
        the code so we put a short version in the front with a short preamble
        to the short version, the longer preamble, and the rest of it behind
        it. But the three of us were very anxious, and I guess the only real
        concern we had was as soon as you made a short version, someone would
        only pay attention to the short version. So the copyright notice says
        you can publish it with permission and without cost provided the code
        is published in its entirety. Also in the preamble of the short version,
        in the preamble of the short version it clearly points you to the longer
        discussion and says this preamble is just a reminder and pointer to the
        real issues. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: OK</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Both the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society accepted this thing.
        And that was another one of these things, I&#8217;m not sure of the legality
        of this and they questioned the legality of it but I know it&#8217;s
        been published in multiple textbooks and that it&#8217;s appeared in
        articles. And I think in part if you&#8217;re a publisher and someone
        says, &#8220;We published this code,&#8221; and the question is, &#8220;How
        much does it cost?&#8221; And the answer is zero. You don&#8217;t have
        to pay some book and everyone where it&#8217;s published. It&#8217;s
        easy to publish it. It&#8217;s easy to put up on your website. So that
        got accepted and the code got published. And that&#8217;s how the Software
        Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice came into existence
        with a million little side stories that I&#8217;ve left out. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Was there a certain moment in time where you thought, &#8220;Okay,
        this is it. This is time for a celebration.&#8221;?</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Oh, several of them, some of them mistaken. When we came back from
        Baltimore, euphoric is the best way to describe my attitude. It was, &#8220;We&#8217;ve
        done it right. We&#8217;ve met the objections. This is done exactly what
        I&#8217;ve hoped to happen from the beginning. And all the years of silliness
        from &#8217;93 to &#8217;96 until the world got rolling. It was okay.&#8221; And
        you&#8217;ve said you&#8217;ve met the deadline and you&#8217;ve done
        this. And then of course this elevation collapses as December and January
        goes by and you&#8217;re trying to contact these people and nobody is
        responding. And then it goes worse into the pit when you go through...
        That next year was a real downer because of all these comments coming
        in and you were never really... The IEEE vote worried me because any
        fickle thing, having made the mistake about &#8216;cultural diversity&#8217; in
        that first one and not realizing it you go... Because all it took was
        you to object to one clause in the code and you&#8217;re vote was not &#8220;I
        object to this clause&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;.
        If you objected to one clause and said &#8220;no&#8221; because of some
        stupid structure to it that we didn&#8217;t realize we were dead. </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: If ten people... If Person 1 objects to a Clause One, Person 2 objects
        to Clause 2 but only Clause two, Person 3 objects to Clause 3 but only
        Clause 3. Those all get registered as &#8220;no&#8221; votes? </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: That&#8217;s correct.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: So there&#8217;s a kind of big barrier against getting the body
        of it passed. </p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: The... Yes. And one of the things that deceptive is, I&#8217;ve
        forgotten what the number is whether we got 60, 70 or 80%, but when you
        see the number at first and you sit down and look at it and go, &#8220;That
        isn&#8217;t as impressive as the 90-some odd percent.&#8221; And then
        you look at the &#8220;no&#8221; vote is because of a particular wording
        in a particular clause and they loved the rest of it. And it&#8217;s
        a very steep hurdle to get over and when you get over it... It has the
        problem of when you look at the number and you go, &#8220;Oh, that isn&#8217;t
        the 90%, that&#8217;s 70%.&#8221; No, that&#8217;s 70% said every clause
        is perfect, 30% had some objection somewhere. </p>
      <p>So I guess after the December&#8217;s launched the code out, I sent
        out a celebration message and then the vote goes, &#8220;Uhhh.&#8221; And
        then you communicate with the guys again, with the people on the ethics
        taskforce again, at some point where it&#8217;s past the vote. &#8220;Hurray,
        we&#8217;ve made it,&#8221; but then you realize you haven&#8217;t gotten
        the committees, you haven&#8217;t gotten the ACM Council and the Board
        of Governors of the Computer Society saying, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: The Technical Standards Review, the way you described it, was a
        really powerful lever on both of those groups.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: Right.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: Especially I would say, especially pressing on the IEEE CS because
        this is their Technical Standards Review, but also that must have made
        it certain that the ACM couldn&#8217;t dismiss this as being a whatever.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: But you have to presume that rationality will prevail in the decision.
        And I won&#8217;t say anything about either of the committees, but sometimes
        things can go crazy for no reason at all. Some... We have had several
        companies that have adopted the code. They have them as conditions of
        employment where you read the code and sign it and say you&#8217;ll follow
        it. We have one company in Florida that was going to adopt the code until
        their lawyer looked at Clause 6 point something which says follow the
        laws of you&#8217;re whatever unless a significance issue of conscience
        arises that will hurt society or something like this. And that lawyer
        said, &#8220;We can&#8217;t accept the code because it says there can
        be occasion where you can violate the law and we&#8217;re a company and
        we can&#8217;t let you violate the law.&#8221; So they have their own
        version of the code that has everything except that particular clause.
        That&#8217;s all it takes.</p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: That would have been a &#8220;no&#8221; vote in the IEEE review,
        if it were the same structure.</p>
      <p><strong>DG</strong>: But I&#8217;m talking about on the council. I mean one of the things
        that got very awkward with the ACM Code at one point, this early code
        which finally got approved in &#8217;92. There was a meeting we had where
        we were discussing it in Dallas and someone from the ACM was at the meeting
        who was a lawyer or thought themselves a lawyer. And all of a sudden
        all sorts of things about liability the ACM would have if they approved
        this code, because it would be certifying that all ACM members followed
        this code. And you had to then deal with that because if that occurred
        at a council meeting and he convinced some people at council that that
        sort of position was a true legal issue, they would have worried about
        it and closed things down. So you never know what&#8217;s going to happen
        at any of these meetings. And I was not at the IEEE Computer Society
        one so you did not know what was going to happen. That got the code to
        be an official document. </p>
      <p>Now lessoned learned; keep people working, don&#8217;t step on political
        toes, and if it&#8217;s necessary there are some names of people who
        were on the taskforce on the Software Engineering Code of Ethics who
        probably did nothing except having their name there made it possible
        for it to get passed. So they contributed in a funny way whether they&#8217;d
        like to it or not. There&#8217;s if you can keep a good handle on all
        of the political issues, now I may have some allusions about what political
        issues were going on but by taking strategies to cover all of them if
        they were or weren&#8217;t going on they were addressed. And then given
        all this planning I&#8217;m sitting here talking about, the code wouldn&#8217;t
        be here if it weren&#8217;t for a set of mistakes. I&#8217;ve articulated
        what they are earlier. And it really is a strange process to look back
        on because you go, &#8220;Well I&#8217;m not a good politician. I&#8217;m
        in people&#8217;s faces all the time. And yet I managed to get this sucker
        through.&#8221; And how that happened is because the only smart thing
        I did was to select some good people; Rogerson and Miller and some of
        the others. And others emerged that I didn&#8217;t select. And I&#8217;m
        out of speed at the moment. You want to stop and we&#8217;ll think about
        what I should be talking about next? Or what you want to ask? </p>
      <p><strong>TM</strong>: yes.</p>
