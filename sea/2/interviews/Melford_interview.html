      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong>
<p>I have about 2 years of study at Cal State Northridge. I left school 
        to earn a living. I was studying economics. I have some formal education 
        in economics and some in programming. I am fully self-educated in systems 
        management as well as the business side of computing operations. I am 
        fully self-educated in networking, the technical aspects of networking, 
        as well as the ethics. One of my incentives for leaving school was that 
        I wasn&#8217;t able to get what I was after. At the time, there was basically 
        nothing available on computing security. I originally went in to study 
        electrical engineering, but found that that wasn&#8217;t quite my forte. 
        I came into computing in a backward sort of way. I read some issues of 
        Scientific American in the late &#8216;70s or early &#8216;80s. I believe 
        it was the September 1980 issue that was devoted to automation in the 
        workplace, and the following issue in October was dedicated to software 
        computing. Those two articles were extremely influential on me. They made 
        me think about automating the business workplace. During that time, I 
        had taken several courses in programming and management of information 
        systems (MIS). I found that I had a knack for it. I also took programming 
        classes that were oriented toward business majors, towards accounting 
        students. That was at Cal State Northridge. When I left school I decided 
        that I wanted to continue my education on my own. So I went and bought 
        a PDD11. Yes, that was the computer Digital Equipment Corporation then 
        made, the old deck PDD11, forerunner of the Vax. I mounted an early version 
        of UNIX on it, and started to go from there. That led into some consultant 
        work. I started my own consulting practice in 1984. I did consulting for 
        15-16 years. About 1999, I started with my current employer as chief information 
        officer. I focused on operational aspects of computing. That led into 
        concerns about reliability and quality of service, which led me into areas 
        of security. I spent a lot of time in security. Because of my business 
        background, I realized that this wasn&#8217;t just a technical issue; 
        it was also an issue of people, management, and behavior. In the late 
        80s, I was encouraged by a colleague to join IEEE and also IEEE&#8217;s 
        computer society (CS-IEEE). At some point, I got a mailing from the CS-IEEE 
        saying that they were starting up an ethics subcommittee and asking if 
        I was interested in participating. I said yes, and I was contacted by 
        Ralph Preiss. At that time he was the chairman of the Committee on Public 
        Policy (COPP). That was around the time of the Robert Morris, Jr., Internet 
        worm. Well, the computer society was asked to make a statement on this. 
        I think Ralph Preiss was the chair at the time. We wrote a position piece 
        on ethics. We also incorporated into our piece issues about viruses. I 
        think this was around 1989. The board of governors of CS-IEEE rejected 
        the statement we wrote in its entirety. And that was our first understanding 
        that those of us in the computing profession and engineering profession 
        by and large have a discomfort with dealing with soft issues, like ethics. 
        Trying to suggest that there is a common right way of behaving can be 
        controversial in a technical profession. They were very uncomfortable 
        about making such a public statement. I would later learn that this discomfort 
        was also very much a creature of the bureaucratic, or institutional, behavior 
        within the computer society and IEEE. In other words, if a certain issue 
        isn&#8217;t taken on by the board of governors, it will never progress 
        forward. That was also a learning experience. </p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p> I work for St. George Integrate Financial Solutions (IFS). It&#8217;s 
        a financial services company that was founded in 1999. It provides smaller 
        companies with the type of technical and professional resources and experiences 
        that are generally only available to very large institutions. The company&#8217;s 
        mission is to allow smaller financial institutions to compete on an even 
        playing field against the Bank of America, Citicorp, and American Express. 
        We provide the kind of technologies&#8212;like credit scoring and credit 
        analysis&#8212;that are available in a highly automated environment at 
        large institutions but that smaller institutions must still do with pencil 
        and paper or at best a spread sheet, with a person or a group of people 
        making a judgmental decision. We also provide credit checks, consulting 
        and marketing services, and things like that. I am the chief information 
        officer. I am responsible for the day-to-day operations of our corporate 
        computing environment. We have five offices that are linked together by 
        virtual private networks. </p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, I have a lot of experience with software development. During the 
        course of my years as a consultant, which ran from 84-99, the main goal 
        of the consulting practice was systems integration. I partnered with a 
        colleague in 1997 to develop a program for data mining for banks. The 
        program was designed to help banks determine the amount of profit that 
        customers generate for the bank. The program is called Wallet Share. This 
        program is actually how I got my current job at St. George; the company 
        had taken notice of what we had done.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p>Not officially. I&#8217;m not licensed and I don&#8217;t have a degree. 
        But most people would consider me to be an engineer. I think most of my 
        colleagues view me as such. I certainly identify with that side of my 
        field, probably more than anything else other than general business. I 
        am an engineer in the sense that I determine how technology can be applied 
        in a cohesive and complimentary manner to solve problems. </p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p> There is a long and a short answer to your question. The long answer 
        involves telling you how the committee came into being in the first place. 
        The short answer is that I was the chairman at the time of the committee 
        on public policy for the computer society. And, because I had some significant 
        positions (related to ethics and computing) in the computer society, I 
        was asked if I would assist in starting up the ethics side. I heard about 
        the project because I was already involved in the computer society. </p>
      <p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p>I was interested in the subject of ethics. Because I came to computing 
        from a business background, I understood that it&#8217;s how people apply 
        technology (how they use it) that matters. I was brought into the team 
        for two reasons: First, I was chairing the committee on public policy 
        at the time. I was the natural bureaucratic person to assign to it. Second, 
        I had written and spoken on ethics, and my CV was known to the computer 
        society&#8217;s board of governors. I agreed to co-chair SEEPP because 
        I was interested in it and I was the obvious choice because of my experience. 
        I don&#8217;t think anyone gets involved in ethics unless they are interested 
        in it. I know that&#8217;s why I got involved.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> I was modestly familiar with codes of ethics. I had spent a fair amount 
        of time researching and learning about the IEEE code&#8212;and the ACM 
        code. I had looked at codes of medical ethics. I&#8217;ve studied the 
        bar association&#8217;s code of ethics. The latter was part of my general 
        research and learning in computer security. I wrote several papers, and 
        had to do some background research in understanding that. </p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p>Well, I didn&#8217;t participate in preparing the code itself. Because 
        Don Gotterbarn and I were the two founding chairs of SEEPP, my main participation 
        was in setting up this agenda, recruiting people to the committee, and 
        laying out our work agendas. I spent a lot of time doing the back room 
        politics. I spent a lot of time with my colleagues from the IEEE leadership 
        assuring them that we were not going to reinvent the IEEE code of ethics. 
        I spent a lot of time within the computer society assuring the computer 
        society board of governors that we were not going to make public statements 
        that might embarrass the computer society. I spent a lot of time basically 
        putting out fires. I played the classic middle manager role by keeping 
        all of the nonsense away from people who were trying to get the work done. 
        I had to discontinue my involvement in late 96, early 97, because my own 
        work had gotten too crazy. </p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p>As with any team, we met face-to-face, on the phone, and by e-mail. The 
        team consisted of Pat Sullivan, Michael McFarland, and Ramon Barquin (one 
        of the founders of the Computer Ethics Institute). We met in a number 
        of locations. We met at computer society headquarters at least once (Washington, 
        DC), if not several times. We met at BU [Boston University] at least once 
        during my tenure. And at that point McFarland had us go back to the committee. 
        I know I met with Professor Susie Wiseman [Weisband?] at the University 
        of Arizona. I don&#8217;t remember if we had the whole team out at U of 
        A. We might have, but I don&#8217;t recall. </p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p>Face-to-face meetings were critical. At least during my tenure, we hardly 
        ever got work done otherwise. When we met face-to-face, we got a lot of 
        stuff done. </p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p>The first meeting at the computer society headquarters. That was very 
        productive meeting. Don, Susie, McFarland, and Fletcher Buckley were there. 
        And our attorney was there. He was based out of New Jersey. Elliott Chikofsky 
        was there. He didn&#8217;t participate in SEEPP, but he was one of the 
        speakers. Steve Barber was the name of the lawyer.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant to 
        your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, lots. I will check. What I want to do is go back and look through 
        what I have here [in the file he was holding], make sure it&#8217;s not 
        something that I really want to have confidential, and then all I would 
        want to know is if I release it to you, I&#8217;d be able to have access 
        to it. </p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p>They&#8217;re easier to write than practice statements. A code of ethics 
        also makes it simpler when you&#8217;re starting to write practice statements. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p> That&#8217;s a chicken-or-egg question; so, I&#8217;ll give you a chicken-or-egg 
        answer. A code doesn&#8217;t have any importance if people don&#8217;t 
        understand it, think about it, and apply it. The main importance is to 
        clarify thinking and raise awareness. Awareness of a problem is always 
        required before you can solve it. </p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p>I&#8217;m thrilled that I had a chance to participate in something that 
        I think was pretty important. I&#8217;m displeased that just when things 
        were starting to get interesting, I had to pull out. And I had to pull 
        out just because my regular work didn&#8217;t allow me the time to continue. 
        That was disappointing. I felt like I let the team down. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p>I was happy, and am happy, with the code. I think it&#8217;s a well-thought-out 
        document. I didn&#8217;t find any gaps that should have been addressed. 
        There&#8217;s no item or aspect of the code that I think could have been 
        better. So I can&#8217;t give an affirmation about that. </p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p>Obviously Don. Michael McFarland and Ramon Barquin were also very influential 
        on me. Pat Sullivan was also very helpful. But Don has done the yeoman&#8217;s 
        work. Without Don, nothing would have been done. Without Fletcher Buckley, 
        the person who originally kicked things off, it would have taken a lot 
        longer for any of this to get going. Fletcher was great, though. </p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p>Add to the names in 17, the following: Ron Anderson, Vanderbilt University; 
        Albert Howard; and Fiorenza&#8230;.(*It&#8217;s probably best for Melford 
        to provide the other names to you with their correct spelling&#8212;TS.) 
      </p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p>Since I was in charge of the process, let me change the question. If 
        I had been in charge of the process that was in charge of SEEPP itself, 
        what would I have done differently? If I had access to greater funds, 
        I would have made it much easier to bring the teams face-to-face to work 
        on things. If we could have had more face-to-face meetings that were closer 
        together, less time in between, we would have progressed much further, 
        much farther, much more quickly. I would also have put more effort into 
        addressing all of the folks who did not want to deal with the soft issues 
        and who were concerned that the committee would embarrass them. </p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said?</strong> </p>
      <p> It would be interesting to discuss personal dynamics that went on in 
        the deliberations. Certainly, much of what we accomplished was influenced 
        by the kinds of personalities involved. Our motivations, our working together, 
        so on. </p>
