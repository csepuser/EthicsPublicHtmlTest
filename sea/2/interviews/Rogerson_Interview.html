      <p> <strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>I have a BSc (bachelor of science) in computer
        science from the University of Dundee (1972). After that I worked in
        industry
        for twelve years. I 
        worked at various levels on scientific and commercial management systems&#8212;until
         my division was moved someplace I did not want to live. I ended up as
        
        _____________ at ___________________. [please fill in]</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>In 1983, I became a lecturer at (what was then) Leicester Polytechnic 
        (which became De Montfort University a few years later). The government 
        was then trying to bring into technical universities people who had industrial 
        experience. I have been teaching here ever since, adding more courses 
        that are application-oriented. But I have maintained links to industry 
        by consulting. I am now president of the Institute for Management Information 
        Systems (IMIS). I am also Director of the Centre for Computer and Social 
        Responsibility here at De Montfort.</p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>I&#8217;ve been involved in building a number of business systems.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>No, nor even a software engineer. In the UK, the standard job titles 
        are &#8220;applications programmer&#8221;, &#8220;systems analyst&#8221;, 
        and &#8220;information systems programmers&#8221;. Computer scientists 
        are interested in the science of computing rather than the application. 
        In the UK, software engineers are interested in building robust systems 
        according to engineering principles. They are more technically oriented 
        than I am. (I think the same is true in the rest of Northern Europe, though 
        perhaps not in France.) If I had grown up in the US, I might answer differently. 
        I&#8217;m an applications person&#8212;and, in the US, someone who works 
        on applications is a software engineer even if he is, as I am, more interested 
        in the way people and programs react than in the technical qualities of 
        the applications.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task Force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>On 19 October 1994, I received a broadcast email from Don Gotterbarn 
        (sent through the Computer Ethics Institute list, to which I belonged). 
        I&#8217;ll give you a copy. I sent in a filled out form the next day. 
        I did not hear much from Don after that until 1996.</p>
      <p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong> 
      </p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>I&#8217;ve been interested in systems failure for a long time. Asking 
        why systems fail led to conclude that the root cause was often that the 
        programmers were so preoccupied with applications that they failed to 
        take account of the people who would use the system or might in some way 
        become its victim. That led me to think about ethics and the social impact 
        of computing. I responded to Don&#8217;s email because I had concluded 
        on my own that a code of ethics might help shape the culture in which 
        programmers work, making them less likely to forget those who use or otherwise 
        rely on software. I also responded because I thought both the IEEE and 
        the ACM clearly have a US bias. I thought the process would benefit from 
        some European input. Then, in Feb 1996, I heard Don make a presentation 
        at a conference at Westminster University. I could see that both Don and 
        I were grappling with problems of creating the proper culture for good 
        programming. I invited Don to spend a semester at De Montfort. He accepted, 
        beginning his visit in Jan. 1997.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>Yes, several years before I heard from Don, I had started to look at 
        codes as part of professionalism modules in my courses. Teaching professional 
        practice seemed a good way to change programmers&#8217; behaviour; teaching 
        codes seemed a good way to teach professionalism. Codes seemed a good 
        management tool, a way to structure team dynamics. I had read the BCS 
        code (British Computing Society) and the ACM&#8217;s.</p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>After Don arrived in Jan. 1997, and until late February, we sat down 
        periodically to work through Version 1. I tried to eliminate language 
        that made the code too parochial. We also wanted the code to make it clear 
        that the profession included both teachers of software engineering and 
        managers of software engineers. We worked under considerable time pressure. 
        As I recall, the IEEE had set a deadline. The whole project might have 
        fallen through had we not got Version 2 to the Joint Steering Committee 
        in time. After we met the deadline, the Steering Committee reorganized 
        the task force. Don became the sole chair (instead of co-chair with Bob 
        Melford). Don, Keith Miller, and I became SEEPP&#8217;s executive committee. 
        We had a lot of face-to-face meetings (in Leicester) that term, many of 
        them developing strategies to get the code through the IEEE or ACM procedures. 
        The procedures of both these organizations are much more democratic than 
        those of the BCS. The UK just imposed its code on British software engineers. 
        They did not, as the US organizations eventually did, bring in the membership 
        by giving them a direct voice. The US approach, though more time consuming, 
        seems to me more likely to succeed in winning over the membership.<br>
        One other thing. There were two significant meetings between Don, Keith, 
        and me. One was in Baltimore, Dec. 97. It was then that the three of us 
        created Version 3&#8217;s structure of key words and short code at front. 
        It was clear to me that each of us brought different things to the meeting. 
        Two days, non-stop. Long discussions of particular words and phrases. 
        We tried to make the code&#8217;s text as independent of local culture 
        as we could. For example,-------------[fill in!].<br>
        The other meeting was at Dartmouth, NH, August 1998, in a shack in the 
        woods (drinking beer and eating bananas), again for two days&#8212;during 
        the Tangleweb Conference. We (Don, Keith, and I) had received more than 
        a hundred responses to Version 4. According to IEEE procedure, we had 
        to review and respond to every one. By the time we left, we had version 
        5. All decisions had been unanimous. Some responses were against the very 
        idea of a code. Some responses were to the effect that the rules were 
        hard to follow. We responded that you had to put those hard rules in or 
        all you would get would be the bad practices we have now.</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or by face-to-face meetings, or by letter, or by 
        information conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>Mostly face to face (as described above) or by email. There may have 
        been an occasional phone conversation with Keith Miller.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>Without doubt, the fact-to-face sessions were rich. With Don over here, 
        I was able to change radically the positioning of the code (making it 
        more international).</p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better?) </strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>The face-to-face meetings in Leicester, Jan-Feb 1997, in Baltimore, and 
        at Dartmouth, as I explained earlier.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have documents, paper or electronic, relevant to your 
        participation in the process? May we have a copy? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>Yes, I have a lot. I will send.</p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>I am now more convinced that codes have a role to play in making computer 
        programs better. Of course, that role requires that codes be used pro-actively. 
        A &#8220;bookend code&#8221;, one that just sits on the shelf, won&#8217;t 
        do much. The code must be &#8220;dog eared&#8221;, that is, constantly 
        used in decision-making. One effect of working on the Software Engineering 
        Code is that my center has had a part in developing two others, one for 
        IMIS and one for BCS (a code of ethics and a code of practice). Working 
        in SEEPP confirmed a lot of ideas I already had and made me more aware 
        of ways to use codes. See the SE code&#8217;s Preamble for that list of 
        ways to use the code. I have also become more concerned about putting 
        ethics into practice. We have a code; so, what now?</p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>There are at least four ways codes are important. First, they set a benchmark, 
        especially for someone new to the field. This is what is expected. Second, 
        they provide a framework when there is a claim of unprofessional practice. 
        Here is what we think you did wrong. Third, a code also protects members 
        of a profession because it provides a basis of defense. Nothing in the 
        code forbids this. Why then do you think it is unprofessional? Fourth, 
        a code provides a mechanism for assuring the user that work will be done 
        as well as possible and that, when there are problems (as there always 
        will be) users will be kept informed. The most important part of a code 
        is the part that helps you respond properly when something goes wrong.</p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>I&#8217;m pleased to have made what I think was a significant contribution 
        to making the SE code an international code. I&#8217;m also pleased with 
        the translations (e.g. into Chinese). It&#8217;s been interesting helping 
        translators get the spirit of the English when there was no way to get 
        the letter. </p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>I think it&#8217;s a shame that it took so long to get started. But I 
        suppose that couldn&#8217;t be helped. I&#8217;m especially pleased with 
        the structure, the hierarchy of rules and principles, the eight broad 
        areas. I am pleased too with the way the code brings out the tension between 
        serving the public, serving the client, and doing a good job on the product.</p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>Don [Gotterbarn] of course, and Keith Miller. Ben Fairweather and Mary 
        Prior. And Ed Mechler, because he saved the process at a crucial point.</p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain. 
        </strong></p>
      <p>Same as in 17.</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>Can&#8217;t think of anything&#8212;given the environment in which the 
        process had to go on. Don came up with a plan and set realistic goals.</p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>SR: </strong>No.</p>
