      <p><strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> B.A. in philosophy (SUNY-Albany, NY - 1973). Ph.D.
        in philosophy (Washington University, St. Louis, MO -1986). Post-doc/Masters
        in Technology of Education
        (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA - 1997) </p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do there?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> I am the President of Interactive Learning Technologies
        (a company that I started in 1997). ILT leverages various technologies
        to create educational
        programs for schools and businesses. Since 1986, I have been Executive
        Director of a not-for-profit company, Education Media Resources. In both
        organizations, I produce, direct, and oversee the creation of interactive
        educational multimedia programs. </p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? If
        you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>JF:</strong> I&#8217;ve created a number of interactive
                      educational CDs. The first ones were in the field of computer
                      ethics. I did the software coding, as well as
  interface design for many of these programs. I became a software developer,
  because I saw the enormous potential computing technology has for educating
  people.<br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> No. I am first and foremost a philosopher, focusing
        on issues in applied ethics. I am particularly interested in computer,
        information, and technology
        ethics.</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> Don Gotterbarn called the task force to my attention.
        I&#8217;ve worked
        with Don since 1991 when he was a featured speaker at the National Conference
        on Computing and Human Values. The conference was underwritten by the
        National Science Foundation. It brought together many important thinkers
        in the field of computer ethics including: John Perry Barlow, Dorothy
        Denning, Don Gotterbarn, Walter Maner, Dianne Martin, Keith Miller, Deborah
        Johnson, Donn Parker, Judy Perrolle, Willis Ware, and Joseph Weizenbaum.
        This conference was important in the history of computer ethics since
        it brought together individuals representing various perspectives in
        the field. </p>
      <p><strong>6. What led you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> My interest in computer ethics was already strong,
        while working at the Research Center on Computing and Society. The Center
        had produced
        monographs and later -- with the assistance of Educational Media Resources
        -- a series of videos in the field of computer ethics. So it was a logical
        step to participate in SEEPP. Mind you, however, my involvement, as noted
        below, was very minimal.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> Absolutely. We had been working with various codes
        of ethics at RCCS (see 5 above). We were familiar with all of the existing
        professional
        codes: IEEE&#8217;s, ACM&#8217;s, and ABET&#8217;s. Our focus at the
        Center was to find ways of implementing computer ethics in curricula. </p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong><br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>JF:</strong> Very little. I was on the early email
                      list for a while, and commented on some of the issues that
                      were discussed. </p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter,
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> Email mostly. A few phone conversations with Don.
        I&#8217;m not sure
        how much of these phone conversation were related to SEEPP and how much
        they were related to the Center&#8217;s work. These conversations took
        place been 1991-1993, occasioned by the NCCS [National Conference on
        Computers and Society]. We also crossed paths at various conferences.
        I recollect Don saying (when handing out a leaflet about SEEPP): &#8220;Here.
        This is what we talked about.&#8221; My participation was over by the
        end of 1993.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better than
        the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as best?
        Why?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> We had a VAX system. I did not find it particularly
        useful for email &#8211; when
        I compare it to today&#8217;s email programs. The phone was definitely
        a better way to communicate then (1991-1993). Fortunately, email has
        improved. </p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant to the
        process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> Nothing springs to mind.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant to your
        participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> Yes, I had lots of electronic documents; I am a
        notorious pac-rat. I should have some materials backed up. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result
      of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> Yes. I see first hand the practical, difficult,
        and bureaucratic process of creating a code of ethics that members of
        a large organization adopt. </p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of ethics?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>JF:</strong> A code of ethics is essential for any given profession.
        In many ways, it defines a profession, and distinguishes it from a group
        of people
        sharing common interests or performing similar activities. It also adds &#8220;gravitas&#8221; to
        a group. Consequently, it is not surprising to find codes of ethics in
        various professions, like medicine, law, accounting, and more. </p>
      <p>While these codes do not necessarily make practitioners of a profession
        moral and ethical; they do set up clear guidelines for behavior (those
        that allowed, and those that are not). By having such codes, members
        of a profession can measure their actions easily. An important derivative
        of such codes, is the sense of safety and reliability that is engendered
        in the public. </p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>JF:</strong> I wish I had more time to participate.</p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> While I think the code of ethics generated by SEEPP
        is a step in the right direction, I do disagree with a basic premise
        in the formulation
        of the code. SEEPP makes a point of not wanting to be thought of as an
        algorithm for solving ethical conundrums. In an ideal world, were individuals
        are comfortable in making moral decisions this approach would work. However,
        based on my research, I have found that most computer professionals are
        not very comfortable in making moral decisions. Moral decision making
        has not been, for the most part, a part of their formal educational training.
        Consequently, I believe that an algorithmic approach would work better
        for software engineers. I think some guiding principles attached to a
        database of cases (updated regularly) would be the best way to encourage
        computer professionals to consult the code on a regular basis.</p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems to you
        especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>JF:</strong> Don Gotterbarn! I don&#8217;t think the code of
        ethics would have seen the light of day were it not for his tireless
        work. Keith Miller is also
        someone who has evangelized the cause from its infancy. </p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> There are others in the history of computer/technology
        ethics who have, in my opinion, laid the foundation for SEEPP. These
        include: Donn Parker,
        Willis Ware, Joseph Weizenbaum, Dorothy Denning and Peter Denning.</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, would
        you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> If I had been in charge, I would have steered the
        code along the lines I describe above (question 16). Additionally, I
        would have worked on
        various ways of educating the members. Creating the code is a first step
        towards ethical awareness; the next step is to make sure all members
        understand the code and can work with the code in their daily practise.</p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t?
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said? </strong></p>
      <p><strong>JF:</strong> Nothing that comes to mind now.</p>
