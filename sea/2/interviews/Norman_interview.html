      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" -->     <p><strong>1. What is your educational background?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MN: </strong>(Summary) B.Sc (Bachelor of Science) in Mathematics
        (Univeristy of London, 1972), an &#8220;external decree&#8221; he took
        while working full time at the University of Hull (east of York). He
        started out
         as 
        a computer technician, moved on to programming, then user consulting
         (help  faculty and grad assistants write programs and make them work).
         Before 
        taking the job at Hull, he had been in the Royal Air Force, 1958-65,
         serving  on the ground crew. He regarded the job at Hull as &#8220;as
         far from  working on air planes as I could get&#8221;. Norman is in
         his early 70s.  [Did you do anything after high school but before RAF?]</p>
      <p><strong>2. What sort of organization do you work for? What do you do 
        there?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN: </strong>(Summary) Norman&#8217;s father, a British diplomat,
        met his mother in Cuba. (She was a Cuban whose parents had come from
        Germany.)
        
        His parents and brothers all moved to Los Angeles in the early 1960s
        (?).  He wanted to move there too, but the closest he could come, after
        much 
        looking, was Eastern Michigan University, where in 1979 he found a job
         similar to the one he had had at Hull. He provides computer support
        and 
        faculty liaison. He also teaches one or two courses a year in Computer
         Science, for example, Computer Architecture. He used to do systems administration.</p>
      <p><strong>3. What experience, if any, have you had in software development? 
        If you are a software developer, what led you into that field?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MN: </strong>(Summary) He has been writing programs since the 1960s. Some
         of the early programs were &#8220;drum plotters&#8221; for Hull&#8217;s
          geology or physics department. &#8220;I preferred writing programs&#8212;well
           designing them. Because I began writing them so long ago, I have a
          sense 
        of the machinery on which they must run, the way the machines and the
           programs will interact.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>4. Are you an engineer?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;Well, only insofar as a &#8216;software engineer&#8217; 
        is an engineer; so, not really.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>5. How did you hear about the IEEE/ACM Joint Task force on Software 
        Engineering and Professional Practice (SEEPP)?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;I first heard about the IEEE when I had to 
        teach its new standards for floating point calculations. That was about 
        1978. I had been a member of the British Computer Society since the late 
        1960s. [something to do with ALGOL, an ancestor of C]. I joined the ACM 
        soon after arriving in the US, becoming an officer (treasurer, data base 
        manager, chair) in the Ann Arbor chapter. I don&#8217;t remember how I 
        first heard about the Joint Task Force, but it seems probable that it 
        was through that ACM chapter. Don [Gotterbarn] spoke to the chapter in 
        late 1993. I think he mentioned codes of ethics in the talk. I approached 
        him after the talk and said I was interested.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>6. What lead you to participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always had an interest in being 
        professional. I have my own code of ethics. I thought I&#8217;d like to 
        help put something together for everyone like me.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>7. Were you familiar with codes of ethics before you became involved 
        in SEEPP? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;No, I was not. In fact, I thought the ACM 
        needed a code. I didn&#8217;t know it already had one. But I knew lawyers 
        and accountants have a code of ethics and I thought, &#8216;We&#8217;re 
        the same sort of pepole; we should have one too&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>8. In what ways did you participate in SEEPP&#8217;s work, especially 
        in the process of preparing the code? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;Don came up with a list of codes to look 
        at. I chose to research the CPA Code of Ethics. I took out some books 
        from the library, put together a list of ideas I found in that code, and 
        sent it to the [profcomp] list. That was about it.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>9. By what means did you participate? For example, did you participate 
        by email, or by phone, or through face-to-face meetings, or by letter, 
        or by informal conversation, or the like?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;Emails&#8212;practically all.&#8221; After 
        some further questioning he explained the hedge. &#8220;I never met any 
        of the people involved&#8212;except Don and that was before; there may 
        have been a phone call or fax here or there but I don&#8217;t recall any. 
        Email was just about it. Maybe it was all there was.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Did any of these means of participation seem to work better 
        than the others? Any seem to work worse? Which would you recommend as 
        best? Why?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>Nothing to add here.</p>
      <p><strong>11. Any events that particularly stick in your mind relevant 
        to the process? (The more details, the better.)</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>The time I met Don at the ACM meeting is one. The 
        only other event I recall is the silence, a year or more, when nothing 
        seemed to be happening with the codes project.</p>
      <p><strong>12. Do you have any documents, paper or electronic, relevant 
        to your participation in the process? May we have a copy?</strong><br>
        <br>
        <strong>MN:</strong>He made a CD with all emails he had.</p>
      <p><strong>13. Has your thinking about codes of ethics changed as a result 
        of your participation in SEEPP&#8217;s work? How?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know of any change. Well, I 
        did come to think of a code of ethics as something more than &#8216;a 
        boy scout&#8217;s honor code&#8217;. It&#8217;s more like a constitution 
        or set of rules. I&#8217;d never looked into codes before the project. 
        I used to think &#8216;just be honest with the customer&#8217;. I thought 
        a code was oriented more to the public consultant and his client.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>14. What, in your opinion, is important about having a code of 
        ethics?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t abide by the code of ethics, 
        you&#8217;ll get kicked out. The code should instill trust by displaying 
        discipline. A sense of professionalism should be almost like a religion.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>15. Is there anything about your participation that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;Yes, that they adopted some ideas from the 
        CPA code (as I modified them to fit software engineers).&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>16. Is there anything about the final code that you are especially 
        pleased with or unhappy about?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m pleased we came up with a 
        final code and that it was published in the ACM&#8217;s Communications.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>17. Is there anyone whose participation in the process seems 
        to you especially important? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;Ed Mechler, particularly. He took over a 
        lot of dirty work. He did a great job.&#8212;And, Don, of course.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>18. Anyone who you think we should be sure to talk to? Explain.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;Mechler. Don, of course.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>19. If you had been in charge of the process, what, if anything, 
        would you have done differently?</strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;Well, to begin with, I&#8217;d have learned 
        a lot more about the process. Right now, given what I do know, I have 
        no idea whether anything could have been done better.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong>20. Is there anything we should have asked but didn&#8217;t? 
        Anything you want to add to what you have already said? </strong></p>
      <p> <strong>MN:</strong>&#8220;I might have had something to say some years 
        ago. But not now. It was all so long ago. I was certainly happy with the 
        whole thing. Nothing stands out as &#8216;really good&#8217;&#8212;except 
        that code itself. It&#8217;s a really good code. Wording is very important, 
        especially if you&#8217;re going to sit in judgment on your colleagues 
        using the code as a standard. You don&#8217;t want people getting away 
        with things on a technicality.&#8221;</p>  <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
