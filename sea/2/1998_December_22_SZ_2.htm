                   <p>This is along message. Items that require action on your
                     part are preceded by the symbol &quot;&raquo;&quot;.</p>
                   <p>We are happy to report that the ACM and the IEEE?Computer 
 
                     Society have approved, at their respective Fall board meetings, 
 
                     a replacement structure for the Joint committee and its task 
 
                     forces. Effective January 1, 1999, the Joint Committee and 
 
                     its task forces are dissolved and, in their place, there will 
 
                     be a new entity called the Software Engineering Coordinating 
 
                     Committee (SWECC), and a corresponding set of projects. </p>
 
                   <p>&raquo; 1) Please pass this information on to your respective 
 
                     task force members. You may just want to forward this message.</p>
 
                   <p> &raquo; 2) Please provide us a list of your task force members 
 
                     so we can request that their respective societies acknowledge 
 
                     their work in an appropriate fashion.</p>
 
                   <p>SWECC consists of a chair (Leonard, representing the CS BOG), 
 
                     vice chair (Dennis, representing the ACM Council and EC), 
 
                     and two other representatives from each society. The ACM representatives 
 
                     are Mark Ardis (representing SIGSOFT and the technical community) 
 
                     and Linda Northrop (representing the Education board and the 
 
                     education community). CS representatives are Karl Reed (representing 
 
                     TCSE and the technical community) and Doris Carver (representing 
 
                     the Education Activities board and the education community). 
 
                     Both the ACM Council and the Computer Society Board of Governors 
 
                     have expressed a strong interest in knowing about the activities 
 
                     of SWECC and its projects.</p>
 
                   <p>SWECC is jointly owned by the two societies and it will function<br>
 
                     In several roles. Among them are:</p>
 
                   <p><u>Coordination of related activities</u>: We are establishing 
 
                     liaisons with many activities related to the body of knowledge, 
 
                     accreditation, curriculum, licensing, certification and such.</p>
 
                   <p><u>Communication</u>: About activities related to the software 
 
                     engineering profession. Among other things, we are creating 
 
                     a web page that will describe the activities of SWEEP and 
 
                     its projects and will have pointers to other activities related 
 
                     to establishing software engineering as a profession. A forum 
 
                     for public discussion is one possible feature. You are welcome 
 
                     to suggest items to be included or pointed to by this web 
 
                     page.</p>
 
                   <p><u>Projects</u>: Instead of task forces, SWEEP will operate 
 
                     through a series of projects, for which it will provide sponsorship 
 
                     and oversight. Each project will have a concrete goal and 
 
                     a defined duration. The bylaws of SWEEP, as approved by the 
 
                     two societies, call for each project to be proposed to and 
 
                     approved by SWEEP, with follow?on approval by each society. 
 
                     Each project is to have its own financial sponsorship and 
 
                     governing structure, reporting to SWEEP. Each project's management 
 
                     structure will include an appointee from each society, who 
 
                     will report to his or her society on a regular basis.</p>
 
                   <p>The body of knowledge project, which has been sponsored for 
 
                     the past year by the Computer Society, will be presented to 
 
                     the ACM for approval in about two months. The projects from 
 
                     the education and ethics areas are expected to follow, later 
 
                     in the year.</p>
 
                   <p><u>Transition</u>: By design, the project structure offers 
 
                     a relatively straightforward transition from the current task 
 
                     force structure. The main differences are a different funding 
 
                     structure and a revised governance structure that should provide 
 
                     more overall coordination among related activities and more 
 
                     communication to the professionals and, indeed, to the interested 
 
                     public. For example, the Texas Board of Professional Engineers 
 
                     and the new chair of SCAB have both requested to be kept involved 
 
                     in and aware of these activities, and both are planning to 
 
                     make use of the results of our work.</p>
 
                   <p>Our intent as chair and vice-chair of SWECC is to transform 
 
                     the current task force activities into projects under SWECC. 
 
                     We intend to retain the key individuals from each task force 
 
                     and to provide a mechanism by which their activities can achieve 
 
                     more impact. To that end,</p>
 
                   <p> &raquo; 3) we are requesting that you, as leaders of the 
 
                     current task forces, prepare project proposals to be reviewed 
 
                     by SWECC. Further details for each of your areas can be discussed 
 
                     separately, although some general guidelines are listed below.</p>
 
                   <p>SWECC plans to meet twice a year in person (winter and summer) 
 
                     and regularly between such meetings by email and/or web forums. 
 
                     Thus, proposals that you prepare can be discussed informally 
 
                     with us in an electronic fashion and can even be approved 
 
                     and forwarded to the sponsoring societies in that fashion. 
 
                     The first meeting of SWECC will occur on January 28 and 29, 
 
                     1999 in Austin, Texas. The primary purpose of this meeting 
 
                     will be to organize SWECC, so we do not expect to hear full 
 
                     reports or full proposals from your task forces. However we 
 
                     would like to hear an abbreviated report from each task force 
 
                     (it need not be in person, since agenda time will be slim). 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 4) Please prepare a brief report summarizing past 
 
                     activities and future project plans, including strategies 
 
                     to be used for achieving your objectives. Note that several 
 
                     members of SWECC have not participated in previous activities 
 
                     and will benefit from having a brief historical overview. 
 
                     Please submit this report electronically. If you have a representative 
 
                     who resides in the area (for example, Laurie Werth of the 
 
                     education activity resides in Austin), we could meet with 
 
                     them briefly on the afternoon of the 28th to discuss your 
 
                     report, but the small amount of time we expect to have would 
 
                     not justify long distance travel just for this purpose.</p>
 
                   <p>Code of Ethics and Professional Practice: Both societies 
 
                     have approved the code of ethics, so our understanding is 
 
                     that the primary objective of a project at this point will 
 
                     be to maintain this code and to evolve it as more professional 
 
                     practice elements can be established.</p>
 
                   <p><u>Education</u>: The education boards of both societies 
 
                     have endorsed your proposed accreditation criteria and we 
 
                     understand that CSAB/ABET will make use of these as it develops 
 
                     detailed procedures for accreditation of software engineering 
 
                     programs. We would like a proposal for an education project 
 
                     that addresses curriculum matters, and we encourage you to 
 
                     consider some kind of joint activity with the Working Group 
 
                     for Software Engineering Education, chaired by Nancy Mead 
 
                     of SEI and Tom Hilburn of ERAU, whose work seems to dovetail 
 
                     well with your own. For example, David Parnas has recently 
 
                     suggested a workshop on software engineering curriculum issues 
 
                     that would be jointly organized by your activity, the working 
 
                     group, and possibly others working in that area. This is the 
 
                     kind of activity that SWECC would support. (Dennis Frailey 
 
                     discussed this and other ideas with Don Bagert of the Working 
 
                     Group, Laurie Werth of the Education Task Force, and David 
 
                     Parnas when Parnas recently visited the University of Texas 
 
                     and the Texas Board of Professional Engineers.)</p>
 
                   <p><u>Proposals</u>: Proposals, need to address the following 
 
                     issues in order to satisfy the requirements of the two societies: 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>- summary of the project's goals and objectives </p>
 
                   <p>-the expected duration of the project </p>
 
                   <p>- the expected outcome / deliverables of the project </p>
 
                   <p>-the planned process for achieving the desired results </p>
 
                   <p>-expected intermediate milestones and proposed reporting 
 
                     dates (to SWECC and the societies) </p>
 
                   <p>- the proposed management and governance structure, including 
 
                     names of key individuals involved </p>
 
                   <p>- a budget that shows the total cost for the project, and 
 
                     how the money will be spent each year. </p>
 
                   <p>- an indication of where the money will come from and in 
 
                     what fiscal years it will be needed.</p>
 
                   <p><u>Funding</u>: </p>
 
                   <p>- SWECC will not have significant funds for direct project 
 
                     support. However because of its oversight and sponsorship 
 
                     role, each project will provide a financial report to SWECC 
 
                     on an annual basis. The SWECC fiscal year runs from July 1 
 
                     through June 30, thus financial reports will be due at its 
 
                     summer meeting. -for relatively small projects (roughly, under 
 
                     $10K/year), it is likely that each society or its sub?units 
 
                     would provide the funding, although this is not a requirement. 
 
                     For example, an education project might solicit funds from 
 
                     the respective education boards or corresponding special interest 
 
                     groups or technical committees for larger projects, sponsorship 
 
                     should be solicited from such sources as:<br>
 
                     - society SIGs or TCs </p>
 
                   <p>-government funding agencies such as NSF or NIST</p>
 
                   <p>- business and industry sources To illustrate, the BOK project 
 
                     will have roughly 10% of its budget covered by each of the 
 
                     societies and the remainder from industry and government sources</p>
 
                   <p><u>Management and Governance</u>:<br>
 
                     - SWECC will normally expect to review annual progress reports 
 
                     from each project at its Winter meeting and to see intermediate 
 
                     progress electronically at appropriate milestones. Another 
 
                     option for a major project is a special review event.<br>
 
                     - The management of each project will vary, depending on the 
 
                     size. At a minimum, there should be at least two individuals, 
 
                     one from each society, who manage the project and whose duties 
 
                     include reporting to their respective society about project 
 
                     status and progress. One of these individuals should also 
 
                     report regularly to SWECC, as previously described.<br>
 
                     - larger projects that solicit funds from industry and other 
 
                     sources are likely to include one or more advisory boards. 
 
                     For example, the BOK project has an industrial advisory board. 
 
                     Such boards provide representation, expertise, and may possibly 
 
                     also provide individuals to participate in projects.<br>
 
                     - projects may elect to have panels of experts to provide 
 
                     expert review and evaluation of their activities. A panel 
 
                     of experts, for example, was used very successfully to review 
 
                     the code of ethics, and the BOK project is forming such a 
 
                     panel. This mechanism assures that the results have high credibility.</p>
