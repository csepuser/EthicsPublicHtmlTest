                   <p>This is a report to the software engineering advisory committee 
 
                     about some recent events of importance to our activity.</p>
 
                   <p>Last week the ACM Council considered several proposals related 
 
                     to software engineering. The IEEE Computer Society will consider 
 
                     the same proposals in early November. The gist of these proposals 
 
                     is to formally establish the Software Engineering Coordinating 
 
                     Committee (SWECC), which will act as the representative of 
 
                     both societies in software engineering matters, such as matters 
 
                     relating to licensing examinations. Between them, these two 
 
                     societies represent the vast majority of practicing software 
 
                     engineers and the Texas Licensing Committee has already requested 
 
                     and received support from them in connection with developing 
 
                     the body of knowledge and licensing examinations for software 
 
                     engineering.</p>
 
                   <p>This is a summary report of what happened and some of the 
 
                     issues raised. I think they indicate the deep concern among 
 
                     the ACM Council that software engineering be established in 
 
                     a responsible and professional manner.</p>
 
                   <p>The ACM Council endorsed the Code of Ethics for Software 
 
                     Engineers</p>
 
                   <p>The ACM Council Approved formation of the joint Software 
 
                     Engineering Coordinating Committee (SWECC), which will represent 
 
                     ACM and the IEEE Computer Society in dealing with software 
 
                     engineering matters.</p>
 
                   <p>Issues and concerns were raised in many areas, and I call 
 
                     your attention to these because I believe the Texas Board 
 
                     shares most if not all of these. Note: these are my paraphrasings 
 
                     of what was discussed by the ACM Council. These are not the 
 
                     official positions or statements of the Council, since most 
 
                     of these were not voted on.</p>
 
                   <p> <br>
 
                     Rather, they were communicated to me with the intent that 
 
                     I communicate them further.</p>
 
                   <p>Concerns and issues:<br>
 
                     > software engineering must be taken very seriously as its 
 
                     own unique discipline .care must be taken to see that individuals 
 
                     who would claim to be software engineers, especially licensed 
 
                     software engineers, have a very solid grounding in software 
 
                     engineering fundamentals. It is not sufficient, in ACM Council's 
 
                     view, for a PE from another field to have been developing 
 
                     software for a number of years. There must be assurance that 
 
                     they are CURRENT in the software engineering discipline and 
 
                     that they be FLUENT in the fundamentals of software engineering.<br>
 
                     > In particular, the Council urges licensing bodies to exercise 
 
                     great care not to &quot;grandfather&quot; existing PEs whose 
 
                     backgrounds are in other fields without making sure they are 
 
                     well grounded and current in software engineering as a discipline. 
 
                     (It was noted that some of the greatest software engineering 
 
                     disasters on record were developed by licensed PEs (from other 
 
                     disciplines). This helps make the point that traditional engineering 
 
                     methods, alone, are not sufficient for proper development 
 
                     of software).<br>
 
                     > software engineering is a very rapidly evolving discipline 
 
                     and thus it is essential that the body of knowledge and examinations 
 
                     be regularly updated AND that practicing professionals be 
 
                     expected to participate in a serious and thoughtfully defined 
 
                     program of continuing education in order to maintain their 
 
                     credentials<br>
 
                     > the distinction between computer science and software engineering 
 
                     must be clearly delineated, although there is a high degree 
 
                     of overlap between these two disciplines<br>
 
                     > at the same time, it is essential that software engineering's 
 
                     roots in mathematics be recognized. In some important ways 
 
                     software engineering is distinct from other traditional engineering 
 
                     fields, and this distinction goes to the heart of why it is 
 
                     an important discipline on its own. This distinction must 
 
                     not be lost in the process of establishing software engineering 
 
                     as a professional discipline.<br>
 
                     > the fundamentals of engineering examination should ultimately 
 
                     be revised to reflect the fact that software engineering and 
 
                     certain other</p>
 
                   <p>engineering disciplines are founded more on mathematics than 
 
                     science and therefore should (at least for any option taken 
 
                     by candidates for software engineering licenses) include stronger 
 
                     emphasis on subjects such as discrete mathematics and statistics 
 
                     and should not depend on topics such as thermodynamics and 
 
                     strength of materials, which are</p>
 
                   <p> <br>
 
                     irrelevant to most software engineering applications.  undergraduate 
 
                     curricula in software engineering might become distorted if 
 
                     students are forced to take courses in topics like thermodynamics 
 
                     and strength of materials in order to qualify for the FoE 
 
                     examination. Since many states are now severely limiting the 
 
                     number of credit hours that a</p>
 
                   <p>student may take to get a bachelor's degree, this is a particularly 
 
                     acute concern at this time . a great many computer science 
 
                     programs are not housed in colleges of engineering, and in 
 
                     many colleges these are the logical places to incorporate 
 
                     software engineering programs. Care must be taken that the 
 
                     procedures established for software engineering do not inhibit 
 
                     the establishment of accreditable software engineering programs 
 
                     outside colleges of engineering. (The CSAB model which currently 
 
                     works for computer science, would seem to be a logical starting 
 
                     point for software engineering, and the pending integration 
 
                     of CSAB with ABET should further facilitate this) . Licensing 
 
                     of the individuals who make a product does not, by itself, 
 
                     assure that the product is built correctly. This is especially 
 
                     important for software because it is intangible and its flaws 
 
                     are often very subtle and hard to detect. Thus consideration 
 
                     should be given to product certification in addition to licensing, 
 
                     in order to achieve the</p>
 
                   <p>objectives of assuring public health, safety and welfare. 
 
                     > there are many vehicles in place already that might be used 
 
                     as a basis for such certification  for example various international 
 
                     standards for software development and the SEI's Capability 
 
                     Maturity Model for software management and processes.</p>
 
                   <p>ACM Council also requests that there be a deliberate effort 
 
                     to guage the support for licensing among industry and other 
 
                     sectors. I have indicated that one such guage is the extent 
 
                     to which industry is willing to fund the development of the 
 
                     body of knowledge and the licensing examinations.</p>
 
                   <p>There is also concern about the state laws requiring that 
 
                     faculty who teach engineering be licensed. There are several 
 
                     aspects of this concern:  if they teach software engineering, 
 
                     they need to be competent in software engineering. There is 
 
                     fear that a faculty member in, say, civil engineering might 
 
                     be approved to teach software engineering because he is a 
 
                     licensed PE, whereas a faculty member in computer science 
 
                     who has extensive software engineering background but lacks 
 
                     an engineering degree might not be permitted to teach it<br>
 
                     3 of 4<br>
 
                     7/26/2005 4:57 PM</p>
 
                   <p> <br>
 
                     > software engineering should be teachable outside of engineering 
 
                     schools . access to accreditation should be available regardless 
 
                     of what college of the university teaches software engineering</p>
 
                   <p>I think this is a fair summary of the ACM Council's concerns. 
 
                     The ACM Council includes some of the most highly respected 
 
                     computer and software specialists in the world. I am pleased 
 
                     to note that their concerns mirror many of those we have discussed 
 
                     in our deliberations with the licensing committee.</p>
