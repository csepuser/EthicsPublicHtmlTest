                     December 9, 1998 </p>
 
                   <p>Introduction Contracting Conclusions Background Types of 
 
                     Contracts References Computer Ethics Issues Enclosures Software 
 
                     Acquisition Recommendations Introduction Observing the direction 
 
                     in Military procurement, the purchase of software, both embedded 
 
                     into weapons systems and as stand alone products, is a large 
 
                     $268 billion dollar part of the Department of Defense's acquisition 
 
                     strategy. This reliance on software evolved as technological 
 
                     advances in the software industry allowed for the creation 
 
                     of products that can do more (process more memory, work faster, 
 
                     aim a missile straighter, etc.). The government relies on 
 
                     software to meet the needs of the soldier for more capable 
 
                     systems, yet there is a general lack of understand the capabilities 
 
                     of software, and how to manage the procurement. As the software 
 
                     industry has seen rapid expansion, the parallel development 
 
                     of ethical standards of conduct for software engineers (those 
 
                     that write the code) has not matured as quickly. These two 
 
                     factors create a dilemma for the contracting of that software, 
 
                     since the limited understanding by the user and the lack of 
 
                     industry standards increase the risk that software acquisitions 
 
                     will not meet the user requirements. </p>
 
                   <p>The purpose of my paper is to research how the Department 
 
                     of Defense can improve the acquisition of software applications 
 
                     and embedded software, and ensure ethical practices in the 
 
                     software engineers. First, I will begin with an overview of 
 
                     what are ethics, and how the computer industry defines ethics 
 
                     in the development of software. Next, I will review how the 
 
                     Department of Defense (DoD) acquires software, and the problems 
 
                     that arise. Lastly, I shall examine the issues in the development 
 
                     of software, and discuss what actions the Government can take 
 
                     to ensure the acquisition of the best software products for 
 
                     the user. </p>
 
                   <p>Top Background To understand ethical practices in software 
 
                     engineering and contract, it is important to establish what 
 
                     are ethics and how they apply to the computer industry. Webster's 
 
                     revised unabridged dictionary (1913) defines ethics as: &quot;The 
 
                     science of human duty; the body of rules of duty drawn from 
 
                     this science; a particular system of principles and rules 
 
                     concerting duty, whether true or false; rules of practice 
 
                     in respect to a single class of human actions; as, political 
 
                     or social ethics; medical ethics.&quot; I understand ethics 
 
                     as a combination of two factors. First, ethics is a study 
 
                     of morals. The personal decision of what is right and what 
 
                     is wrong. Second, ethics is a standard for behavior of a particular 
 
                     group, such as Business Ethics or Medical Ethics. In a purchase 
 
                     transaction, there are ethical standards for the buyer and 
 
                     the seller. As a buyer, FAR part 3.101 requires that &quot;Government 
 
                     business shall be conducted in a manner above reproach&#8230;.&quot; 
 
                     I understand this and other factors to mean that the Department 
 
                     of Defense (military and civilian) personnel are held to the 
 
                     higher ethical standard than other professions, for two reasons.</p>
 
                   <p> First, those professionals are morally obligated to follow 
 
                     the orders of their superiors or be courageous in the face 
 
                     of physical danger (both will go into combat zones) [Ref 24]. 
 
                     Second, government employees, especially the military, are 
 
                     more in the public spotlight that other workers, and while 
 
                     being scrutinized, they are bound more strictly to the moral 
 
                     standards that apply to everyone else. Although these explanations 
 
                     show the need for high ethical standard for government officials, 
 
                     what ethical standards should DoD expect in the defense industry? 
 
                     First, DFARS part 203.7000 cites that &quot;Government contractors 
 
                     must conduct themselves with the highest degree of honesty 
 
                     and integrity.&quot; The DFARS goes on to state that the contractor's 
 
                     management controls provide for a written ethical code, a 
 
                     reporting mechanism, and a disciplinary system for improper 
 
                     conduct. Second, I believe we should expect that the work 
 
                     produced by defense contractors represent the ethics and ideals 
 
                     of the personnel who use the products or benefit from the 
 
                     services. Few in society will blame the contractor when the 
 
                     artillery shell lands outside the engagement area and into 
 
                     the commissary parking lot, yet the round may overshoot due 
 
                     to a faulty trajectory plan as determined by the on-board 
 
                     computer. The newspaper headlines might state that the howitzer 
 
                     is to blame and is unsafe to use, but focus of condemnation 
 
                     will be on the military (why did we buy such an unsafe weapon?).</p>
 
                   <p> The ethical practices in our contractors must start with 
 
                     a clear statement of the standards that govern the conduct 
 
                     of all employees in their relationships to the industry. This 
 
                     should be followed up with specific ethical policies for the 
 
                     specific company, in its dealings with customers, suppliers, 
 
                     competitors, and oversight personnel. This statement also 
 
                     must state the consequences of violating those standards, 
 
                     and the responsibility of management for monitoring and enforcing 
 
                     the standards. [Ref 13] </p>
 
                   <p>What are computer ethics? Before understanding the standards 
 
                     of ethics in software engineering and the contracting for 
 
                     software, it is important to establish a baseline of what 
 
                     ethics standards are currently in place (as published by the 
 
                     industry). In a more broad definition, &quot;Computer ethics 
 
                     is generally presented as any misuse of computer technology, 
 
                     from stock fraud to using the word processor to make Christmas 
 
                     letters, or it is portrayed as any significant social issue 
 
                     involving computers.&quot; [Ref 28] Unfortunately, this is 
 
                     too general a definition to explain of the relationship between 
 
                     the government and a software contractor for the writing of 
 
                     new software products. Computer ethics deals with the actions 
 
                     a user partakes while using a computer, such as while surfing 
 
                     the Internet, or when it is permissible to use the office 
 
                     computer to play solitaire. In my attempt to narrow the definition 
 
                     to software ethics, I found an unanticipated lack of published 
 
                     ethical standards.</p>
 
                   <p> Dr. Donald Gotterbarn, Professor at East Tennessee State 
 
                     Universities School for Ethics commented that, &quot;[This] 
 
                     absence of published ethical standards is surprising because 
 
                     industry perceives a need for training in software engineering 
 
                     ethics. The significance industry gives to this is evident 
 
                     by the place of ethics officers in corporations, e.g., the 
 
                     ethics officers of Boeing Computer Services, Raytheon, and 
 
                     Texas Instruments are all CEOs at the vice presidential level.&quot; 
 
                     [Ref 28] In my attempt to research Dr. Gotternbarn's assertion, 
 
                     I interviewed three professors from the Naval Postgraduate 
 
                     School concerning the amount of ethics training given to graduate 
 
                     students working toward their master's degree in software 
 
                     engineering. All three professors came to the same conclusion. 
 
                     Not only does the Naval Postgraduate School not specifically 
 
                     teach ethics courses to the students in software engineering, 
 
                     but also there is no perceived need for the training. There 
 
                     are lecture blocks on computer ethics, since the Computer 
 
                     Science Accreditation Board requires some discussion of ethics 
 
                     in the curriculum for the school to be accredited. However, 
 
                     there are no discussions on ethical actions during the writing 
 
                     of code. This overall lack of training in software ethics 
 
                     downplays its importance, and leaves open the possibility 
 
                     of violations.</p>
 
                   <p> I located very few discussions referring to ethics training 
 
                     for Software Engineers, and those I did find generally centered 
 
                     specifically on the shortages of such training. I envision 
 
                     this omission of ethical training in the education of software 
 
                     engineers is caused by a mindset in the industry that is focused 
 
                     with defining the technical standards of software engineering, 
 
                     and not enforcing the ethical actions of the engineer. Even 
 
                     the best available definitions for software ethics subdivide 
 
                     the topic into the technical merits (like business ethics) 
 
                     and the professional ethics (for decision making), instead 
 
                     of what actions or mindsets a software engineer should have. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute 
 
                     of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) have both 
 
                     published standards for ethics in the computer industry, but 
 
                     these standards are not as valuable for the software engineer, 
 
                     since they focus on general engineering and computer respectively, 
 
                     and not the combination of both. (See Enclosure 1). In short, 
 
                     although the computer industry beliefs are that ethics in 
 
                     general is important, the writing of quality code is more 
 
                     important. I believe this is a signal for potential danger, 
 
                     since the software industry is a booming industry, yet the 
 
                     focus of the workers and leadership is on product (working 
 
                     software) and not the process (how did we make it work). </p>
 
                   <p>Software Acquisition The DoD has many approaches to choose 
 
                     from in the construction of an acquisition strategy. According 
 
                     to DoD 5000.2, three typical models include the traditional 
 
                     model, the grand design model, and the incremental model. 
 
                     The traditional model uses a structure of Concept Exploration, 
 
                     Program Development and Risk Reduction, Engineering and Manufacturing 
 
                     Development, and Production/Fielding. The grand design model 
 
                     combines concept, development, and fielding into a single 
 
                     step. The incremental model phases the steps of acquisition, 
 
                     and is used when requirements are well understood, but other 
 
                     considerations (risks, funding, schedule, etc.) require more 
 
                     time to develop. Software acquisition can use any of these 
 
                     models in a similar fashion to hardware programs. One difference 
 
                     is that the product you receive is not an item you can hold 
 
                     or a service you can observe, but a computer program or an 
 
                     internal mechanism for a piece of hardware. Since the choice 
 
                     of model depends on maturity of requirements and time available, 
 
                     stand-alone software acquisitions generally use the traditional 
 
                     model, where embedded software follows the strategy of the 
 
                     associated hardware product. Another difference is in testing, 
 
                     where stand-alone software testing may be less physical yet 
 
                     but more interactive with the intelligence of the user, and 
 
                     hardware testing will demonstrate the capabilities of the 
 
                     hardware system.</p>
 
                   <p> Contracting The difficulty in software acquisition is founded 
 
                     in the requirements analysis and the lack of understanding 
 
                     of costs, especially during contract administration. This 
 
                     is true for three reasons. First, the definitions of user 
 
                     needs/requirements change with technology. Either the user 
 
                     defines requirements based on current technology, which can 
 
                     be obsolete before equipment is fielded, or the requirements 
 
                     are defined based on projections of technology, which may 
 
                     not be met. Second, the majority of cost in a software program 
 
                     is not in the initial writing of code, but in the debugging 
 
                     of the code (similar to multiple attempts at developmental 
 
                     testing an item of hardware). Finally, the software industry 
 
                     has a shortage of software engineers, so those available engineers 
 
                     are sought by the best paying (and most expensive companies). 
 
                     Realizing the difficulties in software acquisition, the Defense 
 
                     Contract Management Center (DCMC) established a ten-step process 
 
                     for software specialists to assist the contracting officer 
 
                     in the acquisition of software. [Ref 12] Although some consideration 
 
                     is given to pre-award activities, the focus is contract administration. 
 
                     The highlights from this list include:</p>
 
                   <p> 1. Specifications and Standards. Review the specifications 
 
                     and standards included in the RFP, identify potential risk 
 
                     areas, and provide focus on areas to emphasize. More work 
 
                     done before contract award leads to less problems after award. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>2. Review documentation and resources. Items such as the 
 
                     contract, the Statement of Work (SOW), and the software specific 
 
                     paperwork, (Software Development Plan (SDP), Software Quality 
 
                     Assurance (SQA) Plan, etc.) help in the identification of 
 
                     requirements, schedules, perform planning, and possible high 
 
                     risk in the areas of technical, schedule, quality and cost. 
 
                     Resources, including Government Furnished Equipment and firmware 
 
                     must be adequate to develop and test the software. </p>
 
                   <p>3. Verify proper provisions for Government rights to the 
 
                     data produced under contract. Most commercial off the shelf 
 
                     software products contain clauses that retain all data rights, 
 
                     and restrict usage of the software, such as to one machine. 
 
                     Software that would be required on multiple systems (such 
 
                     as a stockpile of missile guidance systems) requires more 
 
                     freedom to the data.</p>
 
                   <p> 4. Identify, discuss, and attempt to resolve contract deficiencies. 
 
                     The longer a problem goes unresolved and the contractor makes 
 
                     the action a routine, the less probability to change the behavior 
 
                     later. </p>
 
                   <p>5. Participate In A Post-Award Orientation Conference (PAOC): 
 
                     Identify misunderstandings, conflicts or misinterpretations 
 
                     in the contract. PAOC's are very useful for contractors who 
 
                     have never performed computer software development under a 
 
                     government contract, or if the software development plans 
 
                     do not adequately describe how work will be performed. </p>
 
                   <p>6. Develop A Surveillance Plan that supplements the Contract 
 
                     Administration Office (CAO) plan to monitor the contractor&#8217;s 
 
                     development of software. Identify surveillance activities 
 
                     such as requirements traceability, metrics to be used, processes 
 
                     to be assessed, product audits and milestone dates. Highlight 
 
                     areas of cost, schedule, quality and technical performance 
 
                     risk that would suggest a need for increased surveillance. 
 
                     (See Enclosure 2 for the Software Development Surveillance 
 
                     Flowchart). The Naval Command, Control, and Ocean Surveillance 
 
                     Center's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Division 
 
                     (NRaD) has also developed a flow diagram to assist Project 
 
                     (Program) Managers identify the scope of activity needed in 
 
                     the procurement and oversight of software contracts. It helps 
 
                     to document the processes that all software project managers 
 
                     use in planning, working to develop, and maintaining software, 
 
                     all in an effort to establish best practices and lessons learned. 
 
                     (See Enclosure 3).</p>
 
                   <p> Initial goals that NRaD established for Program Managers 
 
                     includes [Ref 42]: </p>
 
                   <p>1. Selection of qualified contractors. Past performance must 
 
                     be a factor in the source selection evaluation. </p>
 
                   <p>2. Understanding of standards, procedures, and requirements 
 
                     written into the contract by both the Government and the Contractor. 
 
                     The clearer the requirements in the contract are to both side, 
 
                     the less appeals and legal actions later in the program. </p>
 
                   <p>3. Communications throughout the lifecycle of the contract. 
 
                     Having the contractor, a software engineer, and a government 
 
                     representative on an integrated product team will help identify 
 
                     and solve potential conflicts as they arise. </p>
 
                   <p>4. Governmental tracking of contractor's actual results and 
 
                     performance against contract requirements. This will lead 
 
                     to a better visualization of potential shortfalls and reduce 
 
                     the risk of breaking cost, schedule, and performance baselines. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p> Types of Contracts The criteria for software contract selection 
 
                     are similar to those for hardware systems. FAR part 16 describes 
 
                     that contract types be determined by the Government to make 
 
                     the contractor's cost responsibility proportionate with the 
 
                     risk required to perform. For software, when requirements 
 
                     are well defined (such as for software upgrades) and the risk 
 
                     of development is low, a fixed-price contract is used. When 
 
                     requirements are less well understood and development risk 
 
                     is high, a more flexible cost-reimbursable contract is the 
 
                     better choice. Indefinite delivery contracts are used for 
 
                     software support efforts, since maintena nce requirements, 
 
                     scheduling, and the availability of funds may be later defined 
 
                     based on needs from the user. [Ref 42] In practice, actual 
 
                     contracts used on systems vary between the services and commands, 
 
                     although the trend is toward cost contracts due to the risks. 
 
                     According to David Zentner of the DCMC Software Center, &quot;When 
 
                     large new software intensive systems are procured, the Government 
 
                     generally chooses to go with Cost Reimbursable contracts, 
 
                     to provide for sharing of the risk between the Government 
 
                     and the contractor.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>Issues I believe there are two fundamental issues in software 
 
                     procurement for the federal government. First, the government 
 
                     gets overcharged (in life cycle costs) for software because 
 
                     we do not have enough experience or expertise in the area 
 
                     to understand what is being procured (analysis of cost and 
 
                     pricing data). These leads to contract awards being based 
 
                     solely on the lowest priced software proposal, and not a combination 
 
                     of life cycle costs, scheduled deliveries, and performance 
 
                     factors. Eventually, the government is forced to buy maintenance 
 
                     agreements or software upgrades from the contractors that 
 
                     add to the initial purchase, usually at substantially higher 
 
                     prices. Second, that the government buys software that does 
 
                     not meet long-term needs, or is not mature enough to meet 
 
                     operational testing requirements (This stems from the users 
 
                     request that software solve all problems that cannot be fixed 
 
                     by additional hardware, regardless of the technical feasibility.) 
 
                     My beliefs fall in line with the OSD &quot;Improving Software 
 
                     Acquisition Management&quot; workshops top five problem areas 
 
                     in software acquisition [Ref 38], namely, &middot; Requirements 
 
                     - Often too vague and often expand mid-acquisition. &middot; 
 
                     Mismatch between &quot;acquirer&quot; and &quot;supplier&quot; 
 
                     maturity - Either the contractor or the government does not 
 
                     understand the requirement enough to build the correct product. 
 
                     &middot; Short term vs. long term perspective and expectations 
 
                     - Is the software a short term fix to a crisis problem (so 
 
                     requirements for continuous upgrades is acceptable [example 
 
                     = Patriot Missile]), or is this software a long term product 
 
                     (such as the Global Command and Control System). &middot; 
 
                     Resources to implement - Does the program office have the 
 
                     time, money, people, and training to understand and supervise 
 
                     the acquisition? &middot; Organizational commitment to change 
 
                     (&quot;Corps&quot; down to &quot;team&quot;) - Sharing of 
 
                     information between contractor and government in an alliance 
 
                     will result in better systems. For ethical issues, the dilemma 
 
                     for a contractor falls between factors of cost, schedule, 
 
                     and performance. Systems fielded on time and at cost may not 
 
                     be sufficiently tested against contingencies that the programmer 
 
                     expects to occur, but if those tests are not specified in 
 
                     the contract (such as system overloads), it is not a requirement 
 
                     (hence the contractor does not have to do it, but the question 
 
                     is should he do it). The system that performs with all possible 
 
                     glitches fixed (without potential system failures) often will 
 
                     be above cost and schedule objectives. This will lead to unhappy 
 
                     government administrators (which may lead to loss of future 
 
                     contract after being labeled a poor performer.) As an example 
 
                     of this, I will use an equipment tracking program. This acquisition 
 
                     system will be tested for use with all equipment specifically 
 
                     listed in the contract. I will assume that it has passed all 
 
                     developmental and operational tests. After passing these milestones, 
 
                     it still may not, however, have other desirable capabilities, 
 
                     such as the flexibility to add in future weapons systems, 
 
                     or handle Joint/Combined equipment tracking (which was not 
 
                     a requirement, but simple to write into the program, and a 
 
                     reasonable follow on stage for the software). The contractor 
 
                     must choose between releasing the product and continuing to 
 
                     work on upgrades while it is being used, or failing to release 
 
                     the product, possibly defaulting on the contract, but maintaining 
 
                     that the system was not ready for the user actual needs (actual 
 
                     versus stated needs). At worst case, people can die due to 
 
                     faulty software. This software usually performed its routine 
 
                     tasks well, and therefore passes testing and is bought/ fielded. 
 
                     Unfortunately for the user, poor design or debugging against 
 
                     predictable situation can lead to the loss of lives.</p>
 
                   <p> One example of this is: &quot;In 1992, the London Ambulance 
 
                     Service placed into operation a new computerized dispatching 
 
                     system without any organized backup procedure. When the system 
 
                     overloaded, the operator had no ability to dispatch calls 
 
                     manually. Some callers were put on hold for up to 30 minutes. 
 
                     One disabled woman was trapped in her chair by the body of 
 
                     her collapsed husband. By the time an ambulance finally arrived, 
 
                     her husband had died. [Ref 26]&quot; I do not believe however 
 
                     that the government or the defense contractors for the government 
 
                     face this type of ethical issue. Most of my research indicates 
 
                     a true desire on the part of the government and the software 
 
                     contractor to field the highest level of performance software. 
 
                     The concern is not will the system work, but will the system 
 
                     need upgrades, and how much will upgrades and other maintenance 
 
                     actions cost. Ted Lewis, Lecturer at the Naval Postgraduate 
 
                     School, explained the issue this way: &quot;The government 
 
                     gets snookered. We get locked into a desire for the latest 
 
                     technology at the lowest cost. When the cost is lowest up 
 
                     front, we pay more to fix [the bugs] later.&quot; [Ref 36] 
 
                     The government has difficulty in effectively pricing the costs 
 
                     within software development programs, since attempts at estimating 
 
                     the engineer labor hours required are only partially successful 
 
                     at best. Most of the time required to write a program is not 
 
                     in the initial writing of code, but in the debug process. 
 
                     The reuse of code concept can save money in the initial writing 
 
                     of code, but this process often takes longer to debug (unless 
 
                     the original code was written with reuse in the plan). A software 
 
                     surveillance representative has to truly understand the intricacies 
 
                     of software engineering in order to know when a software program 
 
                     is requiring more man- hours than expected. A rule of thumb 
 
                     for industry expects new code development at 5-12 lines per 
 
                     week, and 12-20 lines per week for reused code [Ref 51]. These 
 
                     are only gauges, but are methods for estimations of price. 
 
                     This same calculation should be used as an evaluation technique 
 
                     of the price estimates in contract proposals (to check for 
 
                     price realism).</p>
 
                   <p> As most contracts are written as cost reimbursable contracts 
 
                     (priced by man-hours required [Ref 51]), the longer it takes 
 
                     to write and debug a program, the more money a contractor 
 
                     will receive. One tool available for cost estimation is called 
 
                     COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model, versions 81 and II). This 
 
                     program calculates software costs based on the number of source 
 
                     lines of code, the use of the program (stand-alone software 
 
                     or embedded), product attributes (reliability), computer attributes 
 
                     (storage, speed), personnel attributes (experience level), 
 
                     and project attributes (schedule). The use of programs like 
 
                     this take some of the variability and unknowns out of the 
 
                     process, but they are still developing in reliability and 
 
                     usefulness to military programs. </p>
 
                   <p> Recommendations In my opinion, the best ways the Department 
 
                     of Defense has to avoid software and ethical issues are through 
 
                     effective contract administration (software development surveillance) 
 
                     and better contracting for software. Improvements in contract 
 
                     administration require an emphasis on training both the government 
 
                     and the contractor. Better contracting fo r software can be 
 
                     achieved through the implementation of the best practices 
 
                     of the computer industry. In response to these two situations, 
 
                     and the fact that DCMC was spending 37% of its funding on 
 
                     software with only 7% of its personnel trained on software, 
 
                     [Ref 11] the DoD established the DCMC Software Center. The 
 
                     goal of this center is to establish training for software 
 
                     representatives and capture the best practices and processes 
 
                     from government and industry for use on all other software 
 
                     acquisitions and contracts. Some specific tasks of this center 
 
                     include [Ref 39] &middot; Support source selection, develop 
 
                     a software process repository; interface with the Software 
 
                     Engineering Institute &middot; Provide guidance and technical 
 
                     support on Post Award surveillance activities &middot; Ensure 
 
                     a highly competent software workforce, manages the Software 
 
                     Professional Development Program Level III (senior level) 
 
                     certification process &middot; Provide integrated tool box 
 
                     for surveillance personnel I believe the government must train 
 
                     the administrative contracting officers and the software representatives 
 
                     in software surveillance techniques. Topics should include 
 
                     what warning signs to watch that indicate violations; how 
 
                     to ask questions to gauge the ethical atmosphere; and how 
 
                     to conduct basic reviews of corporate ethical standards. (What 
 
                     are the rules and the punishment for breaking those rules?) 
 
                     Contractors should have internal training programs for ethics, 
 
                     mechanisms to report violations, and well defined disciplinary 
 
                     actions corresponding to those infractions. Effortless reporting 
 
                     ethical reminders are as simple as posting the DoD Hotline 
 
                     poster (for contract awards over $5 million.)</p>
 
                   <p> One functional training plan in process today is the Air 
 
                     Force's Software Professional Development Program (SPDP). 
 
                     This program strives to improve general software engineering 
 
                     expertise, by offering a curriculum in software engineering 
 
                     (four courses via distance learning and one laboratory capstone 
 
                     course taught at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio). This 
 
                     class is mandatory for entry-level members of the software 
 
                     engineer career field to upgrade and be awarded the fully 
 
                     qualified status. Besides training of personnel, the government 
 
                     can improve its software acquisition through the adoption 
 
                     of the best business practices in industry. (Note: This is 
 
                     the idea embedded in acquisition reform). The Airlie Software 
 
                     Council identified nine principal best practices observed 
 
                     in industry, and deemed them essential for nearly all DoD 
 
                     software development projects. [Ref 43] Some important principles 
 
                     include: 1. Establishment of a formal risk management process, 
 
                     requiring corporate acceptance of risk as a major consideration 
 
                     for software program management. This includes commitment 
 
                     of program resources, and established methods for identifying, 
 
                     monitoring, and managing risk. 3. Conducting inspections on 
 
                     the requirements, architecture, detailed design, code, and 
 
                     test plans. 6. Render the core indicators of project status 
 
                     readily available to all project participants. 9. Make management 
 
                     accountable training as well as for fostering an environment 
 
                     conducive to high morale and low voluntary staff turnover. 
 
                     The desired outcome of the training and best practice use 
 
                     is a higher quality, lower risk program. </p>
 
                   <p>Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute 
 
                     developed a certification system that incorporates training, 
 
                     use of best practices, and other management factors to rate 
 
                     programs on their maturity and ability to field a quality 
 
                     program. The Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model 
 
                     (SA-CMM) describes the essential elements of managing and 
 
                     improving the acquisition process in an organization, and 
 
                     outlines a managed path for improving the process for acquiring 
 
                     software. [Ref 3] I would compare the use of this model to 
 
                     the drive in industry toward ISO 9001 and other similar standards. 
 
                     Although ISO has a draft standard for software engineering 
 
                     (ISO 12207), more respect is given to companies with a higher 
 
                     CMM level. The Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon 
 
                     University estimates that if you contract with a level one 
 
                     company, you can expect to pay $300-660 per line of code, 
 
                     and have 3-9 defects per work unit. When you contract with 
 
                     a level three company, you can expect to pay only $140 per 
 
                     line on code, and have one defect per work unit [Ref 3]. It 
 
                     was interesting to discover that using this graded scale, 
 
                     only three commercial companies and one government agency 
 
                     (The Ogden Air Logistics Center, Software Engineering Division 
 
                     at Hill Air Force Base, Utah) have been assessed as Level 
 
                     5 maturity organizations to date. The bottom line is that 
 
                     using this model, a contractor better understand the quality 
 
                     and costs associated with a contract action, to reduce some 
 
                     of the unknowns, and ultimately negotiate for a better software 
 
                     product at a fair and reasonable price.</p>
 
                   <p> Conclusion Contracting for software is not a simple task, 
 
                     since the state of technology expands so rapidly and the government 
 
                     does not have the expertise to manage the process. DoD has 
 
                     improved its software acquisition ability through the use 
 
                     of training programs and incorporation of the best practices 
 
                     from industry. I do not believe there are problems in the 
 
                     ethical behavior of software engineers involved in government 
 
                     contracts. However, the lack of industry standards and formalized 
 
                     training in ethics for those engineers is a source for future 
 
                     concern. There also is a potential source of ethical violations 
 
                     if the government contracts are overcharging the government 
 
                     for software due to the lack of experts in understanding the 
 
                     costs associated with writing code. To lower the risks for 
 
                     these concerns affecting government procurements, contracting 
 
                     officers must continue their vigilance in contract administration 
 
                     and software surveillance.</p>
