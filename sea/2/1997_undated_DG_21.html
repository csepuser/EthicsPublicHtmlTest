                   <div align="justify">Dear Leonard Tripp: </div>
 
                   <p align="justify">As the new IEEE-CS Co-Chair of the Joint 
 
                     Steering Committee, I thought I should give you a status report 
 
                     on the work of the Software Engineering Ethics and Professional 
 
                     Practices task force. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">We worked on the Software Engineering Code 
 
                     of Ethics and Professional Practice for almost two years, 
 
                     basing it on other computing and engineering codes. It was 
 
                     a broad based development effort--truly international in participation 
 
                     -- with contributions from a wide range of practitioners.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The successive versions of the Code went 
 
                     through a number of significant reviews--both formal and informal. 
 
                     Version 3 was published in both Computer and the Communications 
 
                     of the ACM with a turn around ballot. Most items had at least 
 
                     a 95% approval rating. The code was also reviewed by ethics 
 
                     officers of various multi-nationals--Lockheed Martin, DEC, 
 
                     Northrop Gruman, etc. It was also reviewed by other professional 
 
                     computer organizations, such as the British Computer Society, 
 
                     the Australian Computer Society, and IFIP. The review process 
 
                     spread beyond our initial plan--companies like TI and Hitachi 
 
                     asked and received permission to put it on their company bulletin 
 
                     boards for review by their employees. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Version 4 took all of these comments into 
 
                     account. There were primarily three kinds of changes. We cleared 
 
                     up clauses that caused some misunderstanding. We also made 
 
                     some structural changes. The most important change was the 
 
                     removal of several imperatives which requested that software 
 
                     engineers do things which were really beyond their control. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The evidence from many outside sources is 
 
                     that we are very close to the mark. Several companies-- including 
 
                     IT shops and software engineering shops-- have recommended 
 
                     the Code as a standard of conduct; it has been posted as an 
 
                     example code of conduct by the Business Software Alliance. 
 
                     The Texas Board of Professional Engineering, Licensing Committee 
 
                     is considering the Code for their proposed licensing standard 
 
                     for Software Engineers. I just heard recently that the Code 
 
                     was used in a program in Australia for industrialists. It 
 
                     has already been published several places and discussed at 
 
                     professional meetings, such as the recent Conference on Software 
 
                     Engineering Education and Training in Atlanta.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">With the kind of reception the Code is enjoying, 
 
                     my only concern is that we may have misdescribed the Code. 
 
                     It is really a Code of Ethics and a Code of Conduct. The Code 
 
                     defines an approach to practice, it says?- Follow best practices 
 
                     of the profession-? however those practices are technically 
 
                     understood at the moment. It does not really advocate any 
 
                     precise software engineering practice. The closest it comes 
 
                     to advocating a specific practice is in 3.1 &#8220;Work to 
 
                     follow industry standards when available that are most appropriate 
 
                     for the task at hand...&#8221; </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The task force is now working on papers on 
 
                     other generic issue, e.g., informed consent, and on examples 
 
                     of using the Code as guide to decision making. Fortunately, 
 
                     the clauses do not depend on the body of knowledge but have 
 
                     to do with a moral approach to practice. The elements of particular 
 
                     practices have to wait to be developed until we have more 
 
                     definitive statements from the other task forces. When we 
 
                     have this material we can cross reference elements in the 
 
                     Code to specific practices or do as the British Computer Society 
 
                     and have a physically separate Code of Practice. As the Education 
 
                     Task force moves forward, I think we ought to be working with 
 
                     them to incorporate professional issues into the curriculum.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Let me know how we can forward the process 
 
                     for the Code&#8217;s approval and other issues related to 
 
                     the work of the task force.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Sincerely, </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Don Gotterbarn Chair, </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">SEEPP Task Force </p>
