       version 2.1<br>
       ------------------------------------------------------------
     <p>In May of 1993, the Board of Governors of the IEEE-CS established a steering 
       committee for evaluating, planning, and coordinating actions related to 
       establishing software engineering as a profession. In that same year the 
       ACM Council endorsed the establishment of a Commission on Software Engineering. 
       By January of 1994, both societies formed a joint committee &quot;To establish 
       the appropriate set(s) of standards for professional practice of Software 
       Engineering upon which industrial decisions, professional certification, 
       and educational curricula can be based.&quot; To accomplish these tasks 
       they made the following recommendations:</p>
     <ol>
       <li> adopt standard definitions</li>
       <li> define required body of knowledge and recommended practices</li>
       <li> define ethical standards</li>
       <li> define educational curricula for undergraduate, graduate(MS) and continuing 
         education (for retraining and migration).</li>
     </ol>
     <p>The steering committee decided to accomplish these tasks through the establishment 
       of a series of task forces. Initially the task forces established were: 
       Software Engineering body of knowledge and recommended practices; Software 
       Engineering ethics and professional practices, and Software Engineering 
       curriculum.</p>
     <p><br>
       The purpose of the ethics task force is to document the ethical and professional 
       responsibilities and obligations of software engineers. This draft code 
       of ethics was developed by a task force of the Joint IEEE Computer Society 
       and Association for Computing Machinery Steering Committee for the Establishment 
       of Software Engineering as a Profession and has been reviewed by the Steering 
       Committee. The task force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional 
       Practices developed this code for a sub-specialization within the constituencies 
       of both of the professional societies. The intent of this distribution is 
       to solicit comments from practitioners and other interested parties.</p>
     <p><br>
       The draft evolved after extensive study of several computing and engineering 
       codes. All these codes try to educate and inspire the members of the professional 
       group that adopts the code. The code also informs the public about the responsibilities 
       that are important to a profession. Codes instruct practitioners about the 
       standards that society expects them to meet, and what their peers strive 
       for and expect of each other. Codes are not meant to encourage litigation, 
       and they are not legislation; but they do offer practical advice about issues 
       that matter to professionals and their clients and they do inform policy 
       makers. Based on the feedback from readers of this publication and from 
       other sources, a final draft of the code will be developed and presented 
       to the Steering Committee for approval.</p>
     <p><br>
       ------------------------------------------------------------<br>
       <strong>PREAMBLE v 2.1</strong></p>
     <p><br>
       Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, industry, government, 
       medicine, education, entertainment, social affairs, and ordinary life. Those 
       who contribute, by direct participation or by teaching, to the design and 
       development of software systems have significant opportunities both to do 
       good and to cause harm and to influence and enable others to do good or 
       cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, that this power will be used 
       for good, software engineers must commit themselves to making the design 
       and development of software a beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance 
       with that commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the following Code 
       of ethics.</p>
     <p> The Code contains eight keyword Principles related to the behavior of 
       and decisions made by professional software engineers, be they practitioners, 
       educators, managers and supervisors, or policy makers, as well as trainees 
       and students of the profession. The Principles identify the various relationships 
       in which individuals, groups, and organizations participate and the primary 
       obligations within these relationships.</p>
     <p>Each Principle of this code addresses three levels of ethical obligation 
       owed by professional software engineers in each of these relationships. 
       The first level identified is a set of ethical values which they share with 
       all other human beings by virtue of their humanity. The second level obliges 
       professionals to a higher order of care for those who may be affected by 
       their work. The third and deeper level comprises several obligations which 
       derive directly from elements unique to the professional practice of software 
       engineering. The Clauses of each Principle are illustrations of the various 
       levels of obligation included in that relationship.</p>
     <p>The Clauses under each Principle consist of three different types of statement 
       corresponding to each level. </p>
     <p>Level One: Aspire (to be human); Statements of aspiration provide vision 
       and objectives, are intended to direct professional behavior. These directives 
       require significant ethical judgement. </p>
     <p>Level Two:<br>
       Expect (to be professional); Statements of expectation express the obligations 
       of all professionals and professional attitudes. Again they do not describe 
       the specific behavior details but they clearly indicate professional responsibilities 
       in computing. Level Three: Demand (to use good practices); Statements of 
       demand assert more specific behavioral responsibilities within software 
       engineering which are more closely related to the current state of the art. 
       The range of statements is from the more general aspirational statement 
       to specific measurable requirements.</p>
     <p>Although all levels of professional obligation are recognized and because 
       the Code contains different types of statements, the Code is not intended 
       to be all inclusive nor is it intended that its individual parts be used 
       in isolation to justify errors of omissions or commission. The list of Principles 
       and Clauses is not exhaustive, and should not be read as separating the 
       acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical 
       situations. The Code is not a simple ethical algorithm which generates ethical 
       decisions. In some situations standards may conflict with each other or 
       with standards from other sources. These situations require the software 
       engineer to use ethical judgement to act in a manner which is most consistent 
       with the spirit of the code of ethics, given the circumstances.</p>
     <p>These ethical tensions can best be answered by thoughtful consideration 
       of fundamental principles, rather than reliance on detailed regulations. 
       These Principles should influence you to consider broadly who is affected 
       by your work; to examine if you and your colleagues are treating other human 
       beings with due respect; to speculate on how the public would view your 
       decision if they were reasonably well informed; to analyze how the least 
       empowered will be affected by your decision; and to consider if your acts 
       would be considered worthy of the ideal professional working as a software 
       engineer. Since this code represents a consensus of those engaged in the 
       profession one should take into account what is likely to be judged as the 
       most ethical way to act in the circumstances by informed, respected, and 
       experienced peers in possession of all the facts and only depart from such 
       a course for profound reasons, backed with careful judgement.</p>
     <p>The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering requires a code 
       that is adaptable and relevant to new situations as they occur. But even 
       in this generality, the code provides support for the software engineer 
       who needs to take positive action by documenting the ethical stance of the 
       profession; an ethical foundation to which individuals within teams and 
       the team as a whole can appeal. The code also helps to define those things 
       which are ethically improper to request of an software engineer.</p>
     <p>The code has an educational function, stating what is required of anyone 
       wishing to join or continue in the software engineering community. Because 
       it expresses the consensus of the profession on ethical issues it can be 
       used as a guide to decision making and as means to educate both the public 
       and aspiring professionals about the professional obligation of all software 
       engineers.<br>
       ----------------------------------------------------<br>
       <strong>PRINCIPLES v 2.1</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Principle 1: PRODUCT</strong></p>
     <p>Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, assure that the software 
       on which they work is useful and of acceptable quality to the public, the 
       employer, the client, and the user, completed on time and at reasonable 
       cost, and free of error. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
     <p>1.01. Ensure that specifications for software on which they work have been 
       well documented, satisfy the user's requirements, and have the client's 
       approval.</p>
     <p>1.02. Strive to understand fully the specifications for software on which 
       they work.</p>
     <p>1.03. Ensure that they are qualified, by an appropriate combination of 
       education and experience, for any project on which they work or propose 
       to work.</p>
     <p>1.04. Ensure proper and achievable goals and objectives for any project 
       on which they work.</p>
     <p>1.05 Ensure an appropriate methodology for any project on which they work

     <p>1.12 Delete, whenever appropriate, outdated or flawed data.</p>
     <p>1.13. Work to identify, define and address ethical, economic, cultural, 
       legal, and environmental issues.</p>
     <p>1.14. Promote maximum quality and minimum cost to the employer, the client, 
       the user, and the public and make any tradeoffs clear to all parties concerned.</p>
     <p>1.15. Work to follow industry standards that are most appropriate for the 
       task at hand, departing from these only when technically justified.<br>
       ------------------------------------------------------------</p>
     <p><strong>Principle 2: PUBLIC</strong></p>
     <p>Software engineers shall, in their professional role, act only in ways 
       consistent with the public safety, health and welfare. In particular, software 
       engineers shall:</p>
     <p>2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential 
       danger that they reasonably believe to be associated with the software or 
       related documents on which they work, or are aware of, may pose to the user, 
       a third party, or the environment.</p>
     <p>2.02. Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief that it 
       is safe, meets specifications, has passed appropriate tests, and does not 
       diminish quality of life or harm the environment.</p>
     <p>2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared under their supervision 
       or within their areas of competence and with which they are in agreement.</p>
     <p>2.04. Co-operate in efforts to address matters of grave public concern 
       in software or related documents.</p>
     <p>2.05 Endeavor to produce software that respects diversity. Issues of language, 
       different abilities, physical access, mental access, economic advantage, 
       and allocation of resources should all be considered.</p>
     <p>2.06. Be fair and truthful in all statements, particularly public ones, 
       concerning software or related documents.</p>
     <p>2.07. Not put self-interest, the interest of an employer, the interest 
       of a client, or the interest of the user ahead of the public's interest.</p>
     <p>2.08. Feel free to donate professional skills to good causes.</p>
     <p>2.09. Accept full responsibility for their own work.</p>
     <p> ------------------------------------------------------------</p>
     <p><strong>Principle 3: JUDGMENT</strong></p>
     <p>Software engineers shall, insofar as possible and consistent with Principle 
       2, protect both the independence of their professional judgment and their 
       reputation for such judgment. In particular, software engineers shall, as 
       appropriate:</p>
     <p>3.01 Maintain professional objectivity with respect to any software or 
       related documents they are asked to evaluate.</p>
     <p>3.02. Affix their signature only to documents prepared under their supervision 
       and within their areas of competence.</p>
     <p>3.03. Reject bribery.</p>
     <p>3.04. Accept no payback, kickback, or other payment from a third party 
       to a contract, except with the knowledge and consent of all parties to the 
       contract.</p>
     <p>3.05. Accept payment from only one party for any particular project, or 
       for services specific to that project, except when the circumstances have 
       been fully disclosed to parties concerned and they have given their informed 
       consent.</p>
     <p>3.06. Disclose to all concerned parties those conflicts of interest that 
       cannot reasonably be avoided or escaped and aspire to resolve them.</p>
     <p>3.07. Participate in no decision of a governmental or professional body, 
       as a member or advisor, concerned with software, or related documents, in 
       which they, their employer, or their client have a financial interest.</p>
     <p>3.08 Temper all technical judgements by the need to support and maintain 
       human values.</p>
     <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
     <p><strong>Principle 4: CLIENT AND EMPLOYER</strong></p>
     <p>Software engineers shall, consistent with the public health, safety, and 
       welfare, always act in professional matters as faithful agents and trustees 
       of their client or employer. In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
     <p>4.01. Provide service only in areas of their competence.</p>
     <p>4.02. Assure that any document upon which they rely has been approved by 
       someone authorized to approve it.</p>
     <p>4.03. Use the property of a client or employer only in ways properly authorized, 
       and with the client's or employer's knowledge and consent.</p>
     <p>4.04. Not knowingly use illegally obtained or retained software on equipment 
       of a client or employer or in work performed for a client or employer.</p>
     <p>4.05. Keep as confidential information gained in their professional work 
       that is not in the public domain (and is not inconsistent) , where such 
       confidentiality is consistent with matters of public concern.</p>
     <p>4.06. Identify, document, and report to the employer or the client any 
       problems or matters of social concern in the software or related documents 
       on which they work or of which they are aware.</p>
     <p>4.07. Inform the client or the employer promptly if, in their opinion, 
       a project is likely to fail, to prove too expensive, to violate intellectual 
       property legislation, in particular copyright, patent, and trademarks, or 
       otherwise be problematic.</p>
     <p>4.08. Accept no outside work detrimental to the work they perform for their 
       primary employer.</p>
     <p>4.09. Represent no interest adverse to their employer's without the employer's 
       specific consent , unless ethical considerations demand otherwise.</p>
     <p> ------------------------------------------------------------</p>
     <p><strong>Principle 5: MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
     <p>A software engineer in a management or leadership capacity Shall act fairly 
       and shall enable and encourage those who they lead to meet their own and 
       collective obligations, including those under this code. In particular, 
       those software engineers in leadership roles shall as appropriate:</p>
     <p>5.01. Assure that employees are informed of standards before being held 
       to them.</p>
     <p>5.02. Assure employees know the employer's policies and procedures for 
       protecting passwords, files, and other confidential information.</p>
     <p>5.03. Assign work only after taking into account appropriate contributions 
       of education and experience.</p>
     <p>5.04. Provide for due process in hearing charges of violation of an employer's 
       policy or of this code.</p>
     <p>5.05. Develop a fair agreement concerning ownership of any software artifact 
       an employee has contributed to.</p>
     <p>5.06. Attract employees only by full and accurate description of the conditions 
       of employment.</p>
     <p>5.07. Offer only fair and just remuneration.</p>
     <p>5.08. Not unjustly prevent a subordinate from taking a better job for which 
       that subordinate is qualified or experienced to do.</p>
     <p>5.09. Not ask an employee to do anything inconsistent with this code.</p>
     <p> ------------------------------------------------------------</p>
     <p><strong>Principle 6: PROFESSION</strong></p>
     <p>Software engineers shall, in all professional matters, advance both the 
       integrity and reputation of their profession as is consistent with public 
       health, safety, and welfare. In particular, software engineers shall, insofar 
       as possible:</p>
     <p>6.01. Associate only with reputable businesses and organizations.</p>
     <p>6.02. Assure that clients, employers, and supervisors know of the software 
       engineer's commitment to this code of ethics, and their own responsibility 
       under it.</p>
     <p>6.03. Support those who similarly do as this code requires.</p>
     <p>6.04. Help develop an organizational environment favorable to acting ethically.</p>
     <p>6.05. Report anything reasonably believed to be a violation of this code 
       to appropriate authorities.</p>
     <p>6.06. Take responsibility for detecting, correcting, and reporting errors 
       in software and associated documents on which they work.</p>
     <p>6.07. Only accept remuneration appropriate to professional qualifications 
       or experience.</p>
     <p>6.08. Be accurate in stating the characteristics of software on which they 
       work, avoiding not only false claims but claims that might reasonably be 
       supposed to be deceptive, misleading, or doubtful.</p>
     <p>6.09. Not promote their own interest at the expense of the profession.</p>
     <p>6.10. Obey all laws governing their work, insofar as such obedience is 
       consistent with the public health, safety, and welfare.</p>
     <p>6.11. Exercise professional responsibility to society by constructively 
       serving in civic affairs.</p>
     <p>6.12. Promote public knowledge of software engineering.</p>
     <p>6.13. Share useful software-related knowledge, inventions, or discoveries 
       with the profession, for example, by presenting papers at professional meetings, 
       by publishing articles in the technical press, and by serving on the profession's 
       standard-setting bodies.</p>
     <p> ------------------------------------------------------------</p>
     <p><strong>Principle 7: COLLEAGUES</strong></p>
     <p>Software engineers shall treat all those with whom they work fairly and 
       take positive steps to support these collegial activities. In particular, 
       software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
     <p>7.01. Assist colleagues in professional development.</p>
     <p>7.02. Review the work of other software engineers, which is not in the 
       public domain, only with their prior knowledge, provided this is consistent 
       with safety.</p>
     <p>7.03. Credit fully the work of others.</p>
     <p>7.04. Review the work of others in an objective, candid, and properly-documented 
       way.</p>
     <p>7.05. Give a fair hearing to the opinion, concern, or complaint of a colleague.</p>
     <p>7.06. Assist colleagues in being fully aware of current standard work practices 
       including policies and procedures for protecting passwords, files, security 
       measures in general, and other confidential information.</p>
     <p>7.07. Not interfere in the professional career progression of any colleague.</p>
     <p>7.08. Not take steps to supplant another software engineer after steps 
       have been taken for employment.</p>
     <p>7.09. In situations outside of their own areas of competence, call upon 
       the opinions of other professionals who have competence in that area.</p>
     <p> ------------------------------------------------------------</p>
     <p><strong>Principle 8: SELF</strong></p>
     <p>Software engineers shall, throughout their career, strive to enhance their 
       own ability to practice their profession as it should be practiced. In particular, 
       software engineers shall continually endeavor to:</p>
     <p>8.01. Further their knowledge of developments in the design, development, 
       and testing of software and related documents, together with the management 
       of the development process.</p>
     <p>8.02. Improve their ability to create safe, reliable, and useful quality 
       software at reasonable cost and within a reasonable time.</p>
     <p>8.03. Improve their ability to write accurate, informative, and literate 
       documents in support of software on which they work.</p>
     <p>8.04. Improve their understanding of the software and related documents 
       on which they work and of the environment in which they will be used.</p>
     <p>8.05. Improve their knowledge of the law governing the software and related 
       documents on which they work.</p>
     <p>8.06. Improve their knowledge of this code, its interpretation, and its 
       application to their work.</p>
     <p>8.07. Not require or attempt to influence any person to take any action 
       which involves a breach of this code.</p>
     <p>8.08. Consider violations of this code inconsistent with being a professional 
       software engineer.</p>
