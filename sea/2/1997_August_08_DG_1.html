                   <p align="center"><strong> PREAMBLE v (2.last) </strong></p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Computers now have a central and growing 
 
                     role in commerce, industry, government, medicine, education, 
 
                     entertainment, social affairs, and ordinary life. Those who 
 
                     contribute, by direct participation or by teaching, to the 
 
                     design and development of software systems have significant 
 
                     opportunities both to do good or to cause harm, and to influence 
 
                     and enable others to do good or cause harm. To assure, as 
 
                     much as possible, that this power will be used for good, software 
 
                     engineers must commit themselves to making the design and 
 
                     development of software a beneficial and respected profession. 
 
                     In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall 
 
                     adhere to the following Code of Ethics. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The Code contains eight Principles related 
 
                     to the behavior of and decisions made by professional software 
 
                     engineers, be they practitioners, educators, managers and 
 
                     supervisors, or policy makers, as well as trainees and students 
 
                     of the profession. The Principles identify the various relationships 
 
                     in which individuals, groups, and organizations participate 
 
                     and the primary obligations within these<br>
 
                     relationships.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Each Principle of this code addresses three 
 
                     levels of ethical obligation owed by professional software 
 
                     engineers in each of these relationships. The first level 
 
                     identified is a set of ethical values, which professional 
 
                     software engineers share with all other human beings by virtue 
 
                     of their humanity. The second level obliges software engineering 
 
                     professionals to more challenging obligations than those required 
 
                     at level one. Level two obligations are required because professionals 
 
                     owe special care to people affected by their work.<br>
 
                     The third and deeper level comprises several obligations which 
 
                     derive directly from elements unique to the professional practice 
 
                     of software engineering. The Clauses of each Principle are 
 
                     illustrations of the various levels of obligation included 
 
                     in that relationship.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The Clauses under each Principle consist 
 
                     of three different types of statement corresponding to each 
 
                     level. Level One: Aspire (to be human); statements of aspiration 
 
                     provide vision and objectives and are intended to direct professional 
 
                     behavior. These directives require significant ethical judgement. 
 
                     Level Two: Expect (to be professional); Statements of expectation 
 
                     express the obligations of all professionals and professional 
 
                     attitudes. Again, they do not describe the specific behavior 
 
                     details, but they clearly indicate professional responsibilities 
 
                     in computing. Level Three: Demand (to use good practices); 
 
                     statements of demand assert more specific behavioral responsibilities 
 
                     within software engineering, which are more closely related 
 
                     to the current state of the art. The range of statements is 
 
                     from the more<br>
 
                     general aspirational statement to specific measurable requirements.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Although all three levels of professional 
 
                     obligation are recognized, the Code is not intended to be 
 
                     all inclusive, nor is it intended that its individual parts 
 
                     be used in isolation to justify errors of omission or commission. 
 
                     The list of Principles and Clauses is not exhaustive, and 
 
                     should not be read as separating the acceptable from the unacceptable 
 
                     in professional conduct in all practical situations. The Code 
 
                     is not a simple ethical algorithm which generates ethical 
 
                     decisions. In some situations standards may conflict with 
 
                     each other or with standards from other sources. These situations 
 
                     require the software engineer to use ethical judgement to 
 
                     act in a manner which is most consistent with the spirit of 
 
                     the Code of Ethics, given the circumstances. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">These ethical tensions can best be addressed 
 
                     by thoughtful consideration of fundamental principles, rather 
 
                     than reliance on detailed regulations. These Principles should 
 
                     influence you to consider broadly who is affected by your 
 
                     work; to examine if you and your colleagues are treating other 
 
                     human beings with due respect; to speculate on how the public 
 
                     would view your decision if they were reasonably well informed; 
 
                     to analyze how the least empowered will be affected by your 
 
                     decision; and to consider if your acts would be considered 
 
                     worthy of the ideal professional working as a software engineer. 
 
                     Since this code represents a consensus of those engaged in 
 
                     the profession one should take into account what is likely 
 
                     to be judged as the most ethical way to act in the circumstances 
 
                     by informed, respected, and experienced peers in possession 
 
                     of all the facts and only depart from such a course for profound 
 
                     reasons, backed with<br>
 
                     careful judgement. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The dynamic and demanding context of software 
 
                     engineering requires a code that is adaptable and relevant 
 
                     to new situations as they occur. However even in this generality, 
 
                     the code provides support for the software engineer who needs 
 
                     to take positive action by documenting the ethical stance 
 
                     of the profession; it provides an ethical foundation to which 
 
                     individuals within teams and the team as a whole can appeal. 
 
                     The code also helps to define those things which are ethically 
 
                     improper to request of an software engineer.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     The code has an educational function, stating what is required 
 
                     of anyone wishing to join or continue in the software engineering 
 
                     community. Because it expresses the consensus of the profession 
 
                     on ethical issues, it can be used as a guide to decision making 
 
                     and as means to educate both the public and aspiring professionals 
 
                     about the professional obligation of all software engineers.</p>
