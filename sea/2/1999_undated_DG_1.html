   Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice -<br>
   Don Gotterbarn <br>
   The ACM and the IEEE-Computer Society have adopted the Software Engineering
   Code of Ethics and Professional Practice(5.2). The Code's development indicates
   a significant agreement about the way software engineers ought to behave and
   the Code is different from other codes in that it provides a variety of mechanisms
   to help the practitioner make ethical judgements. <br>
   The Code was developed by the joint IEEE-CS/ACM task force on Software Engineering
   Ethics and Professional Practice. The composition of the SEEPP task force is
   multinational in both citizenship and in membership in professional computing
   organizations. The development of the Code was an iterative process. The Code
   evolved after extensive study of several existing codes of ethics from computing
   societies, engineering societies and other professions. All of the codes considered:
   try to educate and inspire the members of the professional group that adopts
   the code; inform the public about the responsibilities that are important to
   that profession; instruct practitioners about the standards that society expects
   them to meet, and what their peers strive for and expect of each other. After
   considering the various goals and functions of these codes, SEEPP selected
   various imperatives to be placed in the draft software engineering code. They
   also contributed new imperatives related to their knowledge of software engineering
   and from suggestions of external reviewers. <br>
   The draft Code which was reviewed by members of several professional computing
   societies and went through several revisions. After this process, the Code
   (version3) was printed with a turnaround ballot in the IEEE-CS and the ACM
   flagship magazines. Although most of the clauses in the Code received better
   than a 90% approval rating, several of the returned comments led to the development
   of version 4 of the Code. SEEPP submitted version 4 of the Code for review
   by a panel of peers using the IEEE formal review process for establishing technical
   standards. The Code passed this review and was modified in the light of reviewer's
   comments. The final version of the Code (www-cs.etsu.edu/seeri/secode.htm)
   was approved by the ACM in November and the IEEE-CS in December. I found the
   consistently high level of agreement about the behavior expected of a professional
   software engineer very significant. There is general agreement about our obligations
   as software engineers, even if some software engineers are not able to overcome
   the external pressures not to follow these obligations. <br>
   There are several positive elements to this Code which distinguish it from
   may other codes of professional ethics. Most codes of ethics provide a finite
   list of principles which are often presented as a complete list and the reader
   presumes that only things in the list should be items of ethical concern for
   the professional. In many situations these rules conflict and codes provides
   no guidance as to which principles should have higher priority. This ambiguity
   of priority leaves the ethical decision maker confused. The Software Engineering
   Code address both of these limitations of other codes. <br>
   The Software Engineering Code explicitly rejects the concept of completeness. <br>
 &quot;It is not intended that the individual parts of the Code be used in isolation
 to justify errors of omission or commission. The list of Principles and Clauses
 is not exhaustive. The Clauses should not be read as separating the acceptable
 from the unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical situations. The
 Code is not a simple ethical algorithm which generates ethical decisions.&quot; <br>
   The problem with an incomplete Code is that it leaves us without guidance in
   new situations. To meet this potential difficulty the Software Engineering
   Code provides general guidance for ethical decision making, especially in those
   areas not explicitly mentioned in the Code. <br>
 &quot;Ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful consideration of fundamental
 principles, rather than blind reliance on detailed regulations. These Principles
 should influence software engineers to consider broadly who is affected by their
 work; to examine if they and their colleagues are treating other human beings
 with due respect; to consider how the public, if reasonably well informed, would
 view their decisions; to analyze how the least empowered will be affected by
 their decisions; and to consider whether their acts would be judged worthy of
 the ideal professional working as a software engineer. In all these judgments
 concern for the health, safety and welfare of the public is primary; that is,
 the &quot;Public Interest&quot; is central to this Code.&quot; <br>
   The first principle asks the developer to consider all the stakeholders, not
   just their employer or client. The second principle--due respect--requires
   a protection of human values. This section also addresses the question of equal
   priority of all of the rules by stating that in all decisions the public interest
   is the primary concern. <br>
   To reinforce the clear priority of public concern, in several places the code
   asserts the priority of concern for the public over loyalty to employer or
   profession. It is a professional obligation to take positive action to address
   violations of the Code. <br>
   The Code addresses both the responsibilities of the practicing professional
   and of the profession. It is a positive step because it is not designed to
   be self-serving to the profession. It requires software engineering professionals
   to be ethically responsible to all of those who are effected by their products. </p>
