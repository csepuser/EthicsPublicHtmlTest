                     Subject: objections to Proposed Code of Ethics</p>
 
                   <p>Felipe and Dennis (and Don),</p>
 
                   <p>You have asked ACM SIGSOFT for its comments on the draft 
 
                     Code of 
 
                     Ethics. I have asked my Executive Committee for comments, 
 
                     and I 
 
                     hope some will be forthcoming.</p>
 
                   <p>In any case, I have some of my own comments, which I include 
 
                     below. 
 
                     And, because some of my concerns are (to me at least) quite 
 
                     serious, 
 
                     let me take this opportunity to state clearly that until some 
 
                     of these 
 
                     problems are clarified and/or fixed, that ACM SIGSOFT does 
 
                     *not* 
 
                     endorse this draft code.</p>
 
                   <p>In general, I think that my comments fall into two categories:</p>
 
                   <p> *General comments about ethics (such as financial conflict), 
 
                     where I may be especially naive.</p>
 
                   <p> *Comments about places where I think the code is too naive 
 
                     about some special properties of software and the software 
 
                     industry.</p>
 
                   <p>I'm less worried about the first category than the second 
 
                     because it 
 
                     would, if I am correct, significantly reduce the collection 
 
                     of people 
 
                     that might pay attention to and learn from the proposed code.</p>
 
                   <p>Feel free to pass these comments around as you wish (preferably 
 
                     including this message as context). I suspect that they sound 
 
                     far 
 
                     more negative than they should, but perhaps they will generate 
 
                     some 
 
                     useful improvements.</p>
 
                   <p>David 
 
                     ***** 
 
                     I've just read the draft of the software engineering code 
 
                     of ethics. 
 
                     And, indeed, I have a couple of comments. </p>
 
                   <p>1) There is not a single mention of the issue of modifying 
 
                     or changing 
 
                     existing software. Since this is a significant piece of the 
 
                     industry, 
 
                     the omission is obvious and serious. I don't believe that 
 
                     adding in a 
 
                     few words can handle this easily, either, because in many 
 
                     cases the 
 
                     pressures to make changes without a &quot;full&quot; understanding 
 
                     of the 
 
                     software are real and are reasonable.</p>
 
                   <p>Another take on this is that the ability to change and evolve 
 
                     software 
 
                     is one of the primary characteristics that distinguishes software 
 
                     from 
 
                     other engineering disciplines. If we don't account for the 
 
                     distinguishing characteristics of software, then we can use 
 
                     &quot;any old 
 
                     engineering ethics code.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p>2) My reading is that the code implicitly focuses on contract 
 
                     software, where specifications and design documents play a 
 
                     critical 
 
                     and direct role. However, a significant amount of the industry 
 
                     now 
 
                     works in the shrinkwrap world, where these issues are wildly 
 
                     different. Yes, specification exists. Yes, design exists. 
 
                     But 
 
                     phrases like &quot;satisfy the user's requirements&quot;, 
 
                     &quot;have the client's 
 
                     approval&quot;, &quot;understand fully the specifications 
 
                     for software on which 
 
                     they work&quot;, etc., are at best difficult to interpret 
 
                     and are at worst 
 
                     meaningless.</p>
 
                   <p>3) 1.06 talks about &quot;effective procedures for promotion 
 
                     of quality and 
 
                     reduction of risk.&quot; Seems reasonable, for sure. But what 
 
                     about a 
 
                     situation where a company (quite reasonably) chooses a niche 
 
                     in which 
 
                     their immediate goal is to produce a software product that 
 
                     is likely 
 
                     to be low quality but first on the market? Or what about a 
 
                     company 
 
                     that intentionally takes a high?risk strategy (perhaps, for 
 
                     example, 
 
                     depending on other products that aren't yet completed)? Perhaps 
 
                     situations like these are covered indirectly in the draft 
 
                     code, but I 
 
                     don't believe that this is sufficient.</p>
 
                   <p>4) 1.14 talks about making tradeoffs visible to all parties 
 
                     concerned, 
 
                     including the public. And 6.13 talks about sharing &quot;useful 
 
                     software?related knowledge, inventions, or discoveries with 
 
                     the 
 
                     profession&quot;. If the draft code doesn't make it clear 
 
                     that companies 
 
                     and software engineers have interests???in particular, certain 
 
                     classes 
 
                     of intellectual property???that needn't be disclosed, or that 
 
                     must be 
 
                     disclosed with care, then it will not be of use to many software 
 
                     engineering practitioners. You address this somewhat in Principle 
 
                     4, 
 
                     especially 4.05, but explicitly observing this inherent set 
 
                     of 
 
                     conflicts seems of value.</p>
 
                   <p>5) 1.15 talks about departing from appropriate industry standards 
 
                     &quot;only when technically justified.&quot; How about economically 
 
                     justifications? Even more critical, are there reasonable and 
 
                     sufficient industry standards that apply to most or all areas 
 
                     of 
 
                     software engineering? Safety?critical software? Real?time 
 
                     embedded 
 
                     software? Shrinkwrap software? Operating system software? 
 
                     Transaction processing software? Game and entertainment software? 
 
                     Internet?based software? Etc. If not, is it &quot;ethical&quot; 
 
                     to provide a 
 
                     principle that is unsatisfiable?</p>
 
                   <p>6) 3.07 discusses avoiding financial conflicts of interest. 
 
                     Well, I'm 
 
                     no expert here, but let me give you two examples where such 
 
                     conflict 
 
                     would exist according to 3.07, but where it seems ludicrous. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p> a) I was once on a program committee for a software 
 
                     engineering conference. I was advocating the acceptance of 
 
                     a videotape by a person at a company for a presentation.  
 
                     I was asked by another committee member if I had stock in 
 
                     the company. Well, it turns out I did (I'd guess it was worth 
 
                     under $1500 at the time), although it hadn't occurred to me. 
 
                     Was I unethical? Nope. Was there an appearance of being 
 
                     unethical? Well, perhaps. Would the conference (and the 
 
                     profession) have been better had I recused myself? Surely 
 
                     not. Indeed, given that almost everyone in the community owns 
 
                     mutual funds that own high?tech stocks, I'll wager that this 
 
                     kind of broad &quot;financial interest&quot; conflict would 
 
                     make it all 
 
                     but impossible to make progress in many bodies. </p>
 
                   <p> (Professional standards committees would, I suspect, fall 
 
                     apart entirely. Why? Because all industrial members would, 
 
                     according to 3.07, have an ethical conflict if their employers 
 
                     would benefit from their involvement???and this is, of course, 
 
                     in some sense the primary goal of sending employees to serve 
 
                     on standardization boards.)</p>
 
                   <p> b) The State of Washington has a new and extremely firm 
 
                     ethics 
 
                     code. Hunter Simpson was a member of the state's Information 
 
                     System's Board (ISB), a gubenatorial appointee. He's been 
 
                     CEO 
 
                     of a company or two and is quite wealthy. He owned $9K of 
 
                     IBM 
 
                     stock. He was involved in a (unanimous) decision to award 
 
                     a  
 
                     state contract to IBM. He was ultimately punished by the  
 
                     State Ethics Board for having a conflict of interest. This 
 
                     was (although you might not be able to tell from my brief 
 
                     description) crazy as can be. If applied even more 
 
                     aggressively (easy to believe in our state's case) you could 
 
                      
 
                     imagine situations in which the only people who could sit 
 
                     on 
 
                     the state's ISB are people who have no assets and have no 
 
                      
 
                     knowledge of technology.  
 
                      
 
                     OK, I'm sure that these are not what you had in mind. And 
 
                     I suspect 
 
                     (again) that these kind of &quot;exceptions&quot; are covered 
 
                     elsewhere in the 
 
                     draft. (And I'm sure you have way better examples than mine, 
 
                     since I 
 
                     am confident you've thought about this.) But 3.07 is simply 
 
                     too 
 
                     simplistic, in my opinion.</p>
 
                   <p>7) 6.07 says to &quot;only accept remuneration appropriate 
 
                     to professional 
 
                     qualifications or experience.&quot; Forbes (I think) just 
 
                     printed its list 
 
                     of the top 100 richest people in technology. Many of them 
 
                     got rich 
 
                     essentially as software engineers who started companies. I'd 
 
                     hate to 
 
                     be in the middle of a discussion about whether they are accepted 
 
                     appropriate remuneration.</p>
