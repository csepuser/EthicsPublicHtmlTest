       <p>A plan to identify the body of knowledge of software engineers 
       <p>Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering
                     as a Profession<br>
   Software Engineering Institute, Friday December 10, 1993<br>
   Participants: Mario Barbacci (CMU SEI), Fletcher Buckley (Martin Marietta),
   Elliot Chikofsky<br>
   (Northeastern U. and Radius Systems), Patricia Douglass (IBM Skill Dynamics),
   Gary Ford<br>
   (CMU SEI)<br>
   Additional contributions provided by: William Everett (AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories),
   Marie<br>
   Silverthom (TI), Joan Weszka (IBM FSC)<br>
   1.0 Recommendation<br>
   1.1 The body of knowledge will be defined piece by piece, through surveys.<br>
   1.2 Structures to define body of knowledge<br>
   1.2.1 Categories of components of knowledge (Static knowledge or dynamic knowledge;
   things we do):</p>
                   <p>Generic<br>
   mathematics<br>
   science<br>
   engineering science (analytic tools) engineering design (life cycle)<br>
   Specific to SE<br>
   software analysis software architectures computer systems<br>
   software process (things you do as an engineer)<br>
                   </p>
                   <p>1.2.2 Levels of knowledge (Educational objectives in cognitive
                     domains; how well<br>
   do we do things):<br>
   Knowledge (lowest then moving higher)<br>
   Comprehension<br>
   Application<br>
   Analysis<br>
   Synthesis<br>
   Evaluation (highest)<br>
   1.3 First identify and classify components of knowledge under static/dynamics
   knowl<br>
   edge (primary). Then use level of knowledge (secondary)<br>
   Define list of main categories (e.g., analysis, architecture, systems, process).
   Define<br>
   terms in list. Provide examples<br>
   Identify components of knowledge under each listed category. Limit to a small
   num<br>
   ber of components. Provide definition for each component.<br>
                   </p>

   Surveys might differ across domains. For example, within Software Architectures
   there are many domains. Superdomains also exist, e.g. Embedded systems, Support
   for human activities<br>
   1.5 Survey #1 is to identify components i.e. things all Software Engineers &quot;should<br>
   know&quot; under various categories (static/dynamic knowledge)<br>
   These are 2 questions: know at entry level? Know at expert level?<br>
   Preliminary survey can ask people to review/prioritize and add additional compo<br>
   nents. This preliminary survey is just for debugging the real survey and will
   be lim<br>
   ited to a small group (30 ? 40 participants) to allow confirming survey results
   with<br>
   participants.<br>
   Set aside components that fall below some threshold (votes).<br>
   1.6 Survey #2 is to identify level of knowledge required for components identified
   and<br>
   classified by survey #1.<br>
   Before large ballot, do a test involving a few hundreds of participants that
   agree to<br>
   work with us. Should also ask for comments. Could also do small sampling many<br>
   times before doing the larger sampling.<br>
   After revision, if necessary, conduct mass balloting. Probably thousands of
   partici<br>
   pants.<br>
   Primarily we are concentrating on industry, but any other organizations can
   provide<br>
   input.<br>
   Try to do surveys with different populations from different areas.<br>
   Later surveys? Pick up set?aside components and classify by &quot;domains&quot; Ask
   the question what SE should know now or in 10 years (ideal)<br>
   A plan to identify the body of knowledge of software engineers<br>
   2.0 Expected result from survey 1<br>
   Result from Survey 1 is a table with a list of component above a cut. These
   are topics that all software engineers should know when they first start working
   or after a few years of experience. Topics are clustered under major categories
   (type of knowledge)<br>
                   </p>
                   <p>3.0 Expected result from survey 2<br>
   Result from Survey 2 is an augmented table with the components identified in
     the first survey but now asking for the level of knowledge required at entry
     or after a few years of experience. The levels of knowledge are Knowledge
     (K), Comprehension (C), Application (Ap), Analysis (An), Synthesis (S), and
     Evaluation (E)<br>

   some future time&quot;<br>

   Target to a wide audience of hundredths for test version, thousands for real
   version<br>

   companies<br>
   5.4 Sample Topic for Survey #2<br>
   Levels of knowledge for Software Configuration Management (SCM) topic The Software
   Engineer shall be able to define SCM. The Software Engineer shall be able to
   execute a SCM plan. The Software Engineer shall be able to create a SCM plan.
   The Software Engineer shall be able to participate in CCB. The Software Engineer
   shall be familiar with the use of at least one source of code control system.<br>

   6.0 Resources and Schedule<br>
   6.1 Resources:<br>
   Clerical ? SEI<br>
   Editorial ? SEI + Task Force + Steering Committee + Interested volunteers<br>
   Survey Design/Analysis ? IBM (Pat)<br>
   6.2 Schedule<br>
   6.2.1 Identify survey designers by (1/15/94?)<br>
   6.2.2 Complete literature search (candidate list of components and categories)
   by<br>
   2/ 15/94<br>
   6.2.3<br>
   Identify group to test survey #1 (30 to 40 participants) by 2/15/94<br>
   6.2.4 Draft survey #1 (components of knowledge) by 3/15/94<br>
   6.2.5 Survey designers start work on survey #2 (format, audience, etc.) by
   3/15/94<br>
   6.2.6 Conduct test survey #1 between 3/15/94 and 5/1/94<br>
   6.2.7 Conduct revised survey #1 (hundredths) between 5/1/94 and 6/15/94<br>
   6.2.8 Draft survey #2 (levels of knowledge) by 8/1/94<br>
   6.2.9 Conduct test survey #2 (hundredths) between 10/1/94 and 12/1/94<br>
   6.2.10 Ballot survey #2 (thousands) by 1/1/95<br>
   7.0 Addendum<br>
   The following changes were suggested to the plan after the first draft was
   circulated for comments by the participants at the December 10 meeting. Since
   not all participants have had a chance to comment on the changes they are not
   yet incorporated in the body of the report.<br>
   7.1 Separate the Journeyman/Master levels of expertise. Define a Journeyman
   as a software engineer with 5+ years of experience and a Master as a software
   engineer with 10+ years of experience. During the meeting these two categories
   were lumped<br>
   together (&quot;expert&quot;) for the survey each will have a separate column.<br>
   7.2 Refine survey #1 to ask &quot;when does the software engineer first learns
   the topic&quot;. The original question was ambiguous because an &quot;X&quot; under
   Apprentice would imply<br>
 &quot;X&quot; under the other two levels of experience. In Survey #1 there should
 be at most 1 &quot;X&quot; per topic row. Survey #2 is different because it asks
 for level of knowledged at various levels of experience i.e., there could be
 multiple &quot;X&quot; in a topic row (e.g.,<br>
   Comprehension as Apprentice, Analysis as Journeyman, Evaluation as Master)<br>
   7.3 The schedule sketched at the meeting had errors. Some necessary tasks were
   not included. A revised schedule is shown in the following Gantt chart.<br>
