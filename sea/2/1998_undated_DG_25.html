         Code of Ethics and Professional Practice</p>
       <p align="justify"> Response Council Questions From 10 May Meeting</p>
       <p align="justify"> 1. Is the ACM Code of Ethics compatible with the Software 
         Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice (SECEPP)? </p>
       <p align="justify">COPE has reviewed both codes and found no incompatibility 
         between them. The SECEPP is designed for a sub-specialization of computing. 
         Actions which are in keeping with the SECEPP will also be consistent with 
         the imperatives of the ACM Code. Since the ACM Code is broader than the 
         SECEPP there may be actions taken in accordance with the ACM Code that 
         are outside of the scope of the SECEPP. The two codes are not co-extensive.</p>
       <p align="justify">People are often bound by codes which are overlapping 
         but not co-extensive. For example, university professors are bound by 
         overlapping codes. Some inappropriate actions while communicating with 
         students in the classroom are defined in sexual harassment guidelines 
         but these same actions in the classroom are not within the scope of a 
         university computer use policy.</p>
       <p align="justify">2. What is the relationship between the two codes --the 
         ACM Code and the SECEPP? </p>
       <p align="justify">The SECEPP is not a replacement for either the ACM Code 
         or the IEEE Code. The SECEPP was created under a mandate to professionalize 
         software engineering and the Code is designed as a code for the &#8220;profession&#8221; 
         of software engineering. For example, the details of the Software Engineering 
         Code emphasize standards of software development, management, maintenance 
         and emphasize the impact of the software development process on society. 
         These emphases reflect the design of this code as a software engineering 
         code. The existence of two codes is not abnormal. Professional engineers 
         are governed by at least two professional code --the more generic code 
         of the National Society of Professional Engineers and a more specific 
         code related to the specific details of their particular branch of engineering--chemical, 
         mechanical, etc.</p>
       <p align="justify">3. Define the approval process for the SECEPP. COPE recommends 
         four stages to the approval process. The first three of these stages have 
         been completed. The four stages are: A. Develop and revise the Code based 
         on extensive review. * B. Have the Code Reviewed by the Joint ACM/IEEE-CS 
         Task Force. C. Use an existing and tested formal review process used by 
         the IEEE for approving international technical standards. ** D. Formal 
         adoption of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct 
         (5.1) by the ACM and the Computer Society of the Software Engineering 
         Code of Ethics and Professional Practice as their approved code for the 
         practice and teaching of software engineering.</p>
       <p align="justify">* The Code went through extensive reviews and revision 
         until July 1997 when version was sent to the ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Task Force 
         for review. After review by the Joint Task Force, Version 3 was published 
         in the November issues of CACM and Computer with a turnaround ballot seeking 
         input on each clause of the Code. The responses --most items receiving 
         better than 90% approval-- were used to modify version 3 into version 
         4 which was submitted to the Joint Task Force in December 1997.</p>
       <p align="justify">** Version 4 was then submitted to an independent formal 
         review process. After the identification of a representative balloting 
         group by the IEEE Technical review process, version 4 was reviewed and 
         voted on by this group. Even though version 4 was accepted by this group, 
         preliminary votes and comments were taken into account and used to improve 
         version 4 creating version 5. Version 5 was recirculated for final review 
         by the balloting group and again passed. Some editorial minor editorial 
         point were made about version 5. These were made, generating version 5.1. 
         The version being recommended.</p>
       <p align="justify"></p>
       <p align="justify">&lt;response.doc&gt; COPE Recommendations related to 
         the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice.</p>
       <p align="justify">A. COPE has reviewed the Software Engineering Code of 
         Ethics and Professional Practice (version 5.1) and its development and 
         review process. COPE supports the recommendation by the Joint Task for 
         the Professionalization of Software Engineering for the adoption of the 
         Code by the ACM as their approved Code for the practice and teaching of 
         Software Engineering. </p>
       <p align="justify">The Code represents an international effort by representatives 
         from multiple domains --academe, governments, military, profit and non-profit 
         organizations, private consultants and researchers. The Code reflects 
         the international flavor of the ACM and of the heterogensous nature of 
         software engineering. Because of the involvement of multiple socieities, 
         the Software Engineering Code has benefited from a review process which 
         was more extensive than the review process for the current ACM Code. The 
         adoption of this Code would be a positive step for the ACM and software 
         engineering.</p>
       <p align="justify">B. Both the ACM and the Computer Society have recognized 
         that codes of ethics are only effective if they are known about by the 
         memberships. To meet this and other needs the ACM established COPE. The 
         Computer Society has a similar support and education organization. Software 
         Engineering is an emerging profession and as an emerging profession there 
         is an even greater need to educate aspiring and practicing software engineers 
         about their obligations. Given software engineering&#8217;s emergent character, 
         there is also a need to educate those effected by the products of software 
         engieering about their rights. &#8220;The Code is not simply for adjudicating 
         the nature of questionable acts; it also has an important educational 
         function. As this Code expresses the consensus of the profession on ethical 
         issues, it is a means to educate both the public and aspiring professionals 
         about the ethical obligations of all software engineers.&#8221; (Preamble 
         to SECEPP)</p>
       <p align="justify"> To meet this need for education and maintenance COPE 
         recommends the establishment of an ACMC/Computer Society jointly sponsored 
         and supported Software Engineering Professionalism and Ethics Committee 
         (SEPEC) as a standing committee within the Joint Software Engineering 
         Coordinating Committee. This recommendation has the support of the Joint 
         Steering Committee for the Professionalization of Software Engineering.

       <p align="justify"> * Under the a National Science foundation grant, 3 interactive 
         CD&#8217;s about computer ethics are under development by the Research 
         Center for Computing and Society (RCCS). One of those CD&#8217;s &#8220;Professional 
         Responsibility&#8221; is nearing completion and deals extensively with 
         the ACM Code of Ethics. The RCCS has agreed to supply these CDs at cost 
         for distribution to ACM members. These CDs could be included in ACM membernet 
         and distributed with the CACM. See www.emr.org/products/pr1.html for a 
         description of this product.</p>
       <p align="justify"> ** Several major industries have established ethics 
         divisions which are charged with educating their employees about ethics 
         related to their work. One of the tools they use in this educational process 
         is a wallet card. The wallet card contains a brief statement of the companies 
         ethical positions on one side and a brief guide to ethical decision making 
         on the other side. Such a card would help keep members mindful of their 
         obligations and give guidance in making decisions. </p>
