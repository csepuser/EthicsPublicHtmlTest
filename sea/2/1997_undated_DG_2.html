                   <p>Principle 3: JUDGMENT. </p>
 
                   <p>Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, (1) 
 
                     promote and protect both the independence of their professional 
 
                     judgment and 
 
                     their reputation for such judgment. In particular, software 
 
                     engineers shall, as 
 
                     appropriate:</p>
 
                   <p> 3.01 Maintain professional (2)objectivity with respect to 
 
                     any software or related documents they are asked to evaluate. 
 
                     (3) 2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared 
 
                     under their supervision and within their areas of competence. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>3.02. Reject bribery. </p>
 
                   <p>3.03. Accept no payback, kickback, or other payment from 
 
                     a third party to a contract, except with the knowledge and 
 
                     consent of all parties to the contract. </p>
 
                   <p>3.04. Accept payment from only one party for any particular 
 
                     project, or for services (4)specific to that project, except 
 
                     when the circumstances have been fully disclosed to the parties 
 
                     concerned and they have given their informed consent. (5) 
 
                     3.07. Disclose to all concerned parties those conflicts of 
 
                     interest that cannot reasonably be avoided or escaped (6) 
 
                     and aspire to resolve them. </p>
 
                   <p>(7) DELETED 3.05. Neither solicit nor accept a contract from 
 
                     a governmental body on which a principal or officer of their 
 
                     employer serves as a member. </p>
 
                   <p>3.06. (7a) Participate in no decision of a governmental or 
 
                     professional body, as a member or advisor, concerned with 
 
                     software, or related documents, in which they, their employer, 
 
                     or their client have a financial interest. (8) need additional 
 
                     SOCIAL clauses..................???? (8a) Judgement about 
 
                     when to blow the whistle- relate to 4.05 ================== 
 
                     4================ </p>
 
                   <p>This Principle talks about obligations between client and 
 
                     employer and emphasizes loyalty and not harming the other 
 
                     party unless required by concerns of public health, safety, 
 
                     and welfare. If this list is viewed as exclusive than it would 
 
                     seem we can &quot;sell a computer to Hitler&quot; since it 
 
                     will only be used to discriminate against a particular group. 
 
                     We need to fill out the list or make clear that it is not 
 
                     exhaustive. ????????</p>
 
                   <p>PRINCIPLE 4: CLIENT AND EMPLOYER. </p>
 
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
 
                   <p>Software engineers shall, consistent with the public health, 
 
                     safety, and welfare, always act in professional matters as 
 
                     faithful agents and trustees of their client or employer. 
 
                     In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
 
                   <p> 4.01. Provide service only in areas of competence. </p>
 
                   <p>4.02. Assure that any document upon which they rely has been 
 
                     approved by someone (9)authorized to approve it. </p>
 
                   <p>4.03. Use the property of a client or employer only in ways 
 
                     properly authorized(10), and with the client's or employer's 
 
                     knowledge and consent.</p>
 
                   <p>4.04. Not knowingly use (11) illegally obtained software 
 
                     on equipment of a client or employer or in work performed 
 
                     for a client or employer. </p>
 
                   <p>4.05. Keep as confidential information gained in their professional 
 
                     work that is not (12) in the public domain (13)and is not 
 
                     inconsistent with matters of public concern. </p>
 
                   <p>4.06. Identify, document, (14) and report to employer or 
 
                     client any problem(15)s or matters of social concern in the 
 
                     software or related documents on which they work (16) or of 
 
                     which they are aware. </p>
 
                   <p>4.07. Inform the client or the employer promptly if, in their 
 
                     opinion, a project is likely to fail, to prove too expensive, 
 
                     to violate (17)intellectual property legislation, in particular 
 
                     copyright , patent, and trademarks, or otherwise (18) be problematic. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>4.08. Accept no outside work detrimental to the work they 
 
                     perform for their primary employer. </p>
 
                   <p>4.09 Unless ethical considerations demand otherwise, an employee 
 
                     shall represent no interest adverse to their employer's without 
 
                     the employer's specific consent (19).</p>
 
                   <p>Explanation of modifications to Principles 3 and 4</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 3 talks about professional judgement. After clause 
 
                     3.01 which states 
 
                     the need for objective judgement, clause 3.02 through clause 
 
                     3.07 SECE v1.0 
 
                     dealt with the elimination of one type of external influence 
 
                     on judgement, 
 
                     specifically financial interference with objective judgement. 
 
                     Other pressures on 
 
                     objective judgement, e.g., political, and social, are not 
 
                     yet addressed in this 
 
                     principle. We should ask the task force for specific contributions 
 
                     here????????.</p>
 
                   <p>1. add 'promote and' to Principle 3 because as stated it 
 
                     simply indicates that we should merely try to hang on to professional 
 
                     judgement. </p>
 
                   <p>2 replace 'skepticism' with 'objectivity', the latter being 
 
                     a less negative sentiment </p>
 
                   <p>3 move 2.30 to here, reflecting a specific type of significant 
 
                     judgement.</p>
 
                   <p> 4 replace 'related' with 'specific' . Ruling out related 
 
                     services means that a SE could not develop an area of work, 
 
                     like a specialty in radar systems, and then market that skill 
 
                     (which is related to a single product) to others. </p>
 
                   <p>5 Reorganize principles 3.05-3.07 which deal with conflict 
 
                     of interest. Start with Principle 3.07 and expand 3.07 to 
 
                     address the objection &quot;that conflict of interest issues 
 
                     can be managed in a variety of ways and do not require complete 
 
                     exclusion&quot;. </p>
 
                   <p>6 Add 'and aspire to resolve them' to meet a concern with 
 
                     complete exclusion as the only way to address conflict of 
 
                     interest. </p>
 
                   <p>7. Delete clause 3.05. This clause says that the SE should 
 
                     not behave in a way which might bring about this particular 
 
                     type of conflict of interest. It presupposes that absolute 
 
                     exclusion is the only way to address conflicts of interest. 
 
                     This presumption is inconsistent with the modification suggested 
 
                     for 3.07. This clause would, for example, rule out a member 
 
                     of the IEEE Board of Governours advocating the development 
 
                     of a funded task force which addresses an issue in that member's 
 
                     own specialization. 7a The discussion of this is that it may 
 
                     be as restrictive as 3.05 and is still in need of modification. 
 
                     ??????? ????? </p>
 
                   <p>8 Missing clauses under this principle - As this clause stands 
 
                     judgement is merely a technical thing and does not involve 
 
                     social issues. Some examples mght be:</p>
 
                   <p> Only make judgements which can be publicly justified as 
 
                     being in the 
 
                     best interest of quality of life, and the environment.</p>
 
                   <p> Be aware that all technical judgements impact other human 
 
                     beings. They  
 
                     have stakeholders other than employers, clients, and users.</p>
 
                   <p> All technical judgements should be tempered and guided by 
 
                     the need to 
 
                     support and maintain human values. </p>
 
                   <p>9 replace 'qualified' with ' authorized'. This avoids questions 
 
                     of how one determines qualification-competence.</p>
 
                   <p> 10 add ', and with the client or employers knowledge and 
 
                     consent.'</p>
 
                   <p> 11 replace pirated with a less idiomatic term, namely &quot;illegally 
 
                     obtained&quot;. </p>
 
                   <p>12 delete word 'properly'</p>
 
                   <p> 13 add 'and is not inconsistent with matters of public concern' 
 
                     because as originally stated, if someone concentrated on the 
 
                     clause 4.05 alone they might think it prohibits whistle blowing.</p>
 
                   <p> 14 replace 'properly'</p>
 
                   <p> 15 add 'or matters of social concern' because someone might 
 
                     interpret 'problems' as referring exclusively to code bugs. 
 
                     This addition helps define the social responsibility of a 
 
                     professional software engineer.</p>
 
                   <p> 16 add 'or of which they are aware' to clarify the broader 
 
                     responsibility of a professional to the whole of society. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>17 replace 'violate copyright laws' with ' intellectual property 
 
                     legislation, in particular copyright , patent, and trademarks' 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>18 Change the expression 'turn out badly to &quot; be problematic&quot;</p>
 
                   <p> 19. Insert &quot;unless ethical considerations demand otherwise, 
 
                     since as stated it would be unethical to whistle blow unless 
 
                     the employer consents. </p>
