                     Comments and corrrections appreciated.<br>
 
                     I will sent you the results of the survey on Wednesday. </div>
 
                   <p align="justify"></p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Dear David,<br>
 
                     Thank you for your careful evaluation of the draft Software 
 
                     Engineering Code of Ethics v3.0. I am sorry for the delay 
 
                     in getting back to you but I wanted to clear my response to 
 
                     your concerns with the rest of the committee that has been 
 
                     working on the Code.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">We are getting responses from the publication 
 
                     of the Code and survey in the Communications of the ACM and 
 
                     in Computer, so some of our responses to your coments incorporate 
 
                     responses to other comments on the Code.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">You are right that we did not specifically 
 
                     mention maintenance in the Code because the committee viewed 
 
                     maintenance as another type of development, another way in 
 
                     which systems evolve. We believe modification of software 
 
                     requires the same care and responsibility as does the original 
 
                     development of the software. As you know, many forms of maintenance 
 
                     involve the development of new subsystems and significant 
 
                     regression testing. We are also aware of the unfortunate circumstance 
 
                     you alluded to where some developers treat maintenance as 
 
                     a mindless exercise. We don't want this to be a standard advocated 
 
                     in the Code. A Code needs to be aspirational if we are to 
 
                     achieve a minimum acceptable standard from all professionals 
 
                     and it will also differentiate professionals from opportunists.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In our effort to emphasize the importance 
 
                     of maintenance by applying the same standards of professional 
 
                     responsibility to maintenance as new development we failed 
 
                     to explicitly mention the relation. We are adding a specific 
 
                     statement that will make clear that the term &#8220;development&#8221; 
 
                     for the software engineer includes new development, enhancement 
 
                     of existing systems and correction of existing system. <br>
 
                     HELP GUYS!!<br>
 
                     TARGET SENTENCE. WHAT DO YOU THINK AND WHERE CAN WE PUT SOMETHING 
 
                     LIKE THIS?<br>
 
                     &#8220;Software engineering is unique in the amount of time 
 
                     spent in maintaining and modifying existing software. This 
 
                     the flexibility and maliability of software systems places 
 
                     special burdens on the software engineer to treat software 
 
                     modification with the same professionalism as new development.&#8221; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In case this statement is missed, we have 
 
                     specifically added references to maintenance in the following 
 
                     places:<br>
 
                     In the Preamble:<br>
 
                     &quot;Those who contribute, by direct participation or by 
 
                     teaching, to the design, development, and maintenance of software 
 
                     systems have significant opportunities both to do good and 
 
                     to cause harm and to influence and enable others to do good 
 
                     or cause harm. &quot;.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">&quot; To assure, as much as possible, that 
 
                     this power will be used for good, software engineers must 
 
                     commit themselves to making the design, development and maintenance 
 
                     of software a beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance 
 
                     with that commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the 
 
                     following Code of ethics.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In Principle 8<br>
 
                     &quot;8.01. Further their knowledge of developments in the 
 
                     design, development, maintenance and testing of software and 
 
                     related documents, together with the management of the development 
 
                     process&quot;</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Even under pressure, the professional doing 
 
                     maintenance must: understand the needed change, design the 
 
                     change, implement and test the change and make sure that the 
 
                     change had no unexpected side effects.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">You are right that sometimes maintenance 
 
                     is treated as second class development and people take the 
 
                     dangerous step of modifying software that they do not understand. 
 
                     One of the functions of a Code of ethics is to provide standards 
 
                     of practice that people should aspire toward, so we did not 
 
                     feel that the &#8220;second class development&#8221; approach 
 
                     to software maintenance should be supported or advocated in 
 
                     a code of good practice.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Your second comment about &#8220;shrink wrapped 
 
                     software&#8221;development for the market, rather than development 
 
                     for a specific client was right on the mark. The development 
 
                     process is different here because the developer him/herself 
 
                     becomes the client. We are going to stipulate a &quot;client&quot; 
 
                     for shrink wrapped software: the person or persons who must 
 
                     be satisfied before the product is shipped. There is a concern 
 
                     that a shrink wrapped client may agree to software that is 
 
                     damaging in some way to some users in the community. Those 
 
                     potentially effected by this client&#8217;s acceptance need 
 
                     to be informed. Development of systems with risks are unavoidable 
 
                     and acceptable, but only when the affected parties are able 
 
                     to choose that risk. Disclaimers on such software would be 
 
                     required. Contractual bargains must be explicit. This also 
 
                     addresses your third point about those who &#8220;choose a 
 
                     niche in which their immediate goal is to produce a software 
 
                     product that is likely to be low quality but first on the 
 
                     market &#8220; It is true that many companies try to keep 
 
                     these levels of risk and low quality a secret. But this behavior 
 
                     is viewed as unprofessional. Doctors perform operations which 
 
                     pose different degrees of threat to their patients but the 
 
                     doctor must reveal the level of risk and secure informed consent. 
 
                     &#8220;This was the point of 1.14. Promote maximum quality 
 
                     and minimum cost to the employer, the client, the user and 
 
                     the public. Make any tradeoffs clear to all parties concerned.&#8221; 
 
                     We do understand that in any software development there will 
 
                     be trade-offs; but the professional is obliged to make these 
 
                     clear. Look at the reactions to the Intel Pentium fiasco.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The next two points are straightforward to 
 
                     fix.<br>
 
                     Thank you. Point 4 is right on the mark. 6.15 sharing &quot;useful 
 
                     software?related knowledge, inventions, or discoveries with 
 
                     the profession&quot; is in need of clarification.. A qualification 
 
                     of 6.15 is needed respecting rights of the third parties and 
 
                     confidentiality. We are also adding a caveat about not violating 
 
                     or causing loss of trade secrets, competitive disadvantage 
 
                     etc. This will also be cross referenced to 4.05</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Point 5 asks in regard to 1.15 &#8220;Are 
 
                     there reasonable and sufficient industry standards that apply 
 
                     to most or all areas of software engineering? &#8220; We struggled 
 
                     with this. We know there are different standards for data 
 
                     processing and real time systems. Unfortunately some developers 
 
                     generalize from the existence of different standards to &#8220;there 
 
                     are NO standards&quot;. We tried to cover the fact that there 
 
                     are different standards with the word &#8216; appropriate&#8217; 
 
                     in 1.15. One of the things that make standards appropriate 
 
                     is the domain of application, shrink wrap software, real-time 
 
                     etc. There is also the problem that there may be no best standard 
 
                     for a particular domain.<br>
 
                     1.15 &#8220; Work to follow industry standards that are most 
 
                     appropriate for the task at hand, departing from these only 
 
                     when technically justified.&#8221; </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">will be changed to </p>

                   <p align="justify"><br>
 
                     Point 6 refers to the conflict of interest clause in 3.07. 
 
                     Your concern with the absolute prohibitions of 3.07 was shared 
 
                     by others who commented on the Code. People who commented 
 
                     on that clause also had concern that restricting the statement 
 
                     to &quot;financial interest&quot; likely misses other important 
 
                     &quot;interests.&quot; The intent of the conflict of interest 
 
                     clause was that potential conflicts of interest be revealed 
 
                     and addressed in ways acceptable to the customer. So we have 
 
                     deleted 3.07. The intent of 3.07 is contained in 3.06 in a 
 
                     way which one avoids undisclosed potential conflicts. The 
 
                     point is to include something about divulging potential conflicts 
 
                     of interest and seeking agreement from affected parties and 
 
                     that this is ok prior to the decision making. If not then 
 
                     they have to cease their involvement. I think it is a case 
 
                     of transparency. Nevertheless, 3.07 is gone.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     Your last comment was about 6.07 which says to &quot;only 
 
                     accept remuneration appropriate to professional qualifications 
 
                     or experience.&quot; The intent of this was to eliminate implicit 
 
                     bribes. It would be better stated as &quot;never take inflated 
 
                     wages when you know it is a bribe.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Thank you for your comments they have helped 
 
                     to improve the Code. We received very few comments from the 
 
                     publication of an earlier version in SIGSoft this summer.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Our committee is meeting in early December 
 
                     to put the finishing touches on the Code. If you have any 
 
                     further comments we would appreciate seeing them.</p>
