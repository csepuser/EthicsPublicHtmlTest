       <p>Dear Don:
       <p><br>
   This responds to your e-nail of December 8 seeking comments on the Version
     4.0 of the SE Code. My overall comments is that, very soon, it should be
     gone over by a good editor. Committees have a tendency to garble text, to
     introduce unnecessarily clumsy modes of expression, and otherwise to make
     the code more difficult to use than need be.<br>
   My comments will suggest what 1 have in mind (as well as my virtually complete
   satisfaction with the Code&quot;s substance).<br>
   Short versions intro (and corresponding provisions in main code). Note transition
   from &quot;must&quot; in line one to &quot;shall&quot; in line 5. Whatever
   point the transition is supposed to make is too subtle for me. I recommend
   using &quot;shall&quot; in both (since &quot;must&quot; sounds too much like
   banging on the table).</p>
       <p><br>
         1. Public. 1 think it enough if engineers always act &quot;consistent with&quot; the
   public interest. To require them always to act &quot;in the public interest&quot; is
   to forbid them to do good for themselves, their clients or employers, and even
   their customers when doing that is neutral with respect to the public interest.
   Surely, not what was intended (or what 2 says).<br>
   2. Client or employer. &quot;within confines of&quot;. Dead metaphor. Presumably,
   it means the same as the shorter (and more common) &quot;consistent with&quot;.<br>
   3. Product. &quot;their products and related modifications&quot;. Modifications
   are generally<br>
   modifications of something. if of products, they are products. If of something
   else, what?<br>
   Frankly. &quot;modifications&quot; just strikes me as confusing. Enough about
   the basic principles. You get the idea. Now to the document. </p>
       <p>Preamble. This long enough that it might be a good idea to name the
         paragraphs (say, with letters rather than numbers) to aid in reference..</p>
       <p>Preamble. First paragraph. Line 5. &quot;opportunities both to do good
         or to cause harm, and to influence and enable others to do good or cause
         harm'&quot;. How about something grammatically easier to follow, e.g. &quot;opportunities
         to do good or cause harm, to enable others to do good or cause harm,
         or to influence others to do good or cause harm&quot;. Better yet: &quot;opportunities
         to do good or cause harm directly or indirectly&quot;. Best&quot; &quot;opportunities
         to do good or cause harm&quot; (since &quot;cause&quot; allows for everything
         else anyway).</p>
       <p><br>
   Preamble. Third paragraph. Third last line. &quot;ethical judgment&quot;. Actually,
   you should want them to use judgment, not just ethical judgment. What do you
   gain by adding &quot;ethical&quot; here when you go on to say &quot;in the
   spirit of the Code&quot;?<br>
   Next para. last three lines. &quot;these judgments concerns delete s[ for
   the health. safety. and welfare of the public is the primary concern (delete &quot;the&quot; and &quot;concern&quot;).
   That is [insert J the 'Public Interest' is central to this code. [delete this
   entire last sentence as entirely redundant, enough to say public health, safety,
   and welfare are primary fifth para. Lines 3-4. &quot;support for the [delete &quot;the'&quot;]
   software engineer [add &quot;s'&quot;I and managers of software engineers who
   need [delete &quot;s&quot;J&quot; . Switch from singular to plural so confusing
   drafter mess up verb ending. Simplify. sixth para. third line. &quot;it is
   as means&quot;. &quot;A means&quot;?</p>
       <p><br>
   2.02. &quot;illegally or unethically&quot;. If &quot;unethically&quot; means &quot;in
   violation of this code&quot;. it would be clearer to say so. If it means something
   else, then might be good idea to say what. Right now it is just confusing. </p>
       <p>2.06. Insert &quot;to&quot; after &quot;otherwise&quot; to make consistent
         with &quot;likely to ....'&quot;<br>
   3.02 &quot;on which they work or [add &quot;which they&quot; I propose.<br>
   3.14. &quot;data [add &quot;,&quot;I being sensitive to outdated or flawed
    occurrences.&quot; Outdated what? What is a &quot;flawed occurrence&quot;?
   Unless this is a technical term, might be better to speak of corrupted data
   or something
   means something to your reader?<br>
   3.15. &quot;professionalism&quot;. Is this a synonym for &quot;care'&quot;?
   If so, why not use &quot;care'&quot;. If something more is intended, why not
   say what?<br>
   4.114. &quot;[shall[ Do not engage.&quot; one modal is enough. drop &quot;Do&quot;.
   is bribery a &quot;deceptive financial practice`&quot;? What if the bribery
   is open'? might be better to say &quot;not engage ill bribery. double billing,
   or other improper financial practices. I omit &quot;secret payments&quot; since
   some--for example. those involving national security, might not be improper.<br>
   4.05. &quot;and aspire to resolve them&quot;. &quot;Them&quot; refers to &quot;conflicts
   of interest that cannot reasonably be avoided or escaped&quot;. Why would anyone
   want to aspire to resolving one of them? Or should i aspire to resolve it by
   unreasonably avoiding or escaping it? So. what I does the aspire phrase add
   but confusion?.Principle 5. last line. &quot;managing and leading&quot;. Substitute &quot;or&quot;.
   Surely, one ,,,ants what follows to be done by someone who only managed or
   led.<br>
   5.08. &quot;suitably qualified&quot;. Is it possible to be qualified but in
   a way not suitable? what does &quot;suitably&quot; add except confusion.<br>
   6.09. &quot;and the subsequent ramifications.&quot; what does this mean? Amendments?
   Interpretations? Effects? Why not say?<br>
   6.13. &quot;when consultation about the problem has proven impossible, dangerous,
   or ineffective.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Consultation&quot; seems the wrong word here. People get paid to consult.
 More serious, do you really want someone to wait to go to appropriate authorities
 until the &quot;consultation has proven... DANGEROUS&quot;?<br>
   7.05. &quot;passwords, tiles, security measures in general, and other confidential
   information&quot;. A security measure is not &quot;confidential information&quot;.
   Can you just drop &quot;security measures in general&quot; or rewrite the whole
   paragraph?<br>
   8.02 &quot;safe, reliable, and useful quality software&quot;. What does &quot;quality&quot; add?
   is the fear that the software could be safe, reliable, and useful and yet lack
   quality?<br>
   8:07 and 8:08 belong under Principle 7, that is, they both concern colleagues.
   not self.<br>
   Well, those are my favorite candidates for wordsmithing. No doubt others will
   have theirs.</p>
       <p><br>
   Sincerely,<br>
   Michael Davis</p>

   PS: Thanks for the comments. I'll use them, as soon as I get time. I believe
     the instructions for getting &quot;your archive&quot; was in your e-mail
     describing how to use the list server. But I haven't had time to check that
     either. Will do over break.</p>
