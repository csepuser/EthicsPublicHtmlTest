                   <p align="justify"> I am glad that the Code of Ethics is being 
 
                     revisited, and its scope expanded beyond the ACM. This is, 
 
                     I know, difficult and often thankless work, but it's necessary 
 
                     if organizations like ACM and IEEE/CS are to become true governing 
 
                     bodies of the profession. The alternative ?? governmental 
 
                     certification and licensing ?? is far worse, and I'm convinced 
 
                     that the time is fast approaching when we will have to demonstrate 
 
                     the ability to govern ourselves or be subjected to the heavy 
 
                     hand of Big Brother.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> That said, I have deep-seated reservations
                     
 
                     about several provisions of the current Draft, and I hope
                     
 
                     that the Executive Committee contemplates a complete rework
                     
 
                     after comments are re? ceived. In its current state, this
                     
 
                     Draft is nowhere near ready for release.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Perhaps my most fundamental reservation 
 
                     has to do with the fact that no enforcement mechanisms are 
 
                     prescribed. As the Pre? amble suggests, ethics is not an exact 
 
                     science; it's a subjec? tive matter, and no enumeration of 
 
                     &quot;principles&quot; can transform it into an objective 
 
                     discipline. Codes of ethics are not state? ments on the nature 
 
                     of abstract &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;; rather, 
 
                     they are statements of feelings shared by certain individuals 
 
                     at certain points in time. This Draft attempts to describe 
 
                     how members of ACM and IEEE/CS feel about professional standards 
 
                     in the year 1997. The reason for making it a public document 
 
                     is to give laypersons some idea of what those feelings are, 
 
                     and thus of what they can expect when dealing with a professional 
 
                     in the field of software engineering.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> If a code of ethics is to have any meaning 
 
                     at all, it must offer remedies to people who believe it has 
 
                     been violated, and the only appropriate way to claim such 
 
                     remedies is to appeal to the authority which promulgated the 
 
                     code. In this case, such an appeal would be made to ACM, IEEE/CS, 
 
                     or another professional society subscribing to the code. The 
 
                     disciplinary tools at the disposal of such societies range 
 
                     from warnings and reprimands to suspension or expulsion. Organizations 
 
                     use these tools, and subscribe to codes of ethics, because 
 
                     they seek to assure the public that their members will act 
 
                     in certain ways, and that those who do not will lose their 
 
                     standing as members. Such as? surances are the alternative 
 
                     to governmental regulation.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> At the very minimum, therefore, the code 
 
                     must require of subscribing organizations that they maintain 
 
                     a compliance body charged with receiving and evaluating complaints 
 
                     against their members. To ensure fairness, basic procedural 
 
                     safeguards should also be outlined.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> For the sake of discussion, let me offer 
 
                     the proposal of inserting a new Principle, &quot;Governing 
 
                     Bodies,&quot; between existing Principles 7 and 8. The inclusion 
 
                     of such a Principle would make it clear that we, as software 
 
                     professionals, consider ourselves uniquely qualified to govern 
 
                     our own, and that we are asserting our intention to do so. 
 
                     The new Principle would deal with the relationship of subscribing 
 
                     organizations to the code, and of members to their governing 
 
                     organizations. It would set forth the basic obligations on 
 
                     both sides, including the obligation of professional organizations 
 
                     to evaluate complaints against their members and the right 
 
                     of members to be judged by impar? tial peers.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> I realize that addressing these matters 
 
                     will necessitate a substantial amount of rework, and I deeply 
 
                     regret it. However, by the terms of its own charter, the Committee 
 
                     really cannot avoid dealing with the issue of enforcement. 
 
                     The original joint steering committee was charged with establishing 
 
                     &quot;appropriate set(s) of standards for professional practice
 
                     of software engineering upon which industrial decisions,
                     
 
                     professional certi? fication, and educational curricula can
 
                     be based.&quot; Certifica? tion presupposes some means of 
 
                     enforcement. Speaking to you as colleagues and fellow professionals, 
 
                     I assure you that failure to make provision for enforcement 
 
                     will result in a code which is essentially irrelevant and 
 
                     universally perceived as such. Consequently, it will do nothing 
 
                     to avert, and may even invite, external regulation of a sort 
 
                     none of us wants.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> It will not do to say that enforcement
                     provisions 
 
                     can be left to the subscribing organizations. If our goal
                     
 
                     is to formu? late standards of professional conduct applicable
                     
 
                     to the entire range of software practice -- and that should
                     
 
                     be our goal -- we must insist on a uniform interpretation
                     
 
                     of those standards. If we do not, the code will be interpreted
                     
 
                     by the various organizations in ways which diverge over
                     
 
                     time, eventually resulting in a muddle of conflicting precedents.
                     
 
                     For this reason, my own preference would be to remove complaint
                     
 
                     proceedings from the jurisdiction of the subscribing organizations
                     
 
                     by requiring a multi-organizational composition for all panels
                     
 
                     of inquiry. Of course, the code of ethics itself need not
                     
 
                     delve into such procedural details, but it must set forth
                     
 
                     the general guidelines for its own enforcement.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> With regard to complaints against professionals,
 
                     I'm sure that many respondents will join me in expressing
 
                     concern about Clause 7.07. This clause appears intended to
 
                     offer protection against discrimination on the basis of factors
 
                     unrelated to competence, but if that's the case, the Committee
 
                     should explicitly say so. (In fact, I find no language condemning
 
                     such discrimination anywhere in the Draft, and I consider
 
                     that to be a serious omission.) The specific problem with
 
                     7.07 is that it could foster the kind of tacit &quot;code 
 
                     of silence&quot; sometimes associated with physicians and 
 
                     police officers ?? a code which discourages members of the 
 
                     profession from testifying against each other. I'm sure you'll 
 
                     agree that we do not want to dis? courage the prompt identification 
 
                     of incompetent practitioners, or practitioners operating outside 
 
                     their field of competence. Nobody is in a better position 
 
                     to do this than colleagues ?? indeed, they do so now, as a 
 
                     matter of common (if informal) practice. At the very least, 
 
                     therefore, 7.07 should be amended to read something like this:</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Not interfere in the professional career 
 
                     progression of any colleague, except in cases where concern 
 
                     for client or public welfare causes a professional to question 
 
                     the competence of a colleague for the work being performed.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> It might also be desirable to insert language 
 
                     encouraging the resolution of incompetence cases between colleagues, 
 
                     or be? tween professionals and their clients, making it clear 
 
                     that ap? peal to the governing body is to be regarded as a 
 
                     last resort.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Because a code of ethics is about expectations
                     
 
                     rather than abstract notions of good and bad, I would rewrite
                     
 
                     the Preamble to eliminate vague references to &quot;good.&quot; 
 
                     This is not, after all, a doctrinal creed for a religious
                     
 
                     body, but a document reflecting the current state of informed
                     
 
                     thought about optimal practices in the field of software
                     
 
                     engineering. We should make it clear to the public -- and
                     
 
                     no less to our own colleagues--  that compliance with the
                     
 
                     code is not a matter of morality, but a matter of professionalism
                     
 
                     carrying explicit assurances to the public and explicit consequences
                     
 
                     for violators.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> I find Clause 6.01 troublesome. Does this
 
                     mean that a competent practitioner who happens to be a Stalinist
 
                     or a member of the Ku Klux Klan forfeits professional standing?
 
                     Perhaps we really do want to make that determination, but
 
                     if so it must be very explicit, and the proscribed affiliations
 
                     must be clearly spelled out. As a practical matter, it makes
 
                     more sense to condemn actions than to condemn affiliations,
 
                     e.g., a theoretical Stalinist may practice, whereas a Pol
 
                     Pot would be considered worthy of expulsion.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> A more mundane reading of 6.01 -- and one
                     
 
                     the Committee probably intended -- would restrict its applicability
                     
 
                     to deal? ings in the course of doing business, so that, for
                     
 
                     example, a professional would decline to deal with a firm
                     
 
                     known to produce defective software. But this distinction
                     
 
                     must be made explicit. As it stands, 6.01 is too vague to
                     
 
                     offer any useful guidance.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Descending to the level of the technical, 
 
                     I'm extremely uncomfortable with Clause 1.12. Perhaps elaboration 
 
                     would make its intent clearer, but as it stands it encourages 
 
                     dangerous practices. To begin with, of course, it's seldom 
 
                     unequivocally clear to a practitioner that a particular element 
 
                     of data is &quot;outdated,&quot; or even &quot;flawed.&quot; 
 
                     Only the owner of the data can make that determination, and 
 
                     then only with competent technical advice from a professional. 
 
                     Even if the owner of the data deems it outdated or flawed, 
 
                     it's seldom good practice to delete data altogether, because 
 
                     such decisions are irrevocable and not in? frequently regretted. 
 
                     The more prudent course is to &quot;comment out&quot; obsolete 
 
                     data if possible, or move it offline to backup media.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> I think perhaps the Committee meant to address 
 
                     a very real concern about privacy. The proliferation of databases 
 
                     contain? ing extensive personal information concerns all of 
 
                     us, and the code should explicitly encourage extreme caution 
 
                     in the collec? tion and use of such data, even, perhaps, to 
 
                     the extent of pro? hibiting the participation of professionals 
 
                     in the collection of personal data which is not properly safeguarded. 
 
                     But that is a different issue. The code must simultaneously 
 
                     foster two things: Utmost respect for the privacy of those 
 
                     about whom per? sonal data is collected, and a high degree 
 
                     of respect for the rights of the owners of data. Each of these 
 
                     is sufficiently im? portant to warrant a Clause of its own.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Finally, a few nits. (There are more, but 
 
                     I don't want to exhaust your patience.)</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> The wording in 1.11 is awkward. I suggest:</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Take care to use only accurate data derived 
 
                     by lawful means, and to use it only in ways authorized by 
 
                     the owner of the data.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> (It's a fine point, but &quot;lawful means&quot; 
 
                     is preferable to &quot;legal sources&quot; in this context.)</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Passive voice is awkward in 4.09. I suggest:</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Represent no interest adverse to their employer's 
 
                     without the employer's specific consent, unless a higher ethical 
 
                     concern is being compromised; and in that case, inform the 
 
                     employer or another appro? priate authority of the engineer's 
 
                     ethical concern.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> The authors of the Draft have attempted
                     
 
                     to avoid the generic masculine by resorting to the plural.
                     
 
                     Now, I dislike the generic masculine as much as anyone, not
                     
 
                     so much because it's politically incorrect as because it's
                     
 
                     inaccurate. However, I've found that the best substitute
                     is 
 
                     the second person singular, which has the advantages of being
                     
 
                     simple, accurate, and direct. &quot;Software engineers shall
                     
 
                     ensure that they are qualified...&quot; sounds sterile and
                     
 
                     remote, as if it applies to someone else. &quot;As a software
                     
 
                     engineer, you shall ensure...&quot; commands much more attention.
                     
 
                     I recommend recasting the entire document in the second person.</p>
