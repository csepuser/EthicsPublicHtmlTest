                   <p> ITS TIME TO GET BACK TO WORK :-)</p>
 
                   <p>My overall feeling is that if we are getting the high levels 
 
                     of approval that we are, we should:</p>
 
                   <p> 1) be wary of making changes that some who currently approve 
 
                     of the code might disapprove of; </p>
 
                   <p>2) be wary of major new develpments such as stating the principles 
 
                     in a 'stand alone' manner. </p>
 
                   <p>I presume from your comments that NONE of the clauses had 
 
                     majority disapproval. </p>
 
                   <p> *SIZE</p>
 
                   <p> One of the common complaints is the size of the code. </p>
 
                   <p>I think 5.02 could be removed as being too technical. </p>
 
                   <p> Following the ACM model. I suggest that we take the Eight 
 
                     keyword</p>
 
                   <p>Principles and expand then by a word or three so that they 
 
                     could stand on their own.</p>
 
                   <p>As expressed above, I am wary of this, but think it would 
 
                     be OK **provided** we make it clear that they are only extracted 
 
                     from the full code, and should never be used on their own, 
 
                     or quoted without a reminder that they are extracted from 
 
                     the full code. </p>
 
                   <p>Everyone? </p>
 
                   <p>---- WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT NOW - MODIFICATIONS OF - THE 
 
                     8 PRINCIPLES.</p>
 
                   <p>I would prefer them to be perfectly unaltered, *including* 
 
                     the part sentences starting &quot;In particular...&quot; which 
 
                     help make the principles abundently clear as being only a 
 
                     short version of the whole code. </p>
 
                   <p>If they must be changed... </p>
 
                   <p>Principle 1: PRODUCT.</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, ensure that 
 
                     the software on which they work is useful and of acceptable 
 
                     quality to the public (including by respecting privacy and 
 
                     being ethically, economically, culturally and environmentally 
 
                     sensitive), the employer, the client, and the user; completed 
 
                     on time and at reasonable cost; and free of error. In particular,

                   <p> Software engineers shall, in their professional role, act 
 
                     only in ways consistent with public and environmental safety, 
 
                     health and welfare, and is sensitive to the differences between 
 
                     people. In particular, software engineers shall ...</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 3: JUDGMENT</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, insofar as possible and consistent 
 
                     with Principle 2, protect both the independence of their professional 
 
                     judgment and their reputation for such judgment. In particular, 
 
                     software engineers shall, as appropriate ... (ie as was) </p>
 
                   <p>PRINCIPLE 4: CLIENT AND EMPLOYER.</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, consistent with the public health, 
 
                     safety, and welfare, always act in professional matters as 
 
                     faithful agents and trustees of their client or employer, 
 
                     including by identifying, documenting, and reporting to them 
 
                     problems or matters of social concern in the software. In 
 
                     particular, software engineers shall... </p>
 
                   <p>Principle 5 MANAGEMENT. </p>
 
                   <p>A software engineer in a management or leadership capacity 
 
                     shall act fairly and shall enable and encourage those who 
 
                     they lead to meet their own and collective obligations, including 
 
                     those under this code. In particular, those software engineers 
 
                     in leadership roles shall as appropriate... (ie as was)</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 6: PROFESSION. </p>
 
                   <p>Software engineers shall, in all professional matters, advance 
 
                     both the integrity and reputation of their profession as is 
 
                     consistent with public health, safety, and welfare, including 
 
                     by promoting honesty. In particular, software engineers shall,

                   <p>Principle 7: COLLEAGUES.</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall treat all those with whom they 
 
                     work fairly, take positive steps to support collegial activities, 
 
                     and call on others for assistance when needed. In particular,

                   <p>Software engineers shall, throughout their career, strive 
 
                     to enhance their own ability to practice their profession 
 
                     as it should be practiced, and support this code. In particular,

                   <p>TESTING VERSUS GOOD DESIGN Where are there places where we 
 
                     might balance out the emphasis on good testing with elements 
 
                     of quality design? We should be able to add a word or two 
 
                     to a clauses and add this element.</p>
 
                   <p>GOOD DESIGN IS _IMPLICIT_ IN MANY OF THE EXISTING CLAUSES 
 
                     (eg 1.01-1.08 inclusive, 1.10 1.13-1.15, 2.05, 2.07, 2.09, 
 
                     3.03, 3.04, 3.06?3.08, 4.01, 4.06-4.08, 5.03, etc, 8.01?8.02, 
 
                     8.04 etc - On any or all of these, the words &quot;As a contribution 
 
                     to good design of software&quot; could be added at the start. 
 
                     1.01-1.05, 1.15, 8.01?8.02, 8.04 are *more* appropriate for 
 
                     this treatment than the others, if it is needed to make it 
 
                     more explicit - some of the others could loose some of their 
 
                     meaning if the phrase were added). </p>
 
                   <p> 1.0x * Refuse to work for or approve projects where the 
 
                     working conditions under which the project was produced are, 
 
                     in the engineer's opinion, likely to lead to unacceptably 
 
                     high risks to the public or the client's safety.[40a]</p>
 
                   <p>Looks like a good addition, now I have slightly modified 
 
                     the ending. </p>
 
                   <p> 1.07. Ensure realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, personnel, 
 
                     and outcome on any project on which they work or propose to 
 
                     work and provide a risk assessment of these estimates I like 
 
                     the idea of replacing with: &quot;only &quot; take part in 
 
                     projects with the time and resources assigned to make it possible 
 
                     to do a good job.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>[4i] 1.11. Be careful to use only accurate data derived from 
 
                     legal INSERT and ethical sources, and use only in ways properly 
 
                     authorized.</p>
 
                   <p>1.12. Whenever appropriate, delete outdated or flawed data 
 
                     REMOVE, OR REPLACE WITH &quot;Promote understanding and awareness 
 
                     of the quality of the data management issues that surround 
 
                     the data that affect the product.&quot; [10i]</p>
 
                   <p> 1.14. Promote maximum quality and minimum cost to the employer, 
 
                     the client, the user and the public. Make any tradeoffs clear 
 
                     to all parties concerned. 1.14 INSERT IN 2ND SENTENCE: &quot;significant&quot; 
 
                     [2i] </p>
 
                   <p>1.15. Work to follow industry standards that are most appropriate 
 
                     &gt; for the task at hand, departing from these only when 
 
                     technically &gt; justified</p>
 
                   <p>drop the word &quot;technically&quot; [2i]</p>
 
                   <p>2.05. Endeavor to produce software that respects diversity. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Issues of language, different abilities, physical access, 
 
                     mental access, economic advantage, and allocation of resources 
 
                     should all be considered </p>
 
                   <p>2.05 The specific text of clause 2.05 contains a puzzling 
 
                     term &quot; mental access,&quot; as opposed to (?) Or (?) 
 
                     physical access.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>See earlier email. </p>
 
                   <p>Today &quot;diversity&quot; is used to cover approval of 
 
                     actions with which I strongly disagree. How about the more 
 
                     neutral &quot;differences&quot;? [42a]</p>
 
                   <p>I could cope with this change, but would have to think very 
 
                     hard about attatching my name to the code if 2.05 were deleted. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>3.08. Temper all technical judgements by the need to support 
 
                     and maintain human values. </p>
 
                   <p>3.08 I prefer &quot;good&quot; or &quot;uplifting&quot; values? 
 
                     [42a] </p>
 
                   <p> 4.04. Not knowingly use illegally obtained or retained software.</p>
 
                   <p>I prefer ADDING </p>
 
                   <p> 4.04 &quot;unethically&quot;[13a] So 4.04. Not knowingly

                     or unethical means. </p>
 
                   <p> 5.0x The following looks like a worthy addition. </p>
 
                   <p> An additional item that might be needed is to: Ensure that 
 
                     coders are given, in sufficient quantities, time and resources, 
 
                     to complete documentation. [20a]</p>
 
                   <p>Similarly: 5.0x * Not punish software engineers informing 
 
                     leadership of problems in the project (as mentioned in clause 
 
                     4.07 of this code) </p>
 
                   <p> 5.01. Ensure that employees are informed of standards before 
 
                     being held to them.</p>
 
                   <p>Improved by this re?wording:</p>
 
                   <p> &quot;Ensure there is a fair and reasonable standard of 
 
                     performance, and ensure that employees are informed of them 
 
                     before being held to them.&quot;[42a]</p>
 
                   <p> 6.07. Only accept remuneration appropriate to professional 
 
                     qualifications or experience.</p>
 
                   <p>I STRONGLY SUPPORT 6.07 AND WOULD ARGUE FOR ITS RETENTION. 
 
                     THE DIFFICULTIES LISTED ARE USUALLY ADDRESSED BY THE SUBTLETY 
 
                     OF THE WORDING.</p>
 
                   <p>7.02. Review the work of other software engineers, which 
 
                     is not in the public domain, only with their prior knowledge, 
 
                     provided this is consistent with public health, safety, and 
 
                     welfare. 7.02 SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT ON WORDING: &quot;only with 
 
                     proper authorization&quot; [42a] </p>
 
                   <p> 7.08. Not undermine another software engineer's job prospects 
 
                     for one's own personal gain. </p>
 
                   <p>7.08 I am concerned about the wording here ?? note the survey 
 
                     sheet says &quot;Do no pursue a job offered to a colleague&quot; 
 
                     ?? if that sort of &quot;agree not to compete&quot; meaning 
 
                     is intended, then I oppose this. </p>
 
                   <p>COULD THAT WORDING ON THE SURVEY SHEET ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGH 
 
                     DISAPPROVAL, RATHER THAN ANY REAL WORRIES WITH THE REAL WORDING?</p>
 
                   <p>&quot;Not undermine with false, distorted, or irrelevant 
 
                     information another SE's job prospects ...&quot;? [42a] WOULD 
 
                     BE OK INSTEAD. </p>
 
                   <p></p>
 
                   <p>I hope all of these comments are a help rather than a hinderance.
