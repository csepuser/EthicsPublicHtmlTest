       <p align="center">CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS v1.0 September
         1996</p>
       <p align="center">PREAMBLE</p>
       <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, industry,
         government, medicine, entertainment, and ordinary life. Because the utility
         of computers depends in large part on the instructions written for them,
         those who design, develop, and test software have enormous opportunities
         both to do good and to cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, that
         this power will be used for good, software engineers commit themselves
         to making the design, development, and &gt;pp&gt; must or shall commit
         themselves testing of software a distinct, beneficial, and respected
         profession. In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall
         adhere to the following standards of conduct. The seven main paragraphs
         state general rules. Each subsidiary clause is a specific application
         of its general rule, one experience has shown needs express statement;
         but no set of subsidiary clauses exhausts the general rule.</p>
       <p>&gt;df The previous sentence makes no sense to me: &gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; General
         disclaimer saying we cannot give all instances of a rule in ethics.</p>
       <p align="center"></p>
       <p align="center">STANDARD OF CONDUCT</p>
       <p> The standards set out below explain how the Code of Ethics applies
         to member's professional work. The list of standards is not necessarily
         exhaustive, and should not be read as definitively demarking the acceptable
         from the unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical situations
         faced by a member. The intention of the Standard of Conduct is to illustrate,
         and to explain in more detail, the mean of the Code of Ethics in terms
         of specific behaviours. However, the mere fact that a member engages
         in, or does not engage in, these behaviours does not of itself guarantee
         that a member is acting ethically, or unethically, respectively.</p>
       <p> The ACS accepts that the standards are ideal, and many not all be achievable
         at all times in all circumstances. In practice, a member may occasionally
         find that some standards conflict with other standards, including standards
         from other sources. On these occasions the member must weight up the
         relevant factors and choose to act in the manner which is most consistent
         with the Codes of Ethics, given the circumstances. It is not possible
         to set totally objective standards about ethical conduct, and this Standard
         does not attempt to do so. The delineation of ethical and unethical behaviour
         requires some element of subjectivity. A member is expected to take into
         account the spirit of the entire Code in order to resolve ambiguous or
         contentious issues concerning ethical conduct.</p>
       <p align="center">USE A PUBLIC STANDARD</p>
       <p> In the final analysis the member is answerable to other members in
         jointly determining what is ethical and what is not in particular. In
         summary, a member is expected to act at all times in a manner likely
         to be judged by informed, respected, and experienced peers in possession
         of all of the facts as the most ethical way to act in the circumstances.</p>
       <p align="center">Preamble.</p>
       <p> Commitment to ethical professional conduct is expected of every member
         (voting members, associate members, and student members) of the Association
         for Computing Machinery (ACM). This Code, consisting of 24 imperatives
         formulated as statements of personal responsibility, identifies the elements
         of such a commitment. It contains many, but not all, issues professionals
         are likely to face. Section 1 outlines fundamental ethical considerations,
         while Section 2 addresses additional, more specific considerations of
         professional conduct. Statements in Section 3 pertain more specifically
         to individuals who have a leadership role, whether in the workplace or
         in a volunteer capacity such as with organizations like ACM. Principles
         involving compliance with this Code are given in Section 4. The Code
         shall be supplemented by a set of Guidelines, which provide explanation
         to assist members in dealing with the various issues contained in the
         Code. It is expected that the Guidelines will be changed more frequently
         than the Code. </p>
       <p>The Code and its supplemented Guidelines are intended to serve as a
         basis for ethical decision making in the conduct of professional work.
         Secondarily, they may serve as a basis for judging the merit of a formal
         complaint pertaining to violation of professional ethical standards.
         It should be noted that although computing is not mentioned in the imperatives
         of section 1.0, the Code is concerned with how these fundamental imperatives
         apply to one's conduct as a computing professional. These imperatives
         are expressed in a general form to emphasize that ethical principles
         which apply to computer ethics are derived from more general ethical
         principles. </p>
       <p>It is understood that some words and phrases in a code of ethics are
         subject to varying interpretations, and that any ethical principle may
         conflict with other ethical principles in specific situations. Questions
         related to ethical conflicts can best be answered by thoughtful consideration
         of fundamental principles, rather than reliance on detailed regulations.</p>
       <p> The British Computer Society sets the professional standards of competence,
         conduct and ethical practice for computing in the United Kingdom. The
         Society was incorporated by Royal Charter in July 1984.</p>
       <p>Employers, clients, members of the public or other professions should
         expect, and be encouraged to expect, the same standards of competence
         and conduct from members of The British Computer Society as they expect
         from recognised members of any other profession such as doctors, lawyers
         or architects. Professional Institutions maintain this esteem by two
         principal means. </p>
       <p>They set standards of technical capability which their members must
         satisfy, and they prescribe standards of conduct to which their members
         must conform or be held accountable for any lapse. Both competence and
         accountability should be the hallmarks of members of a professional institution.
         The BCS's contribution to the raising of standards of technical competence
         in the Information Systems community has been very visible for many years.
         The Society believes that there should be equal awareness of the accountability
         of its members not only to possess but to exercise that competence consistently
         according to high standards of personal integrity.</p>
       <p> It is for this reason that Council decided not only to have a thorough
         revision made of the Society's Code of Conduct to ensure that it remains
         adequate and relevant to contemporary needs, but to give it widespread
         publicity so that the public at large know what standards to expect of
         our members. The new Code is the result of much hard work by the Professional
         Advisory Committee, who are themselves experienced practitioners who
         will themselves need to live up to the Code, and are also responsible
         for the work of others from whom they will expect similar standards.
         It is also the product of consultation both within and beyond the Information
         Systems community.</p>
       <p> It therefore deserves recognition on its merits quite apart from the
         fact that it is now, by resolution of Council, the Code of Conduct which
         we are all under an obligation to observe. </p>
