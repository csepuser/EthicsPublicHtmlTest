       <p align="center"><strong> DRAFT 1/26/99</strong></p>
       <p align="center"> <strong>You are Part of the Ethics Team<br>
   Dell Computer Corporation</strong><br>
   <br>
   Your Responsibility as a Dell Employee</p>
       <p align="justify">As a PSG professional you have influence over product
         development activities at Dell and must be aware of the temptations presented
         to you and rise above them. Your business behavior must be above reproach
         and suspicion to ensure Dell&#8217;s continued success as a company known
         for the highest integrity.</p>
       <p align="justify">We have a serious problem if your actions are perceived
         as unethical.</p>
       <p align="justify">If you know or suspect the occurrence of any unethical
         actions, report them to the appropriate Dell personnel. Start with you
         manager unless he or she in involved in the suspected activity, in which
         case you should contact Dell&#8217;s legal department or Compliance Office
         (1-888-888-9975).</p>
       <p align="justify">Stand Tall and Resist Temptation</p>
       <p align="justify">Dell has built a solid reputation as a company that
         maintains the highest of ethical standards. You must distinguish between
         behavior that is acceptable and that which is not. When appropriate,
         say &#8220;no&#8221; and ask questions until the correct actions are
         clear. You are an important part of the Dell team and are responsible
         for maintaining Dell&#8217;s good reputation.</p>
       <p align="justify">This booklet is limited in scope and does not cover
         all of Dell&#8217;s Code of Conduct. Rather it focuses on the primary
         principles that apply to the PSG Professional. Of course, you are responsible
         for abiding by the entire Code of Conduct and any other Dell policies
         and practices.</p>
       <p align="justify">Don&#8217;t be Trapped!</p>
       <p align="justify">You are a target for temptation when you commit Dell
         funds or influence the commitment of Dell funds. Dell&#8217;s business
         partners will attempt to influence your decisions and cause you to show
         preference for their products and services.</p>
       <p align="justify">Resist such temptations when a business partner tries
         to ply you with gifts and favors. Base business decisions on product
         quality, competitive pricing, delivery, and provider reputation. Dell
         understands that in the course of business, you will establish relationships
         with business partners. Nonetheless, you must maintain a businesslike
         relationship with the highest degree of integrity.</p>
       <p align="justify">Your practices will determine the success of Dell&#8217;s
         relationships with its business partners and customers. This booklet
         highlights the standards of conduct Dell expects of you.</p>

   How Shall I Act as a PSG Professional?</p>
       <p align="justify">PSG engineering and program management staff should
         strive to attain the highest professional standard of performance.</p>
       <p align="justify">Engineering and program management staff shall hold
         paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public in the performance
         of their professional duties. Any issue regarding product safety and
         regulatory compliance must be reprinted to the Dell Regulatory Group
         and be ___?____ through the product safety organization.</p>
       <p align="justify">All PSG Professionals should continue to expand this
         professional development and must provide opportunities for career development
         for their staff engineers under their supervisor.</p>
       <p align="justify">Engineering and program management staff should undertake
         the product development tasks for others only if qualified by training
         and experience, or after full disclosure of pertinent limitations.</p>
       <p align="justify">Engineers and program management staff shall seek out,
         accept and offer honest criticism of technical analysis and work, and
         shall forthrightly acknowledge and correct error and credit properly
         the contributions of others.</p>
       <p align="justify">Canon of Ethics for Product Planning and the PrP Process</p>
       <p align="justify">Product engineering and program management staff shall
         ensure that their products and related modifications are of the highest
         professional standard possible. In particular, product personnel shall:</p>
       <p align="justify">a) use best effort for high quality, acceptable cost
         and a reasonable schedule, ensuring that trade-offs are communicated
         to upper management;<br>
   b) strive to identify, define, and address ethical, cultural, legal, and environmental
   issues related to work projects;<br>
   c) work to follow industry standard when available that are best appropriate
   for the task at hand, departing from these only when technically justified;<br>
   d) strive to fully understand the specifications for the program;<br>
   e) ensure that the specifications are well documented and satisfy the business
   contract and have appropriate approvals;<br>
   f) ensure realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, personnel and __?___ of
   any project and provide a risk assessment of these estimates;<br>
   g) ensure adequate testing and review of the product;<br>
   h) use only accurate data derived by ethical and lawful means and used only
   in ways properly authorized;<br>
   i) maintain the integrity of data.</p>
       <p align="justify">Acceptable and Unacceptable Behavior</p>
       <p align="justify">Your relationship with business partners must be arms-length
         and well documented. While negotiation with business partners, base your
         decisions on measurable and sound business judgment.</p>
       <p align="justify">Undue favoritism and preferential treatment are unacceptable
         behaviors, which compromise Dell&#8217;s reputation.</p>
       <p align="justify">Accepting favors is not permitted. This is a two-way
         street; you may not give favors to business partners and you may not
         accept favors from them.</p>
       <p align="justify">Accepting gifts of an influencing nature, complimentary
         services and non-public discounts on personal supplies or services violate
         Dell policy and practice. This prohibition includes trips and other entertainment
         not reciprocal in nature and not directly related to Dell business.</p>
       <p align="justify">If you receive a gift with a value greater than $50,
         you are to return it to the vendor and explain Dell&#8217;s policy regarding
         gifts. Be pleasant and professional, but firm.</p>
       <p align="justify">Investments in business partners (Conflicts of Interest)</p>
       <p align="justify">Keep separate any personal and business activities that
         my give rise to a conflict of interest. Specifically, you may not have
         a financial interest, hold a position or have a relationship with any
         person, firm or company that conducts business with Dell if that could
         influence your decisions as a PSG professional.</p>
       <p align="justify">If you hold shares in a publicly traded company which
         supplies products or services to Dell, that interest cannot exceed 1%
         of the value of the outstanding stock or 1% of the series or class of
         securities. If your interest exceeds those amounts, you may not participate
         in any business decision regarding that supplier. Also you must advise
         your manager or vice president that you have a potential conflict of
         interest. If Dell deems your interest significant enough to warrant a
         change, you may be reassigned to different duties.</p>
       <p align="justify">If the company in question is privately held, you must
         report any interest or position held in that company to your manager
         or vice president. Again, if Dell deems your interest significant enough
         to warrant a change of assignment, you may find that your duties change
         as a result of this interest. This includes warrants and stock options
         for companies which have not yet gone public.</p>
       <p align="justify">This rule applies to your spouse, children, significant
         other or any other relationship which may influence your decision. When
         unsure, discuss the situation with your manager or the Dell Legal Department.</p>
       <p align="justify"></p>
       <p align="justify">Document Your Relationship</p>
       <p align="justify">One way to avoid disputes with business partners is
         to meticulously document meetings and phone conversations. This also
         serves to provide a record for other Dell employees who may need to understand
         our history with a business partner. Therefore, after meetings and phone
         conversations, take the time to make appropriate notes of the conversation
         with special emphasis on action items resulting from the discussion.
         Dell&#8217;s reputation can depend on our meeting any commitments which
         arise out of our continued relationships with our partners.</p>
       <p align="justify">Also, be very careful about your use of electronic mail
         with business partners. It is easy to become too informal in your communications
         using this method. An electronic mail may, in some instances, be used
         as evidence against Dell in a dispute. Accordingly, read your mail carefully
         before sending it to a business partner to ensure that it does not commit
         Dell to something unintended by you, or which conflicts with Dell&#8217;s
         underlying agreement with the partner.</p>
       <p align="justify">{Intel-specific mention?}</p>
       <p align="justify">Especially important is to recognize that when you make
         verbal commitments or requests to partners, those partners may act and
         commit resources which could involve financial exposure to Dell. Therefore,
         you should be sure to explain to the partner that you will be following
         the conversation with a written memorandum or letter agreement which
         sets out the arrangement prior to Dell being bound by any verbal commitment.
         Then be sure to contact Dell&#8217;s Legal Department in a timely manner
         to work out the necessary agreements or other memoranda of your intended
         arrangement.</p>
       <p align="justify">And remember, all contracts with business partners require
         legal review and approval.</p>
       <p align="justify">Your Relationship with Partners</p>
       <p align="justify">Your relationship with partners should be cordial but
         definitely businesslike. All communications should be coordinated with
         WW Procurement. Be objective and exercise sound judgment in decision
         making. Base your relationship on mutual respect and integrity. PSG employees
         are not authorized to make procurement decisions!</p>
       <p align="justify">You may give a business partner Dell promotional items
         in the course of normal business activities. Token gifts should be of
         nominal value and given to help maintain a friendly and professional
         relationship.</p>
       <p align="justify">So, what may you accept? Business partner gifts of pens,
         huggies, cups, notepads, key chains, etc. may be accepted. These gifts
         should not be of value to influence you.</p>
       <p align="justify">Again, an acceptable gift may not exceed a market value
         of $50. If you are unsure of the gift&#8217;s value, return the gift
         promptly and politely to the vendor and explain Dell&#8217;s policy.</p>
       <p align="justify">Dell discourages PSG professionals from routinely attending
         meals with suppliers or business partners unless the meal visits Dell&#8217;s
         site, Dell should pick up the tab for the meal. If you visit a partner
         it is acceptable to allow the supplier to host the lunch or dinner.</p>
       <p align="justify">PSG professionals should not regularly participate in
         non-business related activities such as golf outing, sports events, and
         concerts. Remember, maintain an arms-length relationship with Dell&#8217;s
         partners and avoid the temptations to be unduly influenced.</p>
       <p align="justify">If you are invited to attend entertainment which is
         not part of a legitimate business meeting, you must obtain the prior
         approval of a Director or Vice President in your department. Vice Presidents
         and Directors must use sound judgment in deciding whether to attend or
         to approve participation in such an event.</p>
       <p align="justify">Confidential Information</p>
       <p align="justify">Know what &#8220;confidential information&#8221; is
         and do not disclose it to those who should hot have access. This rule
         applies to both Dell and partner information that is confidential.</p>
       <p align="justify">On occasion, partners will tell you proprietary information
         about their company. You must respect the confidential nature of such
         information and keep it to yourself. Discussing confidential information
         with inappropriate people is a violation of Dell policy and could be
         a violation of law.</p>
       <p align="justify">When you suspect that information provided to you may
         be confidential, encourage the supplier to mark the information appropriately.</p>
       <p align="justify">Also, be vigilant regarding your disclosure of Dell&#8217;s
         confidential information to suppliers. Pricing, volumes, product road
         maps, specifications and drawings are only a few examples of Dell confidential
         information. Disclose confidential information only when there is a valid
         and compelling business reason to do so, and only to those suppliers
         with whom Dell has a valid and effective Nondisclosure Agreement.</p>
       <p align="justify">{Intel Section?}</p>
       <p align="justify">Standards Setting Activities</p>
       <p align="justify">Engineers and Program Managers who are engaged in standard
         setting activities must take special care in avoiding legal problems
         involving antitrust concerns and other anti competitive issues.</p>
       <p align="justify">Specifically, engineers and program managers must avoid
         any standard setting activities which are a detriment to industry participants.</p>
       <p align="justify">In addition, Dell has adopted strict guidelines regarding
         standard setting activities which are available on the legal home page
         at inside.dell.com.</p>
       <p align="justify">Software Privacy</p>
       <p align="justify">Dell strives to enforce and abide by all of its contractual
         commitments to its suppliers and vendors. Dell recognizes that software
         belonging to our suppliers is their intellectual property. Accordingly,
         it is Dell&#8217;s policy that all employees not knowingly use software
         that is obtained or retained either illegally or unethically. Engineers
         and program managers bear a special responsibility for ensuring that
         policy is adhered to.</p>
       <p align="justify">Engineers and Program Management staff who become involved
         in standard setting activities shall refrain from invitations or becoming
         involved in decisions regarding:</p>
       <p align="justify">&middot; the establishment of industry-wide prices terms
         and conditions of sale or marketing policies;<br>
 &middot; allocations of customers, markets, or productions quotas;<br>
 &middot; proprietary designs or productions methods without appropriate notice
 or ___?_____<br>
   of rights; or impositions of sanctions on competitor suppliers or customers.
   SES members who anticipate in standardization activities where such subjects
   are mentioned should take immediate action to terminate any discussion concerning
   these subjects. If such discussion is not terminated the SES members should
   announce their concern and immediately leave the meeting. SES members should
   have the proper regard for the safety, health and welfare of the public in
   the performance of their professional duties. If an engineering judgment is
   overruled by a non-technical authority, the member should clearly point out
   the consequences. An SES member should notify the proper authority of any observed
   condition which provides the potential for endangering public safety or health.</p>
       <p align="justify">Moonlighting</p>
       <p align="justify">Employees of PSG any not moonlight without first receiving
         written permission from their supervisor. Moonlighting may cause the
         inadvertent release of confidential information and the distraction of
         the employee from his primary duties.</p>
       <p align="justify">Traveling Abroad</p>
       <p align="justify">When you travel, you will find that business ethics
         of persons in other countries may differ from those in your country.
         Dell expects its employees to adhere to the spirit of the standards in
         this book wherever they may go. Nevertheless, there may be instances
         where you will find that exceptions must be made in order to avoid insult
         or spoiling a valued relationship.</p>
       <p align="justify">For example:</p>
       <p align="justify">&middot; When you are in a foreign country, you will
         often find that parties wish to host a dinner in your honor. It is impractical
         and often insulting to your host if you refuse to attend. Therefore,
         it is permissible to attend a dinner; however, try to avoid more than
         one such dinner for each visit.<br>
 &middot; Gifts are often given when you visit partners overseas. If you receive
 a gift that is promotional in nature (i.e. has the supplier&#8217;s name or logo),
 you are not obligated to return the gift (you are never allowed to solicit such
 a gift, however). If you are given a gift which is not promotional in nature
 and clearly exceeds the $50 limit described above, or if the gift consists of
 the supplier&#8217;s product (i.e. software, a modem, etc.), use your judgment.
 If the gift is so valuable that it is clearly a bribe or attempt to sway your
 opinion, return the gift immediately and report the event to your manager. Otherwise,
 for gifts which are clearly given as a matter of course and, in your reasonable
 opinion, returning the gift would insult your host, accept it graciously. Then,
 when you return, give the gift to your manager with a report of the circumstances.
 The gift will be regarded as Dell property and disposed of appropriately.<br>
 &middot; In some countries your host will suggest entertainment that would not
 be appropriate in your country or which would violate Dell&#8217;s policy against
 sexual discrimination or harassment. This includes nightclubs with adult entertainment,
 and entertainment where either women or men are not included because of their
 gender. If you are personally uncomfortable with your host&#8217;s suggestions
 for entertainment or if the entertainment would be inappropriate in its sexual
 or other content such that it would violate Dell&#8217;s policy against sexual
 discrimination and/or harassment, explain Dell&#8217;s policy to your host and
 request an alternative.<br>
 &middot; In some countries people will indulge in evening social activities which
 involve a significant amount of alcohol and very late nights. Remember that you
 are always a representative of Dell, even when you are traveling, and your demeanor,
 even during social events, is closely watched by representatives of your suppliers.
 The excessive use of alcohol can result not only in embarrassing you and Dell,
 but can also lead to an inadvertent disclosure of information which should not
 be in the hands of our suppliers.</p>
       <p align="justify">Etiquette</p>
       <p align="justify">As a representative of Dell, you are expected to use
         appropriate etiquette when dealing with partners. This includes avoiding
         the pitfall of denigrating the products of others. Although you may,
         from time to time, find yourself confronted with a partner who disparages
         a competitor&#8217;s product (either your competitor or the partner&#8217;s
         competitor) you should avoid taking part in such a conversation.</p>
       <p align="justify">Objective comparisons are permissible, if they are based
         on factual and readily proven data. Subjective comments and insults are
         unnecessary and unproductive. In extreme circumstances such comments
         could create legal liability for Dell and for you!</p>
       <p align="justify">Law and Regulations</p>
       <p align="justify">Dell is committed to the strict observance of laws and
         regulations of the townships, states and countries in which we do business.</p>
