       <p>Dear Working Group Members:
       <p>I appreciate your patience in getting to work on this important project.
         There were several meetings in February related to the work of the task
         forces and I am now optimistic that the work of our task force will be
         a significant contribution to the entire project on the professionalization
         of software engineering. It has been so long since we first solicited
         your support that I will provide some reminders of the large picture
         and how our working group fits in it.</p>
       <p>The process started in 1993 when both the ACM and the IEEE-CS started
         initiatives related to software engineering. By the end of 1993 there
         was a joint set of recommendations from the two societies.' These recommendations
         included three tasks, each assigned to a different task force --TO DEFINE
         THE REQUIRED BODY OF KNOWLEDGE, TO DEFINE EDUCATIONAL CURRICULA, and
         TO DEFINE ETHICAL STANDARDS.</p>
       <p>Initial formation and planning for the third task force took place in
         Spring and Summer of 1994. In October of 1994, the Joint IEEE Computer
         Society / ACM Project on Software Engineering: Ethical and Professional
         Standards of Practice published a call for participation. </p>
       <p>The purpose of SEEPP is given in that call: The purpose of the SEEPP
         task force is to document the international consensus for minimally acceptable
         ethical/professional responsibilities and obligations of software engineers.</p>
       <p>The scope is given as: </p>
       <p>1.0 SCOPE <br>
         The standards to be established shall document generally accepted principles
           for identifying and resolving ethical conflicts relevant to the discipline
           of software engineering. Consideration shall be given to the responsibilities
           and obligations of the Software Engineer to peers and laypersons, employer,
           customer(s), the profession and society/humanity. Additionally, consideration
           shall be similarly given to the obligations and responsibilities of
           these various entities towards the Software Engineer.</p>
       <p>1.1 GLOBAL APPLICATION<br>
   The SEEPP task force recognizes that the design, development and application
     of software often transcend national boundaries. We feel that it is vitally
     important that the global computing community have the means to insure that
     this project produces a product which is as reflective of the global computing
     community's wisdom as can be reasonably achieved. The participation of individuals
     from throughout the world is important to achieving this goal.</p>
       <p>These standards are intended to document the consensus of the global
         software engineering community. From time to time, consensus on an issue
         may not be clearly recognized. Accordingly, these standards shall also
         document various recommended practices and guidelines when no clear consensus
         can be established.</p>
       <p>* OUR WORKING GROUP: Later in the call, there was this description for
         our working group:<br>
   Professional Competence<br>
   Chair: Donald Gotterbarn<br>
   d.gotterbarn@computer.org</p>
       <p>truth about skill, obligation to keep<br>
   current, truth about code, what should<br>
   be produced? (end-use consequences),<br>
   keep staff current, appropriate knowledge<br>
   base, non- generalization of expertise,<br>
   educational issues: certification, registration,<br>
   and licensure</p>
       <p>* At a meeting of the various SEEPP working group leaders we developed
         a general approach to getting the work of the task force started. To
         get the material to work with we should begin by brainstorming via email
         about what standards we can discover and articulate that have to do with
         standards of professional competence. We have an email list prfcmp-1@utkvml.utk.edu.
         You can access this simply by using an automatic reply to this message.
         The ideal is that what you enter will be seen by others and fertilize
         their ideas. To help encourage contributions, for the first few passes
         of information please expend your efforts expanding on what others say
         and reserve your critical comments for a later date when I have organized
         most of the inputs and redistribute them to you. If you would rather
         not contribute in such a public fashion you can email directly to me
         at d.gotterbarn@computer.org.</p>
       <p>Here are a few discussion starters from me:</p>
       <p>1. Standards of Professional competence should probably include the
         gamut of software engineering. The project manager should be held as
         accountable for their work as the test specialist. This may mean that
         we have different standards for those primarily in management and those
         primarily in technical application areas. Several computing codes of
         ethics list separate sets of obligations for different computing roles.</p>
       <p>2. We should tie standards of competence to a common set or sets of
         standards. There are a number of ways to do this. One way is to tie minimal
         general sets of competence to curricula as defined by universities or
         by professional organizations. Another way is encourage vendors to continue
         certifying competence in their software.</p>
       <p>3. On the technical side, competence implies the possession of an adequate
         skill set, but on the ethical side competence implies a disposition to
         act in a certain way, to apply these skills in a certain way. The ethical
         side also seems to include commitments to being honest to others about
         one's abilities and limitations in software development. Some have argued
         that a customer should not have to pay for a professionals education
         if they could get an already trained specialist for less money.</p>
       <p>I offer these points as conversation starters. There is a distinction
         in most professions between standards of ethics, conduct, and practice.
         These standards include a range of statements, Standards of ethics are
         generally broad and aspirational and do not prescribe specific behaviors
         -prevent harm-do not mislead others about your skills.</p>
       <p>Standards of conduct are more specific and standards of practice are
         regulative-do not release a product which has not been adequately tested.
         Violating this later type of standard is generally a foundation for legal
         action. These three types of standards exist for people as members of
         a profession, employees, and as individuals. I mention these standards
         to give you an idea of the range of statements we are looking for. We
         are looking for a range of statements and examples of these types of
         standards as they apply to professional competence. Don't worry which
         category they into which you ideas might fall. I give this distinction
         simply to make clear the breadth we are interested in.</p>
       <p>* HOMEWORK:<br>
   I. Please send email to the list or to me that describes YOUR view of possible
     standards in the area of Professional Competence. We are brainstorming here,
     so don't be shy.</p>
       <p>II. Send email or paper mail to me of examples of ethics standards,
         standards of conduct, and standards of practice that you think are appropriate
         to our working group.<br>
   These could come from professional organizations, from employers, from individuals,
   from scholarly literature, or from the popular press.</p>
       <p>III. Later I will organize these ideas and email edited version for
         the whole group. Then we can begin to refine the ideas presented.</p>
       <p>* SCHEDULE<br>
   APRIL 22: Soft deadline for group submitting materials. At this date I'll start
     editing the submitted stuff. (Soft means I'll continue to include your ideas.</p>
       <p>MAY 6: I send information back to the group, organized (I hope) around
         standards of ethics, standards of conduct, and standards of practice
         and organized according to other suggestions from the group. Open discussion
         and debate about materials I send out.</p>
       <p>MAY 20: Additions and corrections sent back to me.</p>
       <p>JUNE 3: I make another pass at editing the document incorporating additions
         and corrections and send it to the group.</p>
       <p>JUNE 10: Group responds to the latest version.</p>
       <p>JUNE 17: Don sends revised document to the general SEEPP Task Force
         members and to the working group.</p>
       <p>JULY 15 and beyond: Task Force combines working group documents, shapes
         them into a coherent package, and starts selling it to IEEE and ACM.
         The &quot;beyond&quot; includes more work for the working group, but
         we'll get into that later. I know the rythym of this schedule sounds
         daunting, but we are eager to make progress after the painful delays
         we've experienced.</p>
