                     NO SURE BUT HOW ABOUT THIS REWORDING</p>
 
                   <p>4.05. Keep as confidential information gained in their professional 
 
                     work <br>
 
                     that is not in the public domain, where such <br>
 
                     confidentiality is NOT INconsistent with matters of public 
 
                     concern.</p>
 
                   <p>I THINK THERE ARE TWO POINTS HERE ? 1. CONFIDENTIALITY MIGHT 
 
                     BE VERY <br>
 
                     NECESSARY FOR SAFEGUARDING THE PUBLIC AND SO ON AND 2. IF 
 
                     CONFIDENTAILITY <br>
 
                     IS COMMERCIALLY ATTRATCIVE THEN IN DOING SO IT DOES NOT DETRIMENTALLY 
 
                     <br>
 
                     HARM THE PUBLIC AND SO ON. 1. IS THE POSITIVE ISSUE AND 2.

                     &gt; and follow that with any of the numbered (e.g., 8.08) 
 
                     items. The<br>
 
                     &gt; result should be a complete, grammatically?correct sentence.

                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, 
 
                     industry,<br>
 
                     &gt; government, medicine, education, entertainment, social 
 
                     affairs, and<br>
 
                     &gt; ordinary life. Those who contribute, by direct participation 
 
                     or by<br>
 
                     &gt; teaching, to the design and development of software systems 
 
                     have<br>
 
                     &gt; significant opportunities both to do good or to cause 
 
                     harm, and to<br>
 
                     &gt; influence and enable others to do good or cause harm. 
 
                     To ensure, as<br>
 
                     &gt; much as possible, that this power will be used for good, 
 
                     software<br>
 
                     &gt; engineers must commit themselves to making the design 
 
                     and development<br>
 
                     &gt; of software a beneficial and respected profession. In 
 
                     accordance with<br>
 
                     &gt; that commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the 
 
                     following Code<br>
 
                     &gt; of Ethics. <br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; The Code contains eight Principles related to the behavior 
 
                     of and<br>
 
                     &gt; decisions made by professional software engineers, be 
 
                     they practitioners,<br>
 
                     &gt; educators, managers and supervisors, or policy makers, 
 
                     as well as trainees<br>
 
                     &gt; and students of the profession. The Principles identify 
 
                     the various<br>
 
                     &gt; relationships in which individuals, groups, and organizations 
 
                     participate <br>
 
                     &gt; and the primary obligations within these relationships.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; Each Principle of this code addresses three levels of 
 
                     ethical obligation<br>
 
                     &gt; owed by professional software engineers in each of these 
 
                     relationships. <br>
 
                     &gt; The first level identified is a set of ethical values, 
 
                     which professional<br>
 
                     &gt; software engineers share with all other human beings 
 
                     by virtue of their<br>
 
                     &gt; humanity. The second level obliges software engineering 
 
                     professionals to<br>
 
                     &gt; more challenging obligations than those required at level 
 
                     one. Level two<br>
 
                     &gt; obligations are required because professionals owe special 
 
                     care to people<br>
 
                     &gt; affected by their work. The third and deeper level comprises 
 
                     several<br>
 
                     &gt; obligations which derive directly from elements unique 
 
                     to the professional<br>
 
                     &gt; practice of software engineering. The Clauses of each 
 
                     Principle are<br>
 
                     &gt; illustrations of the various levels of obligation included 
 
                     in that<br>
 
                     &gt; relationship.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; The Clauses under each Principle consist of three different 
 
                     types of<br>
 
                     &gt; statement corresponding to each level. Level One: Aspire 
 
                     (to be human);<br>
 
                     &gt; statements of aspiration provide vision and objectives 
 
                     and are intended to<br>
 
                     &gt; direct professional behavior. These directives require 
 
                     significant ethical<br>
 
                     &gt; judgement. Level Two: Expect (to be professional); statements 
 
                     of<br>
 
                     &gt; expectation express the obligations of all professionals 
 
                     and professional<br>
 
                     &gt; attitudes. Again, they do not describe the specific behavior 
 
                     details, but<br>
 
                     &gt; they clearly indicate professional responsibilities in 
 
                     computing. Level<br>
 
                     &gt; Three: Demand (to use good practices); statements of 
 
                     demand assert<br>
 
                     &gt; more specific behavioral responsibilities within software 
 
                     engineering,<br>
 
                     &gt; which are more closely related to the current state of 
 
                     the art. The range<br>
 
                     &gt; of statements is from the more general aspirational statement 
 
                     to specific<br>
 
                     &gt; measurable requirements.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; Although all three levels of professional obligation 
 
                     are recognized, the<br>
 
                     &gt; Code is not intended to be all inclusive, nor is it intended 
 
                     that its<br>
 
                     &gt; individual parts be used in isolation to justify errors 
 
                     of omission or<br>
 
                     &gt; commission. The list of Principles and Clauses is not 
 
                     exhaustive, and<br>
 
                     &gt; should not be read as separating the acceptable from 
 
                     the unacceptable in<br>
 
                     &gt; professional conduct in all practical situations. The 
 
                     Code is not a simple<br>
 
                     &gt; ethical algorithm which generates ethical decisions. 
 
                     In some situations<br>
 
                     &gt; standards may conflict with each other or with standards 
 
                     from other<br>
 
                     &gt; sources. These situations require the software engineer 
 
                     to use ethical<br>
 
                     &gt; judgement to act in a manner which is most consistent 
 
                     with the spirit of<br>
 
                     &gt; the Code of Ethics, given the circumstances. <br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; These ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful 
 
                     consideration<br>
 
                     &gt; of fundamental principles, rather than reliance on detailed 
 
                     regulations. <br>
 
                     &gt; These Principles should influence you to consider broadly 
 
                     who is affected<br>
 
                     &gt; by your work; to examine if you and your colleagues are 
 
                     treating other<br>
 
                     &gt; human beings with due respect; to speculate on how the 
 
                     public would<br>
 
                     &gt; view your decision if they were reasonably well informed; 
 
                     to analyze how<br>
 
                     &gt; the least empowered will be affected by your decision; 
 
                     and to consider if</p>
 
                   <p>CHANGE IF TO WHETHER AND CONSIDERED TO JUDGED</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; your acts would be considered worthy of the ideal professional 
 
                     working<br>
 
                     &gt; as a software engineer. Since this code represents a 
 
                     consensus of those<br>
 
                     &gt; engaged in the profession one should take into account 
 
                     what is likely to<br>
 
                     &gt; be judged as the most ethical way to act in the circumstances 
 
                     by<br>
 
                     &gt; informed, respected, and experienced peers in possession 
 
                     of all the facts<br>
 
                     &gt; and only depart from such a course for profound reasons, 
 
                     backed with<br>
 
                     &gt; careful judgement. <br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering 
 
                     requires a<br>
 
                     &gt; code that is adaptable and relevant to new situations 
 
                     as they occur. <br>
 
                     &gt; However even in this generality, the code provides support 
 
                     for the</p>
 
                   <p>COMMA AFTER HOWEVER</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; software engineer who needs to take positive action 
 
                     by documenting the<br>
 
                     &gt; ethical stance of the profession; it provides an ethical 
 
                     foundation to<br>
 
                     &gt; which individuals within teams and the team as a whole 
 
                     can appeal. The<br>
 
                     &gt; code also helps to define those things which are ethically 
 
                     improper to<br>
 
                     &gt; request of an software engineer.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; The code has an educational function, stating what is 
 
                     required of anyone<br>
 
                     &gt; wishing to join or continue in the software engineering 
 
                     community. <br>
 
                     &gt; Because it expresses the consensus of the profession 
 
                     on ethical issues, it<br>
 
                     &gt; can be used as a guide to decision making and as means

                     &gt; the public and aspiring professionals about the professional

                   <p>&gt; Principle 1: PRODUCT. Software engineers shall, insofar 
 
                     as possible,<br>
 
                     &gt; ensure that the software on which they work is useful 
 
                     and of acceptable<br>
 
                     &gt; quality to the public, the employer, the client, and 
 
                     the user; completed on<br>
 
                     &gt; time and at reasonable cost; and free of error. In particular, 
 
                     software<br>
 
                     &gt; engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>

                     &gt; 1.01. Ensure that specifications for software on which 
 
                     they work have<br>
 
                     &gt; been well documented, satisfy the user's requirements,
