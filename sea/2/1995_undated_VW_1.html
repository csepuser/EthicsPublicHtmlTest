       <p>Call For Participation<br>
   Software Engineering</p>
       <p>Ethical and Professional Standards</p>
       <p>JOINT IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY / ACM PROJECT WORKING GROUPS FORMING</p>
       <p>The IEEE Computer Society and the ACM, the world's two largest organizations
         of computing professionals, with a combined membership of more than one
         hundred and seventy?five thousand members (worldwide) have established
         a Joint Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering
         as a Profession. This steering committee has established three tasks
         forces to accomplish their mission. One task force is identifying the
         body of knowledge and recommended practices, and another task force is
         addressing educational issues. Our task force on Software Engineering
         Ethics and Professional Practices r (SEEPP) is tasked with documenting
         ante codifying standards of ethical and professional practices for Software
         Engineers. We invite your participation in this task. You do NOT need
         to be a member of either society in order to participate.</p>
       <p>1.0 SCOPE These standards shall document generally accepted principles
         for identifying and resolving ethical conflicts relevant to the discipline
         of software engineering. </p>
       <p>Consideration shall be given to the responsibilities and obligations
         of the Software Engineer to peers and laypersons. employer, customer(s),
         the profession and society/humanity. Additionally, consideration shall
         be similarly given to the obligations and responsibilities of these various
         entities towards the Software</p>
       <p>Engineer.</p>
       <p>1.1 GLOBAL APPLICATION The SEEPP task force recognizes that the design,
         development and application of software often transcend national boundaries.
         We feel that it is vitally important that the global computing community
         have the means to insure that this project produces a product which is
         as reflective of the global computing community's wisdom as can be reasonably
         achieved. The participation of individuals from throughout the world
         is important to achieving this goal.</p>
       <p>These standards are intended to document the consensus of the global
         software engineering community. From time to time, consensus on an issue
         may not be clearly recognized. Accordingly, these standards shall also
         document various recommended practices and guidelines when no clear consensus
         can be established.</p>
       <p>2.0 PURPOSE The purpose of the SEEPP task force is to document the international
         consensus for minimally acceptable ethical/professional responsibilities
         and obligations of Software Engineers.</p>
       <p>3.0 ORGANIZATION Working groups are being formed to address specific
         areas of concern. Eight different subject areas are distinguished so
         far. as described below. Should additional subject areas be identified,
         additional working groups may be established. Working groups and illustrative
         issues/topics:</p>
       <p>Institutional Support. &quot;Experts Hotline,&quot; peer review panels,
         conflict resolution, etc. for practicing software engineers. (Chair:
         Michael McFarland mcfarlan@bcuxs2.bc.edu edu)</p>
       <p>Intellectual Property. Ownership of: code, algorithms, systems design
         and specifications, project control methods, test methods, quality improvement
         models, etc., articulate areas that go beyond the law. foster understanding
         by sharing values and ideals, what issues and norms are important for
         SE, how to carry out ethical activity (foundational basis of laws and
         treaties, why obey laws). (Chair: Suzanne Weisband sweisband@bpa.arizona.edu
         Vice Chair: Steven Barber sbarber@panix.com)</p>
       <p>Professional Competence. Truth about skill, obligation to keep current.
         truth about code, what should be produced? (end?use consequences), keep
         staff current, appropriate knowledge base, non</p>
       <p>Computers and Society <br>

   December 1994</p>
       <p>generalization of expertise. educational issues: certification, registration,
         licensure. (Chair: Donald Gotterbarn d.gotterbarn@computer.org)</p>
       <p>Professional Relationships. Communications (professional to professional
         and professional to layperson or society, professional to employer, professional
         to customer, professional to electronic community), support for &quot;whistle
         blowers,&quot; obligations to foster responsible behavior amongst non?professionals.
         (Chair: Joyce Currie Little jclittle@toe.towson.edu)</p>
       <p>Privacy. Monitoring (workplace, every place), confidentiality, data
         aggregation, falsification or communication of a &quot;digital persona&quot; out
         of context, misuse of data, relationship of electronic privacy to other
         policy issues, e,g, computerized medical records and health care reform,
         etc. (Chair: Patrick Sullivan psullivan@brook.edu)</p>
       <p>Reliability &amp; Safety. Contracts, reliability thresholds in contracts,
         testing, risks, user centered design, truth in advertising, informed
         consent for buyers, financial support for improved quality, quantifying
         quality. (Chair: Keith Miller miller@eagle.sangamon.edu</p>
       <p>Security. Data integrity, statutory violations, encryption, malicious
         programming (viruses. etc.). system administrator's responsibility, encryption.
         (Chair: Bob Melford r.melford@computer.org)</p>
       <p>Social Justice. Responsibility to end user, equity of access, allocation
         of resources, computing for the disabled, &quot;de?skilling&quot; (computer
         takes over a person's job). (Chair: Suzanne Weisband sweisband@bpa.arizona.edu</p>
       <p>3.1 PARTICIPATION Participation is open to all individuals who are directly
         and materially affected or interested in these issues. Members of the
         international computing community are particularly encouraged to participate</p>
       <p>3.1.1 WORKING GROUP MEMBERSHIP Individuals may participate in as many
         working groups as they desire.</p>
       <p>3.1.2 ORGANIZATIONAL/INSTITUTIONAL PARTICIPATION If organizations desire
         to send an organizational representative, they shall be accommodated.
         Their inputs will be valued and processed as would any other input. However,
         no organization shall be permitted a veto power over results that reflect
         the consensus of the concerned professionals in the field.</p>
       <p>3.1.3 WORKING GROUP MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION</p>
       <p>PLEASE COMPLETE THE APPLICATION AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT AND E?MAIL
         IT TO: SEEPP?CFP@COMPUTER.ORG</p>
       <p>3.1.4 EXPENSES Participation is voluntary. Each individual is responsible
         for all expenses incurred to support his/her participation. Many institutions
         provide financial support for their volunteers.</p>
       <p>3.2 &quot;OFFICIAL&quot; IEEE STANDARD Working groups will operate according
         to the procedures specified for IEEE Standards (see Governance, below).
         However, working groups will NOT be initially chartered by the IEEE Computer
         Society's Standards Activities Board. (If the working groups were so
         chartered, individuals in several countries would be required to receive
         their government's approval for participation.)</p>
       <p>3.3 GOVERNANCE The conduct of each working group shall follow the same
         written procedures that govern internationally recognized IEEE Standards
         Activities. These procedures specify that prompt consideration should
         be given to the written views and objections of all participants. Objectors
         should be notified of the disposition of an objection and the reasons
         therefor. Unresolved objections and the associated reasons should be
         reported to the entire working group's membership. The conclusions of
         the group should be supported by a consensus of the membership. (This
         would imply a ballot on the final products, probably run as IEEE Draft
         Standards ballots are currently run.</p>

   December 1994</p>
       <p>3.4 E?MAIL &amp; MEETINGS Working group business is expected to be primarily
         conducted via e?mail and computer mediated conferencing. From time to
         time, a working group may also conduct face to face or teleconference
         meetings. These meetings should be conducted in a manner which facilitates
         attendance by as many members as possible.</p>
       <p>4.0 INTERNET ACCESS Each working group member should have a valid Internet
         e?mail account. The member should also be prepared to obtain access to
         other Internet applications such as FTP TELNET, Gopher, WAIS WWW/MOSAIC,
         etc.</p>
       <p>5.0 COMPLETION Working groups shall deliver their product to the SEEPP
         task force before November 1995.</p>
