                   </div>
 
                   <p>In May of 1993, the Board of Governors of the IEEE-CS established 
 
                     a Steering Committee for evaluating, planning, and coordinating 
 
                     actions related to establishing software engineering as a 
 
                     profession. In that same year the ACM Council endorsed the 
 
                     establishment of a Commission on Software Engineering. By 
 
                     January of 1994, both societies formed a joint steering committee 
 
                     &quot;To establish the appropriate set(s) of standards for 
 
                     professional practice of Software Engineering upon which industrial 
 
                     decisions, professional certification, and educational curricula 
 
                     can be based.&quot; To accomplish these tasks they made the 
 
                     following recommendations:</p>
 
                   <p> 1. adopt standard definitions,</p>
 
                   <p> 2. define required body of knowledge and recommended practices 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>3. define ethical standards</p>
 
                   <p> 4. define educational curricula for undergraduate, graduate(MS) 
 
                     and continuing education (for retraining and migration).</p>
 
                   <p>The Steering Committee decided to accomplish these tasks 
 
                     through the establishment of a series of task forces. Initially 
 
                     the task forces established were: Software Engineering body 
 
                     of knowledge and recommended practices; Software Engineering 
 
                     ethics and professional practices, and Software Engineering 
 
                     curriculum. </p>
 
                   <p>The purpose of the Software Engineering ethics and professional 
 
                     practices task force is to document the ethical and professional 
 
                     responsibilities and obligations of software engineers. This 
 
                     draft code of ethics was developed by a task force of the 
 
                     Joint IEEE Computer Society and Association for Computing 
 
                     Machinery Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software 
 
                     Engineering as a Profession. The task force on Software Engineering 
 
                     Ethics and Professional Practices developed this code for 
 
                     a sub?specialization within the constituencies of both of 
 
                     the professional societies. In an attempt to reflect the international 
 
                     character of both organizations and the profession as a whole, 
 
                     the composition of the task force is multinational in both 
 
                     citizenship and in membership in professional computing organizations. 
 
                     The proposed draft Code of Ethics for Software Engineers ( 
 
                     version 3 ) was developed by the task force and reviewed by 
 
                     the Steering Committee for distribution and comment. The purpose 
 
                     of this distribution is to solicit comments from practitioners 
 
                     and other interested parties.</p>
 
                   <p>Codes, if carefully written and properly promoted, can be 
 
                     powerful instruments in the drive for Professionalislm and 
 
                     in establishing safeguards for society. They do not have to 
 
                     be and should not be sterile which is often the perception 
 
                     that people have of them. This draft code evolved after extensive 
 
                     study of several computing and engineering codes[1]. All these 
 
                     codes try to educate and inspire the members of the professional 
 
                     group that adopts the code. Codes also inform the public about 
 
                     the responsibilities that are important to a profession. Codes 
 
                     instruct practitioners about the standards that society expects 
 
                     them to meet, and what their peers strive for and expect of 
 
                     each other. Codes are not meant to encourage litigation, and 
 
                     they are not legislation; but they do offer practical advice 
 
                     about issues that matter to professionals and their clients 
 
                     and they do inform policy makers. These concepts have been 
 
                     adopted in the development of this code. Based on the feedback 
 
                     from readers of this publication and from other sources, a 
 
                     final draft of the code will be developed and presented to 
 
                     the Steering Committee for approval. </p>

                   <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, 
 
                     industry, government, medicine, education, entertainment, 
 
                     social affairs, and ordinary life. Those who contribute, by 
 
                     direct participation or by teaching, to the design and development 
 
                     of software systems have significant opportunities both to 
 
                     do good or to cause harm, and to influence and enable others 
 
                     to do good or cause harm. To ensure, as much as possible, 
 
                     that this power will be used for good, software engineers 
 
                     must commit themselves to making the design and development 
 
                     of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance 
 
                     with that commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the 
 
                     following Code of Ethics. </p>
 
                   <p>The Code contains eight Principles related to the behavior 
 
                     of and decisions made by professional software engineers, 
 
                     be they practitioners, educators, managers and supervisors, 
 
                     or policy makers, as well as trainees and students of the 
 
                     profession. The Principles identify the various relationships 
 
                     in which individuals, groups, and organizations participate 
 
                     and the primary obligations within these relationships.</p>
 
                   <p>Each Principle of this code addresses three levels of ethical 
 
                     obligation owed by professional software engineers in each 
 
                     of these relationships. The first level identified is a set 
 
                     of ethical values, which professional software engineers share 
 
                     with all other human beings by virtue of their humanity. The 
 
                     second level obliges software engineering professionals to 
 
                     more challenging obligations than those required at level 
 
                     one. Level two obligations are required because professionals 
 
                     owe special care to people affected by their work. The third 
 
                     and deeper level comprises several obligations which derive 
 
                     directly from elements unique to the professional practice 
 
                     of software engineering. The Clauses of each Principle are 
 
                     illustrations of the various levels of obligation included 
 
                     in that relationship.</p>
 
                   <p>The Clauses under each Principle consist of three different 
 
                     types of statement corresponding to each level. Level One: 
 
                     Aspire (to be human); statements of aspiration provide vision 
 
                     and objectives and are intended to direct professional behavior. 
 
                     These directives require significant ethical judgement. Level 
 
                     Two: Expect (to be professional); statements of expectation 
 
                     express the obligations of all professionals and professional 
 
                     attitudes. Again, they do not describe the specific behavior 
 
                     details, but they clearly indicate professional responsibilities 
 
                     in computing. Level Three: Demand (to use good practices); 
 
                     statements of demand assert more specific behavioral responsibilities 
 
                     within software engineering, which are more closely related 
 
                     to the current state of the art. The range of statements is 
 
                     from the more general aspirational statement to specific measurable 
 
                     requirements.</p>
 
                   <p>Although all three levels of professional obligation are 
 
                     recognized, the Code is not intended to be all inclusive, 
 
                     nor is it intended that its individual parts be used in isolation 
 
                     to justify errors of omission or commission. The list of Principles 
 
                     and Clauses is not exhaustive, and should not be read as separating 
 
                     the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct 
 
                     in all practical situations. The Code is not a simple ethical 
 
                     algorithm which generates ethical decisions. In some situations 
 
                     standards may conflict with each other or with standards from 
 
                     other sources. These situations require the software engineer 
 
                     to use ethical judgement to act in a manner which is most 
 
                     consistent with the spirit of the Code of Ethics, given the 
 
                     circumstances. </p>
 
                   <p>These ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful 
 
                     consideration of fundamental principles, rather than reliance 
 
                     on detailed regulations. These Principles should influence 
 
                     you to consider broadly who is affected by your work; to examine 
 
                     if you and your colleagues are treating other human beings 
 
                     with due respect; to speculate on how the public would view 
 
                     your decision if they were reasonably well informed; to analyze 
 
                     how the least empowered will be affected by your decision; 
 
                     and to consider whether your acts would be judged worthy of 
 
                     the ideal professional working as a software engineer. Since 
 
                     this code represents a consensus of those engaged in the profession 
 
                     one should take into account what is likely to be judged as 
 
                     the most ethical way to act in the circumstances by informed, 
 
                     respected, and experienced peers in possession of all the 
 
                     facts and only depart from such a course for profound reasons, 
 
                     backed with careful judgement. </p>
 
                   <p>The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering 
 
                     requires a code that is adaptable and relevant to new situations 
 
                     as they occur. However, even in this generality, the code 
 
                     provides support for the software engineer who needs to take 
 
                     positive action by documenting the ethical stance of the profession; 
 
                     it provides an ethical foundation to which individuals within 
 
                     teams and the team as a whole can appeal. The code also helps 
 
                     to define those things which are ethically improper to request 
 
                     of an software engineer. The code has an educational function, 
 
                     stating what is required of anyone wishing to join or continue 
 
                     in the software engineering community. Because it expresses 
 
                     the consensus of the profession on ethical issues, it can 
 
                     be used as a guide to decision making and as means to educate 
 
                     both the public and aspiring professionals about the professional 
 
                     obligation of all software engineers.</p>

                     is not in the public domain, only with their prior knowledge, 
 
                     provided this is consistent with public health, safety, and 
 
                     welfare. </p>
 
                   <p>7.03. Credit fully the work of others.</p>
