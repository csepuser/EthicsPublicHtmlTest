 <p>Dennis,</p>
 <p>I'm sorry that it has taken so long to get back to you. I 
 
                     was here (in my office) only one day last week and I have 
 
                     just completed the 5th of 6 straight weekend (plus some extra 
 
                     days at the beginning and end of the week) meetings, and I 
 
                     have really been scrambling to keep my real job afloat this 
 
                     month.</p>
 
                   <p>The main reason for the conference call is to discuss with 
 
                     you Council's deep concerns about the SWECC and its work and 
 
                     to make sure that we are all on the same page regarding the 
 
                     activities of the SWECC. Council's impression was that the 
 
                     SWECC was formed primarily to help the Texas people develop 
 
                     an exam for the licensing and also to continue the work of 
 
                     the previous joint task force, but the feeling that they got 
 
                     from the proposal and presentation was that it might be an 
 
                     advocate for licensing of software engineers. Council was 
 
                     quite clear that it did not want ACM's name to be linked in 
 
                     any way as supporting licensing. There was also a lot of concern 
 
                     that we must continue to raise objections to such things as 
 
                     the EIT exam and allowing any engineer with enough experience 
 
                     to obtain a software engineering license. (I know that my 
 
                     statements oversimplify the actual process, but the point 
 
                     is the same.)</p>
 
                   <p>The bottom line is that Council wants to be sure that the 
 
                     ACM reps on the SWECC contain at least one &quot;skeptic&quot; 
 
                     who will make sure that ACM's positions are made clear. Don't 
 
                     be misled or put off by my use of the term &quot;skeptic&quot; 
 
                     here. I put it in quotes because the word itself doesn't completely 
 
                     portray the kind of person that is intended. Certainly we 
 
                     don't (or at least many, and I think most, of us don't) want 
 
                     someone obstructing the work of the SWECC, nor do we even 
 
                     want someone who will not make positive contributions.</p>
 
                   <p>So we wanted to discuss with you how best to proceed on this, 
 
                     including getting some reaction from you about these issues. 
 
                     There is no reason that you cannot be considered the &quot;skeptic&quot; 
 
                     if you feel comfortable doing so. But if</p>
 
                   <p> <br>
 
                     you would rather be more of an advocate for the licensing 
 
                     process then we need to discuss how to balance the membership 
 
                     on the SWECC. (In light of the Council discussion we want 
 
                     to review the ACM representatives with you in any case.)</p>
 
                   <p>I hope that trying to summarize the situation by email doesn't 
 
                     give you the wrong impression. Please withhold any negative 
 
                     reactions until we have a chance to talk, to make sure that 
 
                     my terse summary hasn't given the wrong picture. We do have 
 
                     to deal with political realities, and as you know not everyone 
 
                     is realistic regarding the direction of certification and 
 
                     licensing of software engineering because of parochial views 
 
                     of what software engineering should be. I share many of the 
 
                     negative views myself, but I also recognize reality as well 
 
                     as the differences between what is needed for software engineering 
 
                     education and the computer science/engineering curriculum 
 
                     at many schools.</p>
 
                   <p>Again, the bottom line is that we wanted to discuss with 
 
                     you ways that we can satisfy Council's concerns while moving 
 
                     forward on this project. The fact that we are doing this as 
 
                     a group indicates the importance that we place on the project 
 
                     and the intensity of feeling about the issues among many of 
 
                     the Councillors. We want to make sure that we get this &quot;right&quot; 
 
                     to the extent that we can, and that we end up with a productive 
 
                     project that is beneficial to the computing profession(s).</p>
 
                   <p>Please feel free to contact me again by phone or email prior 
 
                     to the conference call if you wish.</p>
