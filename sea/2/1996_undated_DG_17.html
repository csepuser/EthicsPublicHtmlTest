         element of work</p>
       <p align="justify"> Foreword (BCS code of practice model has both a foreword
         and a preamble) &quot;A code is adopted by a community because its members
         accept that adherence to these rules, including the restrictions this
         implies is of benefit to all, inside and outside of the community alike.&quot; (This
         code applies to all members of the ACM and IEEE-CS who have registered
         their commitment to the code with ...((.committed to the code and are
         registered as having done so with ....)). OR &quot;Because they are the
         distillation of considerable experience they set standards for all engaged
         in the computing profession.&quot; </p>
       <p align="justify">(paragraph needs help- need to include teams and organizations)
         the code is intended to set out the professional ethical obligations
         of the community of software engineers (policy makers, managers and supervisors,
         practitioners and academics, and trainees and students) to the profession,
         its members and the communities they serve. It is also intended to help
         guide their professional behavior and ethical decision making. </p>
       <p align="justify">The code is concerned with professional responsibility
         that all computing professionals have to society at large, users, the
         State, clients, the profession and themselves. It is recognized that
         at times these responsibilities set out in the code may clash. The professional
         is expected to take into account the spirit of the entire Code in order
         to resolve ambiguous or contentious issues concerning ethical conduct.</p>
       <p align="justify"> Keith, Here is a first cut at the preamble. We defined
         software engineer very broadly and tried to indicate that the code is
         no exhaustive and not to be treated in a black letter fashion. A failing
         of other codes is that they say the SE must use judgement, but the codes
         don't help prioritize the values. Letters in parentheses indicate someone
         else's code that I nicked a phrase from. My inclination is to modify
         the expression of these thoughts rather than include in our code direct
         quotes from someone else's code.</p>
       <p align="justify">There are a few places where we have framed specific
         questions for you.</p>
       <p align="justify">Look forward to your comments.</p>
       <p align="justify">don</p>
       <p align="justify">PREAMBLE</p>
       <p align="justify">Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce,
         industry, government, medicine, education, entertainment, social affairs,
         and ordinary life. Those who contribute, by direct participation or by
         teaching, to the design and development of software systems have enormous
         opportunities both to do good and to cause harm. To assure, as much as
         possible, that this power will be used for good, software engineers must
         commit themselves to making the design and development of software a
         beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance with that commitment,
         software engineers shall adhere to the following code of ethics. </p>
       <p align="justify">The code contains eight keyword principles related to
         the behavior of and decisions made by professional software engineers,
         be they practitioners, educators, managers and supervisors, or policy
         makers, as well as trainees and students of the profession. The Principles
         identify the various relationships in which individuals, groups, and
         organizations participate and the primary obligations within these relationships.
         . Each principle of this code addresses all three levels of ethical obligation
         owed by professional software engineers in each of these relationships.
         The first level identified is a set of ethical values which they share
         with all other human beings by virtue of their humanity. The second level
         consists of obligations shared by all professionals for a higher order
         of care for those effected by their work. The third and deeper level
         comprises several of those obligations which derive directly from elements
         unique to the professional practice of software engineering. The clauses
         of each principle are illustrations of the various levels of obligation
         included in that relationship.</p>
       <p align="justify">(Keith, we need names for each of the three types of
         statements in the paragraph below. The first is &quot;aspirational&quot; and
         the second and third are called ????????????????????) The clauses under
         each principle consist of three different types of statement. Aspirational
         statements, which provide vision and objectives, are intended to direct
         professional behavior. These directives require significant ethical judgement.
         Statements which express the obligations of all professionals and professional
         attitudes. Again they do not describe the specific behavior details but
         they clearly indicate professional responsibilities in computing. The
         code also contains some more specific behavioral responsibilities within
         software engineering which are more closely related to the current state
         of the art. The range of statement is from the more general aspirational
         statement to specific measurable requirements.</p>
       <p align="justify">Although all levels of professional obligation are recognized
         and because the Code contains different types of statements, the Code
         is not intended to be all inclusive nor is it &quot; intended that its
         individual parts be used in isolation to justify errors of omissions
         or commission (BCS). The list of Principles and Clauses is not exhaustive,
         and should not be read as separating the acceptable from the unacceptable
         in professional conduct in all practical situations. The Code is not
         a simple ethical algorithm which generates ethical decision. In some
         situations standards may conflict with each other or with standards from
         other sources. These situations require ethical judgement to act in a
         manner which is most consistent with the code of ethics, given the circumstances.
         These ethical tensions can best be answered by thoughtful consideration
         of fundamental principles, rather than reliance on detailed regulations.
         (Keith, we should give some indication of how to prioritize here ??-
         First consider Public health safety and welfare(fairness and the well-being
         of others), then consider the impact on your kids college fund, then
         software quality...etc. Simon says, Please tidy this up!!) Since this
         code represents a consensus of those engaged in the profession one should
         determine to act in a manner &quot;likely to be judged by informed, respected,
         and experienced peers in possession of all the facts as the most ethical
         way to act in the circumstances. (ACS)&quot; But even in this generality,
         the code provides support for the software engineer who needs to take
         positive action by documenting the ethical stance of the profession.
         This provides a documented ethical foundation to which individuals within
         teams and the team as a whole can appeal. </p>
       <p align="justify">By indicating the ethical obligations in a particular
         relationship, the code places constraints on what others may ethically
         request of software engineers. The code helps to define those things
         which are ethically improper to request of an software engineer. The
         code has an educational function, by stating what is required of anyone
         wishing to join or continue in the software engineering community. Because
         it expresses the consensus of the profession on ethical issues it can
         be used as a guide to decision making and as means to educate both the
         public and aspiring professionals about the professional obligation of
         software engineers.</p>
