      <p>Dennis:
      </p>
      <p>On the whole I like the ideas set down in your white paper.</p>
       <p>Here are some additional comments/suggestions: I believe the most critical
         element in advancing the state of software engineering professional and
         education issues is to have a established, recoginized, and centralized
         coordination effort. It seems that SWECC can provide this function. The
         SWECC must have wide representation in order to insure recognition and
         acceptance by the community of its coordinating efforts and &quot;decisions&quot;.
         As part of your comments on &quot;The Approach&quot;, &quot;Division
         of Repsonisbility&quot;, and &quot;Cooperative Activity&quot;, I would
         suggest that there should be an overall SWECC plan. It could be rather
         simple (a couple of pages). The plan would include the following:<br>
   * objectives of the SWECC work<br>
   * tasks to be performed<br>
   * task responsibility (inidvidual group, joint ,etc.)<br>
   * a schedule for when tasks will be initally completed, reviewed, and finalized</p>
       <p>* resources available/needed (groups, inidviduals, money, etc.)</p>
       <p>Good luck and let me know how I can help.</p>

       <p>&gt; Dennis Frailey writing to selected members of the<br>
 &gt; SWEBOK project, IAB, SWECC, and various related efforts</p>
       <p>&gt; This is a white paper outlining my thoughts on an issue &gt; that
         is of considerable importance to the software engineering</p>
       <p> &gt; projects being sponsored by SWECCBody of Knowledge &gt; (SWEBOK),
         education, ethics and professional practices, </p>
       <p>&gt; and (to be established) performance norms I also propose </p>
       <p>&gt; some possible solutions I invite comment and &gt; critique from
         all affected parties I intend to propose &gt; implementing something
         along these lines at the SWECC &gt; meeting in Austin on January 28 29, &gt; so
         timely response is of the essence.</p>
       <p>&gt; The issue. <br>
 &gt; It has become dear in recent communcation that there is somewhat &gt; of
 a disconnect over defining certain parts of the body of </p>
       <p>&gt; knowledge for software engineering. Specifically, although the &gt; BOK
         project has clear plans for identifying and documenting those </p>
       <p>&gt; knowledge areas that are unique to software engineering, it is
         not </p>
       <p>&gt; clear how we will identify what knowledge areas within computer</p>
       <p> &gt; science and other disciplines are part of what a software engineer </p>
       <p>&gt; must know. These form the foundation upon which a soltware </p>
       <p>&gt; engineer must be educated, just as a solid 'pre med&quot; program </p>
       <p>&gt; is the foundation on which medical doctors are educated.</p>
       <p> &gt; While those who define the body of knowledge for a medical </p>
       <p>&gt; doctor do not define chemistry, they certainly identify what </p>
       <p>&gt; parts of chemistry a medical doctor must know.</p>
       <p>&gt; Upon reflection, it seems to me that this problem is a direct result<br>
 &gt; of the relative autonomy of the various projects I would like to<br>
 &gt; see that change and, since SWECCs role is to coordinate, I am<br>
 &gt; proposing a way that we could coordinate a closer form of work<br>
 &gt; among the projects</p>
       <p> <br>
 &gt; The goal.</p>
       <p>&gt; It is clear that we must eventually define all that a software
         engineer &gt; should know in order to properly define curricula, establish &gt; accreditation
         criteria, and prepare licensing examinations. It is also &gt; clear that
         all of our projects have both interest and expertise to &gt; contribute
         to this Therefore I would like to offer some ideas that might &gt; lead
         to a strategy for accomplishing what we all hope will be accomplished.</p>
       <p>&gt; The approach:</p>
       <p>&gt; My suggestions involve two elements: an agreement regarding dl
         vision of &gt; responsibility and an agreement for cooperative activity
         among the various &gt; projects Speaking from the SWECC perspective,
         I propose &gt; that SWECC coordinate and facilitate these cooperative
         activities &gt; once the projects agree on what they would be.</p>
       <p>&gt; As an example of a cooperative activity, the education project
         has &gt; recently discussed a possible workshop </p>
       <p>&gt; that would deal with certain issues about what must be in the &gt; core
         curriculum of a software engineer. I believe this is an excellent &gt; example
         of an activity that could be cooperative among the projects, because
         it would address key issues that affect all of them.</p>
       <p>&gt; Division of Responsibility</p>
       <p>&gt; I propose that the BOK project accept full responsibility for the
         following:<br>
 &gt; identifying the know/edge areas that are unique to software engineers and
 identifying, within each know/edge area, identifying and providing reference
 material to definitive sources on the topics that are essential to a software
 engineer. They ha ve a/ready produced a baseline set of such know/edge areas
 and I believe this part of their activity is well underway identifying other
 disciplines that contain know/edge areas that are important for a software engineer.
 This too has a/ready been done in a baseline manner.</p>
       <p>&gt; I propose that the BOK project and the Education project accept
         joint<br>
 &gt; responsibility (and include tasks in both of their plans) for.<br>
 &gt; identifying those know/edge areas within other disciplines (computer science,
 computer engineering, math, science, etc) that are necessary for a sofware engineers
 Examples might include data structures from computer science or computer architecture
 from computer engineering or discrete mathematics<br>
   propose that the Education project accept full responsibility for identifying
   and providing authoritative references for the topics within each knowledge
   area from &quot;other&quot; disciplines that are necessary for software engineers
   I believe this has already been started, and as a SWECC member I would endorse
   further work in this area<br>
   4of5<br>
   I propose that the (not yet formed) performance norms project work jointly
   with the Code of Ethics and Professional Practices project to identify the
   tasks that a software engineer would be<br>
 &gt; expected to perform. Perhaps the other two projects should also<br>
   be involved in this This would be based on the know/edge areas defined by the
   other two projects and would probably not commence for about a year. At that
   time, the two projects should further define how this can be subdivided, but
   it seems to me that the Code of Ethics and Professional Practices project would
   concentrate on defining the professional practices that would be considered
   essential for a software engineer and the<br>
 &gt; performance norms project would focus on the skills and the performance
 standards associated with these.</p>
       <p><br>
   Cooperative activity:<br>
   Each project would have an (at /east) annual review of its progress, to which
   each other project and SWECCshould be invited to send representatives This
   review might occur during a SWECC meeting or might occur separately, depending
   on the magnitude of the project and the amount of work to be reported on. SWECC
   can attempt to schedule its meetings to adjoin major project reviews so as
   to minimize travel for all concerned. Since SWECC must report to its sponsoring
   societies (ACM and IEEE CS) on an annual basis, we can also coordinate the
   timing to fit their annual schedules.<br>
   For all responsibilities that are joint, the affected projects should plan
   and budget for appropriate joint activities and should keep SWECC and the other
   projects informed of these.<br>
   I invite comments and suggestions.<br>
