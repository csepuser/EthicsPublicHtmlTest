                     positively comment on the things we agree need some rewording 
 
                     but also point out that a code has to be aspirational if we 
 
                     are to achieve a minimum accepatable standard from all professionals 
 
                     and that this will also differentiate professionals from opportunists.</p>

                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; Felipe and Dennis (and Don),<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; You have asked ACM SIGSOFT for its comments on the draft 
 
                     Code of<br>
 
                     &gt; Ethics. I have asked my Executive Committee for comments, 
 
                     and I<br>
 
                     &gt; hope some will be forthcoming.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; In any case, I have some of my own comments, which I 
 
                     include below.<br>
 
                     &gt; And, because some of my concerns are (to me at least) 
 
                     quite serious,<br>
 
                     &gt; let me take this opportunity to state clearly that until 
 
                     some of these<br>
 
                     &gt; problems are clarified and/or fixed, that ACM SIGSOFT 
 
                     does *not*<br>
 
                     &gt; endorse this draft code.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; In general, I think that my comments fall into two categories:<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; *General comments about ethics (such as financial conflict),<br>
 
                     &gt; where I may be especially naive.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; *Comments about places where I think the code is too 
 
                     naive<br>
 
                     &gt; about some special properties of software and the software<br>
 
                     &gt; industry.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; I'm less worried about the first category than the second 
 
                     because it<br>
 
                     &gt; would, if I am correct, significantly reduce the collection 
 
                     of people<br>
 
                     &gt; that might pay attention to and learn from the proposed 
 
                     code.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; Feel free to pass these comments around as you wish (preferably<br>
 
                     &gt; including this message as context). I suspect that they 
 
                     sound far<br>
 
                     &gt; more negative than they should, but perhaps they will 
 
                     generate some<br>
 
                     &gt; useful improvements.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; David<br>
 
                     &gt; *****<br>
 
                     &gt; I've just read the draft of the software engineering 
 
                     code of ethics.<br>
 
                     &gt; And, indeed, I have a couple of comments. <br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; 1) There is not a single mention of the issue of modifying 
 
                     or<br>
 
                     &gt; changing<br>
 
                     &gt; existing software. Since this is a significant piece 
 
                     of the industry,<br>
 
                     &gt; the omission is obvious and serious. I don't believe 
 
                     that adding in a<br>
 
                     &gt; few words can handle this easily, either, because in 
 
                     many cases the<br>
 
                     &gt; pressures to make changes without a &quot;full&quot; 
 
                     understanding of the<br>
 
                     &gt; software are real and are reasonable.<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     [Miller, Keith] It is &quot;reasonable&quot; to make changes 
 
                     in code<br>
 
                     without a full understanding of the software??? That doesn't 
 
                     sound<br>
 
                     reasonable or ethical to me. He's right... we have a serious<br>
 
                     disagreement here.</p>
 
                   <p>[sr] Perhaps the issue is to undertake appropriate impact 
 
                     analysis prior <br>
 
                     to software modification taking into account the role/functioality 
 
                     of the <br>
 
                     software ? the greater thescopr wrt people, organisations, 
 
                     society the <br>
 
                     more care required. My ethical hotspot concept!!</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; Another take on this is that the ability to change and 
 
                     evolve software<br>
 
                     &gt; is one of the primary characteristics that distinguishes 
 
                     software from<br>
 
                     &gt; other engineering disciplines. If we don't account for 
 
                     the<br>
 
                     &gt; distinguishing characteristics of software, then we can 
 
                     use &quot;any old<br>
 
                     &gt; engineering ethics code.&quot;<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; [ dg? I AGREE THAT MODIFYABILITY IS ONE OF THE DISTINGUISHING<br>
 
                     &gt; CHARATERISTICS BUT WHEN WE TEACH MAINTENANCE WE SAY THAT 
 
                     THE NORMAL<br>
 
                     &gt; DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IS APPLIED TO AN EXISTING SOFTWARE 
 
                     ARTIFACT?<br>
 
                     &gt; UNDERSTAND THE NEEDED CHANGE, DESIGN THE CHANGE, IMPELEMENT 
 
                     AND TEST<br>
 
                     &gt; THE<br>
 
                     &gt; CHANGE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE CHANGE HAD NO UNEXPECTED 
 
                     SIDE EFFECTS.]<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; 2) My reading is that the code implicitly focuses on 
 
                     contract<br>
 
                     &gt; software,<br>
 
                     &gt; where specifications and design documents play a critical 
 
                     and direct<br>
 
                     &gt; role. <br>
 
                     &gt; However, a significant amount of the industry now works 
 
                     in the<br>
 
                     &gt; shrinkwrap<br>
 
                     &gt; world, where these issues are wildly different. Yes, 
 
                     specification<br>
 
                     &gt; exists. Yes, design exists. But phrases like &quot;satisfy 
 
                     the user's<br>

                     [Miller, Keith] This is a serious problem. The client, in 
 
                     this<br>
 
                     case, can be marketing of the company producing the software. 
 
                     Or the<br>
 
                     developer him/herself becomes the client. I think we should

                     &quot;client&quot; for shinkwrapped software: the person or

                     in. I think <br>
 
                     its a new twist on &quot;end user&quot; issues ? We need to 
 
                     address this point. <br>

                     &gt; reduction of risk.&quot; Seems reasonable, for sure. 
 
                     But what about a<br>
 
                     &gt; situation where a company (quite reasonably) chooses 
 
                     a niche in which<br>
 
                     &gt; their immediate goal is to produce a software product 
 
                     that is likely<br>
 
                     &gt; to be<br>
 
                     &gt; low quality but first on the market? Or what about a 
 
                     company that<br>
 
                     &gt; intentionally takes a high?risk strategy (perhaps, for 
 
                     example,<br>

                     &gt; on other products that aren't yet completed)? Perhaps 
 
                     situations like<br>
 
                     &gt; these are covered indirectly in the draft code, but I 
 
                     don't believe<br>

                     [Miller, Keith] Risks are unavoidable and acceptable, but 
 
                     ONLY<br>
 
                     when the affected parties are able to choose that risk. Disclaimers 
 
                     on<br>
 
                     such software would be required. Contractual bargains must

                   <p>[sr] I agree with Keith</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; 4) 1.14 talks about making tradeoffs visible to all 
 
                     parties concerned,<br>
 
                     &gt; including the public. And 6.13 talks about sharing &quot;useful<br>
 
                     &gt; software?related knowledge, inventions, or discoveries 
 
                     with the<br>
 
                     &gt; profession&quot;. If the draft code doesn't make it clear 
 
                     that companies<br>
 
                     &gt; and software engineers have interests???in particular, 
 
                     certain classes<br>
 
                     &gt; of intellectual property???that needn't be disclosed, 
 
                     or that must be<br>
 
                     &gt; disclosed with care, then it will not be of use to many 
 
                     software<br>
 
                     &gt; engineering practitioners. You address this somewhat 
 
                     in Principle 4,<br>
 
                     &gt; especially 4.05, but explicitly observing this inherent 
 
                     set of<br>
 
                     &gt; conflicts seems of value.<br>

                     &gt; <br>
 
                     [Miller, Keith] This seems doable with a few extra words.

                   <p>&gt; 6) 3.07 discusses avoiding financial conflicts of interest. 
 
                     Well, I'm<br>
 
                     &gt; no expert here, but let me give you two examples where 
 
                     such conflict<br>
 
                     &gt; would exist according to 3.07, but where it seems ludicrous. 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; a) I was once on a program committee for a software<br>
 
                     &gt; engineering conference. I was advocating the acceptance 
 
                     of<br>
 
                     &gt; a videotape by a person at a company for a presentation. 
 
                     <br>
 
                     &gt; I was asked by another committee member if I had stock 
 
                     in<br>
 
                     &gt; the company. Well, it turns out I did (I'd guess it was 
 
                     worth<br>
 
                     &gt; under $1500 at the time), although it hadn't occurred 
 
                     to me.<br>
 
                     &gt; Was I unethical? Nope. Was there an appearance of being<br>
 
                     &gt; unethical? Well, perhaps. Would the conference (and the<br>
 
                     &gt; profession) have been better had I recused myself? Surely<br>
 
                     &gt; not. Indeed, given that almost everyone in the community 
 
                     owns<br>
 
                     &gt; mutual funds that own high?tech stocks, I'll wager that 
 
                     this<br>
 
                     &gt; kind of broad &quot;financial interest&quot; conflict 
 
                     would make it all<br>
 
                     &gt; but impossible to make progress in many bodies. <br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; (Professional standards committees would, I suspect, 
 
                     fall<br>
 
                     &gt; apart entirely. Why? Because all industrial members would,<br>
 
                     &gt; according to 3.07, have an ethical conflict if their 
 
                     employers<br>
 
                     &gt; would benefit from their involvement???and this is, of 
 
                     course,<br>
 
                     &gt; in some sense the primary goal of sending employees to 
 
                     serve<br>
 
                     &gt; on standardization boards.)<br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; b) The State of Washington has a new and extremely firm 
 
                     ethics<br>
 
                     &gt; code. Hunter Simpson was a member of the state's Information<br>
 
                     &gt; System's Board (ISB), a gubenatorial appointee. He's 
 
                     been CEO<br>
 
                     &gt; of a company or two and is quite wealthy. He owned $9K 
 
                     of IBM<br>
 
                     &gt; stock. He was involved in a (unanimous) decision to award 
 
                     a <br>
 
                     &gt; state contract to IBM. He was ultimately punished by 
 
                     the <br>
 
                     &gt; State Ethics Board for having a conflict of interest. 
 
                     This<br>
 
                     &gt; was (although you might not be able to tell from my brief<br>
 
                     &gt; description) crazy as can be. If applied even more<br>
 
                     &gt; aggressively (easy to believe in our state's case) you 
 
                     could <br>
 
                     &gt; imagine situations in which the only people who could 
 
                     sit on<br>
 
                     &gt; the state's ISB are people who have no assets and have 
 
                     no <br>
 
                     &gt; knowledge of technology. <br>
 
                     &gt; <br>
 
                     &gt; OK, I'm sure that these are not what you had in mind. 
 
                     And I suspect<br>
 
                     &gt; (again) that these kind of &quot;exceptions&quot; are 
 
                     covered elsewhere in the<br>
 
                     &gt; draft. (And I'm sure you have way better examples than 
 
                     mine, since I<br>
 
                     &gt; am confident you've thought about this.) But 3.07 is 
 
                     simply too<br>

                     [Miller, Keith] I think we have a real problem here. He shrugs<br>
 
                     off cases that, IMHO, are pretty clearly cases where there 
 
                     IS a<br>
 
                     appearance of conflict of interest. In the case of mutual 
 
                     funds, I can<br>
 
                     understand the problem he has. But if a state official has

                     than the official had better put that stuff in a blind trust...

                     [sr] I am reminded of my time in Poland when my Polish colleagues 
 
                     could not afford latest proprietory software because of global 
 
                     pricing policies form MS and the like designed to maximise 
 
                     profit and minimise administrative effort regardless of social/economic 
 
                     impact in developing <br>
 
                     countries. This is a difficult clause but I don't think its 
 
                     just about bribes it is about social justice. A code should 
 
                     set teh moral high ground for us to aspire to. Somehow we 
 
                     have to write a clause that does this but takes the RB supporters 
 
                     with us. December's &quot;toughie&quot; task!!!</p>
