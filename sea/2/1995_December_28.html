                   <p> My apologies for the lateness of this information. I made
                     the notes some months ago but have had an incredibly busy
                     last few months. Fortunately, I have a short respite over
                     the Christmas break and will now take this opportunity to
                     get this across to all of you.</p>
                   <p> Firstly, may I wish everybody in the group the compliments
                     of the season.</p>
                   <p> The following consists of excerpts from the American Institute
                     of Certified Public Accountants Professional Standards Manual
                     which, I feel, may be relevant to our task. Occasionally
                     there is some interpretation on my part. Much of it is in
                     a summary or precis form:</p>
                   <p> -----------------------------------------------------------</p>
                   <p>U. S. AUDITING:</p>
                   <p> General Standards:</p>
                   <p> 1. The audit is to be maintained by a person or persons
                     having adequate technical training and proficiency as an
                     auditor.</p>
                   <p> 2. In all matters relating to the assignment, an independence
                     in mental attitude is to be maintained by the auditor or
                     auditors.</p>
                   <p> 3. Due professional care is to be exercised in the performance
                     of the audit and the preparation of the report.</p>
                   <p> Standards of Field Work</p>
                   <p> 1. The work is to be adequately planned, and assistants,
                     if any, are to be properly supervised. (My observation with
                     relevance to our profession: Consider when putting novices
                     on a project team).</p>
                   <p> Standards of Reporting</p>
                   <p> Present fairly in accordance with generally accepted Accounting
                     principles. Adequacy of disclosure.</p>
                   <p> In general standards: consider nature of standards, training
                     and proficiency, independence, performance of work done (due
                     care).</p>
                   <p> In standards of field work: consider planning and supervision,
                     substantive tests (very important!), errors and irregularities,
                     using work of specialist, illegal acts of client. Acknowledge
                     sources.</p>
                   <p> Factors to be considered before applying substantive tests.
                     Communication between predecessor and successor auditors
                     (in our case, programmers, analysts, etc.)</p>
                   <p> Responsibility to detect and report errors and irregularities
                     (both in the product and in the behavior of the producer).</p>
                   <p> Professional skepticism. Evaluation of test results. Evaluating
                     the work of others.</p>
                   <p> Using the Work of Specialists:</p>
                   <p> Decision whether to use that work.<br>
   Using the findings.<br>
   Acknowledging the specialist.</p>
                   <p> Litigation, claims and assessments:</p>
                   <p> Knowledge of Federal, State and local laws and regulations
                     - compliance with these. The auditor's consideration of an
                     Entity's ability to continue as a going concern (in Computing,
                     consultant should consider the feasibility of what the customer
                     wants to do and what consequences this may have).</p>
                   <p><br>
   CODE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT</p>
                   <p><br>
   Principles of Professional Conduct - (Articles)</p>
                   <p> 1. Responsibility</p>
                   <p> In carrying out their responsibilites as professionals,
                     members should exercise sensitive professional and moral
                     judgements in all their activities</p>
                   <p> 2. The Public Interest</p>
                   <p> Members should accept the obligation to act in a way that
                     will serve the public interest, honor the public trust and
                     demonstrate commitment to professionalism.</p>
                   <p> 3. Integrity</p>
                   <p> To maintain and broaden public confidence, members should
                     perform all professional responsibilities with the highest
                     sense of integrity. (This, I consider, to be of paramount
                     importance).</p>
                   <p> 4. Objectivity and Independence</p>
                   <p> A member should maintain objectivity and be free of conflicts
                     of interest in discharging professional responsibilities.
                     A member in public practice should be independent in fact
                     and appearance when providing auditing and other attestation
                     services.</p>
                   <p> 5. Due Care</p>
                   <p> A member should observe the professional, technical and
                     ethical standards, strive continually to improve competence
                     and the quality of services, and discharge professional responsibility
                     to the best of the member's ability.</p>
                   <p> 6. Scope and Nature of Services</p>
                   <p> A member in public practice should observe the Principles
                     of the Code of Professional Conduct in determining the scope
                     and nature of services to be provided.</p>
                   <p> Rules - Applicability:</p>
                   <p> The bylaws of the AICPA require that members adhere to
                     the rules of the Code of Professional Conduct and that members
                     must be prepared to justify departure from those rules.</p>
                   <p> Independence, Integrity and Objectivity:</p>
                   <p> Ethics rulings: acceptance of a gift. Conflicts of interest.
                     Family relationships. Special favors.</p>
                   <p> Other Responsibilities:</p>
                   <p> Advertising and other forms of solicitation. Disclosure
                     of client information (client confidentiality). </p>
                   <p>Commissions - Fees in payment for services.<br>
   Member interviewed by the Press.<br>
   Responsibilities of partners.</p>

   Retention of membership - Requirements.<br>
   Certification of membership.<br>
   Rescindment of membership - Procedures for this.<br>

                   <p><br>
   The following are extracts (and some rephrasing) from some relevant (in my
     opinion!) sections of the Professional Standards Manual:</p>
                   <p><br>
   Section 510<br>
   -----------</p>
                   <p> 7091.01 ... ultimately lies in the results that are produced.
                     These results must be judged from the standpoint of society
                     as a whole, and not merely from that of any one group of
                     interested persons.</p>
                   <p> 7091.02 ... must be adapted to meet changes as they occur.</p>
                   <p> 7092.03 ... uniformity is a worthwhile goal. ... but should
                     not be pursued to the exclusion of other benefits.</p>
                   <p> 7092.04 ... changes of objectives and conditions will lead
                     to the adoption of new procedures. Consequently, diversity
                     of practice may continue as new procedures are adopted before
                     the old ones become obsolete.</p>
                   <p> 7092.05 Principal objectve ... narrow areas of difference
                     and inconsistency. ... Further development and recognition
                     of generally accepted principles.</p>
                   <p><br>
   Section 520 - Rules of Conduct<br>
   -----------</p>
                   <p> 7010.01 Rule 203. Deals with departure from established
                     accounting principles, e. g., making statements that a financial
                     statement is presented in conformity with generally accepted
                     principles when that does not appear to be the case. The<br>
   person making such a statement must demonstrate that departure from the norm
   can be justified in this instance.</p>
                   <p> 7010.02 Rule 203 was adopted to require compliance with
                     accounting principles promulgated by the body designated
                     to establish such principles.</p>
                   <p> 7010.03 It recognizes that it may be difficult to anticipate
                     all the circumstances to which such principles might be applicable.
                     It recognizes that there may be occasions where literal application
                     of pronouncements may be misleading. (My observation: Such
                     a situation could lead to a revision of the principles involved).</p>
                   <p> 7010.04 How we define &quot;usual circumstances&quot; should
                     be a matter of professional judgement.</p>

                     ...</p>
                   <p> 7263.07 Pervasive principles specify the general approach
                     accountants take to recognition and measurement of events
                     that affect the financial position and results of operations
                     of enterprises.</p>
                   <p> (As you can imagine, by the numbers, there are a lot of
                     sections).</p>
                   <p>The following are taken from &quot;Morality in Accounting&quot; by
                     Riahi Belkaoui:</p>
                   <p>From the preface - opening sentence: ... deemed vital to
                     users' decision making.</p>
                   <p> Page 1. ... the idea of neutrality in preparation ... and
                     the idea of justice in outcome.</p>
                   <p> D. R. Scott (1941): &quot;Accounting rules, procedures
                     and techniques should be fair, unbiased and impartial. They
                     should not serve a special interest.&quot;</p>
                   <p> Page 2. Fairness connotes compliance with generally accepted
                     ... principles and ... standards.</p>
                   <p> Page 26. Utilitarain Ethics: An action is considered to
                     be morally right or wrong solely on the consequences that
                     result from that action.</p>
                   <p> Page 27. Deontological Ethics: An action is considered
                     morally right if it conforms with a proper moral rule. An
                     action that violates the rule, but results in beneficial
                     consequences is still considered wrong.</p>
                   <p> Page 28. Schrag: The language of morality is the language
                     of responsiveness and responsivility and if there is to be
                     talk of and 'ethics' in all this, it will need to be an ethics
                     of the fitting response.</p>
                   <p> Page 35. Those who are inclined to ascribe a much higher
                     level of altruism to the motives of professionals have long
                     insisted that the essence of professionalism is to put the
                     public's interest ahead of self interest. A dedication to
                     serving<br>
   others is regarded as essential in laying claim to being a professional, and
   a professional has an obligation to be concerned about sub-standard behavior,
   whether or not it is actionable under the law.</p>
