                   The draft evolved after extensive study of several computing 
 
                   and engineering codes[1]. All these codes try to educate and 
 
                   inspire the members of the professional group that adopts the 
 
                   code. Codes also informs the public about the responsibilities 
 
                   that are important to a profession. Codes instruct practitioners 
 
                   about the standards that society expects them to meet, and what 
 
                   their peers strive for and expect of each other. Codes are not 
 
                   meant to encourage litigation, and they are not legislation; 
 
                   but they do offer practical advice about issues that matter 
 
                   to professionals and their clients and they do inform policy 
 
                   makers. Based on the feedback from readers of this publication 
 
                   and from other sources, a final draft of the code will be developed 
 
                   and presented to the Steering Committee for approval. <BR wp="BR1">

                   <P>Leonard,</P>
 
                   <P> Here is the best I can come up with as a history of our 
 
                     task force. There was significant time wasted waiting for 
 
                     approval of the process. The real work got done by a very 
 
                     small subset of the original responses to the CFP. The real 
 
                     work on the Code was done from July 1996- December 1997. From 
 
                     December 1997 until now most of the work has been done by 
 
                     the executive committee of the task force; tweaking the Code, 
 
                     responding to formal and informal reviews and nursing the 
 
                     Code through the approval process. I imagine many of the volunteers 
 
                     had no idea of the amount of work that would be involved. 
 
                     The timing of my sabbatical was very fortunate. The Code and 
 
                     supporting documents was the major product of my sabbatical 
 
                     at the Centre Computing and Social Responsibility. The work 
 
                     of Miller and Rogerson was essential to the completion of 
 
                     this project.</P>

                   <P>12 The Executive Committee incorporated relevant responses

                     4 which they recommended to the Steering Committee, having

                     and Rogerson released to the web </P>
 
                   <P>3/-4/ The Code was distributed to several corporate reviewers 
 
                     and academicians world wide. This resulted in version 2. Version 
 
                     2 received no comment from the steering committee. They required 
 
                     that we modify the article to make clear that the Code was 
 
                     not a legal document and was submitted for publication in 
 
                     the July issue of SIGSOFT. </P>
 
                   <P>2/14 Gotterbarn authors the reports and distributes them 
 
                     to SEEPP for review, and then delivers them to the Steering 
 
                     Committee, including version 1.0 of the Code. Included was 
 
                     a project plan for the next few months of the project. There 
 
                     was no official response from the Steering Committee to this 
 
                     work.</P>
 
                   <P>1 Gotterbarn Reorganized into a single committee consisting 
 
                     of the leaders of 7 of the 8 working groups and members of 
 
                     Gotterbarn's working group who had been active in developing 
 
                     the rough draft. Gotterbarn further structured SEEPP with 
 
                     an executive committee-those who would work with intensity 
 
                     on getting the Code finished and the rest of the task force 
 
                     who would contribute their own imperatives, review, monitor, 
 
                     and vote on all modifications to the Code. Gotterbarn was 
 
                     on Sabbatical leave in England at the Centre for Computing 
 
                     and Social Responsibility (CCSR) from January to July. The 
 
                     Director of CCSR, Simon Rogerson, had extensive experience 
 
                     in software development and was asked to be one of the member 
 
                     of the Executive Committee. Keith Miller, a software engineering 
 
                     professor and practicing software engineer was the other member 
 
                     of the executive committee. These three individuals did the 
 
                     major work on the Code with the constant and significant support 
 
                     of the remaining members of the task force.</P>
 
                   <P>1996</P>
 
                   <P>12/ Gotterbarn given sole authority to direct the SEEPP task 
 
                     force. He was requested to produce several reports by 2/14 
 
                     and finish the Code before December 1998. 1. A revised Code 
 
                     which is grounded in other engineering principles, 2. A presentation 
 
                     of how this revised Code is grounded in other Codes, and 3. 
 
                     and an explanation and justification of those elements that 
 
                     are new to the draft Code, those elements which are not from 
 
                     other Codes.</P>
 
                   <P>11/ The steering committee, after a meeting in Pittsburgh, 
 
                     responded with some comments on this draft- version 0. </P>
