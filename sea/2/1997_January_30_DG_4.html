       <p> CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS v1.0 September 1996</p>
       <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
       <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, industry, 
         government, medicine, entertainment, and ordinary life. Because the utility 
         of computers depends in large part on the instructions written for them, 
         those who design, develop, and test software have enormous opportunities 
         both to do good and to cause harm.</p>
       <p> To assure, as much as possible, that this power will be used for good, 
         software engineers commit themselves to making the design, development, 
         and testing of software a distinct, beneficial, and respected profession. 
         In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall adhere to 
         the following standards of conduct. </p>
       <p>The seven main paragraphs state general rules. Each subsidiary clause 
         is a specific application of its general rule, one experience has shown 
         needs express statement; but no set of subsidiary clauses exhausts the 
         general rule.</p>
       <p>Rule 1: PRODUCT. </p>
       <p>Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, assure that the software 
         on which they work is useful to public, employer, customer, and user, 
         completed on time and at reasonable cost, and free of significant error. 
         In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
       <p> 1.01. Assure that specifications for software on which they work have 
         been put in writing, satisfy the user's requirements, and have the customer's 
         approval. PMI IIb - ACM 3.4</p>
       <p> 1.02. Assure that they understand fully the specifications for software 
         on which they work. PMI IIb - ACM 3.4 </p>
       <p>1.03. Assure that they are qualified, by education and experience, for 
         any project on which they work. PE II2a - IEEE 6 - PMI Ib - ICCP 2.5 </p>

         proper procedures for control of quality and risk. PMI IIb - ACM 2.1 </p>
       <p>1.07. Assure proper estimates of cost, schedule, personnel, and outcome 
         on any project on which they work. PMI IIb </p>
       <p>1.08. Assure adequate documentation on any project on which they work, 
         including a log of problems discovered and solutions adopted. PMI IIb 
         - ACM 3.4</p>
       <p> 1.09. Assure proper testing, debugging, and review of software and related 
         documents on which they work. PMI IIb - ACM 3.4 </p>
       <p>1.10. Assure that software and related documents on which they work respect 
         the privacy of those who will be subject to the software. PMI IIb - ACM 
         1.7 </p>
       <p>1.11 Assure that raw information used in software is accurate, derives 
         from a legitimate source, and is used only in ways properly authorized. 
         ACM 1.7,1.8 - ICCP 2.8 </p>
       <p>1.12. Assure ethical, economic, cultural, legal, and environmental issues
