      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" -->Dear 
 
                   Task Force Members, 
 
                   <p>1. Thank you! <br>
 
                     I'd like to thank those who commented on my draft on Functions 
 
                     of Codes of Ethics and who contributed to annotating the code. 
 
                     I would especially like to thank Ed for his effort.</p>
 
                   <p>2. Baseline Document<br>
 
                     As you may recall, the plan was, while you are commenting 
 
                     on the Functions of Code paper, I would be collating your 
 
                     contributions to annotating the codes and writing a description 
 
                     of its architecture and then I would distribute a draft of 
 
                     this document to you for you comments. The working copy of 
 
                     that document is attached. In the interest of good configuration 
 
                     management please use this as the base from which we work 
 
                     and send your comments to the list or to me. The twelve codes 
 
                     we have used in the comparison are sufficient to demonstrate 
 
                     the roots of the proposed codes in other relevant professional 
 
                     codes. We have integrated Ed's results into the baseline document. 
 
                     The comparison is set up as a table for ease of comparison 
 
                     between codes and code elements. The table is attached as 
 
                     a Microsoft Word Document. </p>
 
                   <p>3. Complete Consensus Functions paper<br>
 
                     While you are reviewing the this code comparison and making 
 
                     comments, I will be revising the Functions paper in the light 
 
                     of your comments. This will get us well on the way to completing 
 
                     the tasks set for us by the Steering Committee.</p>
 
                   <p>4. Additional Help and Suggested Code Modifications<br>
 
                     I am fortunate to be at the Centre for Computing and Social 
 
                     Responsibility this semester, which is supplying both intellectual 
 
                     and clerical support for this effort. We have received many 
 
                     comments on the draft code. We are integrating the comments 
 
                     with the code and making some of the tentative changes to 
 
                     the code based on these comments. That document should be 
 
                     ready for distribution to you for comment shortly. </p>
 
                   <p>5. Tentative Plan <br>
 
                     The process of completing a code of ethics and getting it 
 
                     accepted by professional societies is a complex process. In 
 
                     broadest terms, the next steps are: 1 to submit a revised 
 
                     code to the steering committee for review and comment, 2. 
 
                     Revise the code in the light of their comments, 3. Circulate 
 
                     the code more widely for comment and revise accordingly. 4. 
 
                     Print the Code in the ACM and IEEE publications with a survey 
 
                     asking for comments and voting on each item. This will include 
 
                     a request for revision of an code element when there is disagreement. 
 
                     5. Revisit the code in the light of these comments and votes. 
 
                     6. This step will be determined by the results of 5.</p>
 
                   <p>6, Thanks again for you help.</p>
 
                   <p>Regards,</p>

                   <p align="center"><strong>The Architecture of the Draft Software 
 
                     Engineering Code of Ethics and Its Relations to other Codes 
 
                     of Ethics Gotterbarn &amp; Rogerson Centre for Computing and 
 
                     Social Responsibility</strong></p>
 
                   <p>This document was developed in response to a request for 
 
                     the IEEE-CS/ACM Joint Steering Committee for The Professionalization 
 
                     of Software Engineering. The architecture of the draft Software 
 
                     Engineering Code of Ethics (SECEv1) has been modified in the 
 
                     light of comments from the software engineering and computer 
 
                     ethics communities. It should be noted that we use the term 
 
                     software engineer to include the entire software engineering 
 
                     community; those software engineers practicing in the private 
 
                     and public sector and those in software engineering education. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>The structure of SECEv1 was modeled on the format of the 
 
                     National Society of Professional Engineers Code of Ethics(NSPE) 
 
                     in so far as it addresses the various ethical responsibilities 
 
                     of the professional in terms of the particular relationships 
 
                     in which the professional stands. Thus the first version was 
 
                     organized around the software engineer's obligations in product 
 
                     development, obligations to the public, obligations to use 
 
                     professional judgement, obligations to the client and the 
 
                     employer, obligations to the profession of software engineering, 
 
                     obligations to colleagues, and obligation to self as a practicing 
 
                     professional. Each of these relationships carry different 
 
                     ethical obligations and the practicing professional must be 
 
                     cognizant of all of these obligations. Following this code 
 
                     Following the NSPE code closely led to many of the statements 
 
                     in the SECEv1 closely resembling statements in NSPE (See attached 
 
                     table below for details of this relationship).</p>
 
                   <p>The committee then examined other codes including: </p>
 
                   <p>The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, The IEEE 
 
                     Code of Ethics, Project Management Institute Code of Ethics 
 
                     for the Project Management Profession,. American Institute 
 
                     of Certified Public Accountants Professional Standards Manual, 
 
                     PA State Registration Board of Professional Engineers, Land 
 
                     Surveyors and Geologists The Code of Ethics and the Law, and 
 
                     The Unwritten Laws of Engineering by W. J. King American Society 
 
                     of Mechanical Engineers. The members of the committee used 
 
                     these and other codes as models for elements that they thought 
 
                     ought to be included in a code of ethics for software engineers.</p>
 
                   <p>SECEv1 was then distributed beyond the committee for comment. 
 
                     In the light of those comments and further work by the committee, 
 
                     the structure of the code has been revised to reflect more 
 
                     closely some significant aspects of other engineering and 
 
                     computing codes that were not included in SECEv1.</p>
 
                   <p>Many codes, such as the British Computer Society's Code of 
 
                     Conduct and Code of Practice, and the ACM's Code of Ethics 
 
                     and Professional conduct, include a preamble describing the 
 
                     roles and functions of the code for the practicing professional. 
 
                     These generally include a description of the use of the code 
 
                     and some very high level ethical imperatives. They also make 
 
                     clear that codes of ethics are to be used as guidelines for 
 
                     conduct and not as exhaustive lists of the ethical obligations 
 
                     of professionals. For example the preamble to the British 
 
                     Computer Society Code of Practice states &quot;The Code is 
 
                     to be viewed as a whole. Individual parts are not intended 
 
                     to be used in isolation to justify errors of omission or commission. 
 
                     The Code is intended to be observed in the spirit and not 
 
                     merely in the word.&quot; One of the ways to avoid this misunderstanding 
 
                     of reading the code as an ethics checklist is to organize 
 
                     the code into a hierarchy of Cannons, Rules, Principles, or 
 
                     Ethical Imperatives which form the top level of a hierarchy 
 
                     and attach at lower levels guidelines which by way of example 
 
                     make clear the intent of the top level principles. The structure 
 
                     of SECEv1 has been revised in accordance with this model. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>SECEv2 starts with a preamble explaining the roles and functions 
 
                     of the code. The Preamble is followed by a set of 7 principles 
 
                     based on the relationship in which a software engineer has 
 
                     ethical obligations. These principles are tied to key words 
 
                     indicating the relationship. The use of key words is a powerful 
 
                     memory guide for the code. Limiting the main body of the code 
 
                     to these seven principles will make it easier to remember 
 
                     and make the code more reflective of the impact of changing 
 
                     technology on the breadth of ethical obligations of the practicing 
 
                     software engineer. For each principle there are several specific 
 
                     examples (many drawn from other codes) which show what these 
 
                     principles require when put in practice. This division of 
 
                     the code makes it consistent with the three levels of professional 
 
                     obligation defined in &quot;Functions of Codes of Ethics&quot;(attached), 
 
                     namely the code contains level 1 ethical obligations based 
 
                     on the humanity of the professional, level 2 ethical obligation 
 
                     based on the higher order of care due by all professionals, 
 
                     and level 3 obligations which are tied directly to the practice 
 
                     of the profession. </p>
 
                   <p>As other professions have realized, in developing a code 
 
                     one cannot leave out obligations that are common to all professions 
 
                     and only consider level three- software engineering practice- 
 
                     obligations. To leave out level 1 and level 2 obligations 
 
                     reduces software engineering from a profession to a technical 
 
                     practice The revised structure of SECEv1 makes the code comprehensive 
 
                     in that it includes both generic items and profession specific 
 
                     items. Anything short of this would be meaningless and useless 
 
                     in the emergence of software engineering as a profession. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>The following table compares 12 different codes of ethics, 
 
                     conduct and practice to the preliminary version of the Software 
 
                     Engineering Code of Ethics(SECEv1). In the 12 codes, four 
 
                     are from computer organizations, five from engineering organizations 
 
                     and the IEEE code which also covers the IEEE-CS.</p>
 
                   <p>The original purpose of documenting the architecture of the 
 
                     code to show which parts are derived from other codes and 
 
                     which parts are unique to software engineering presumed that 
 
                     there are clear lines of demarcation between engineering, 
 
                     computing, and software engineering. The results of this study 
 
                     into computing and engineering codes of ethics are not consistent 
 
                     with that presumption. </p>
 
                   <p>Several studies have shown that codes of ethics operate on 
 
                     many levels.</p>
 
                   <p> On the highest level-imperatives grounded in our common 
 
                     humanity-- most codes contain ethical principles of honesty 
 
                     and integrity(Level 1).</p>
 
                   <p> SECEv1 has this kind of imperative in common with all of 
 
                     the other codes examined. Professional codes of ethics also 
 
                     have in common the professional's commitment to a higher level 
 
                     of care(Level 2). These obligations of all professions and 
 
                     practicing professionals are stated in terms of commitment 
 
                     to the public interest over self-interest. Again all of the 
 
                     codes have similar imperatives about professionals having 
 
                     a higher order of obligation to the public they serve rather 
 
                     than having the kind of moral obligation demanded of the general 
 
                     public. </p>
 
                   <p>The major difference between codes occurs at level 3; the 
 
                     statement of obligations specific to a particular profession. 
 
                     Some imperative may be stated in terms of level 1 in one code 
 
                     while they are stated at level 3 in another code. For example 
 
                     Rule 7 of SECEv1 is compared with IEEE 6. IEEE 6 states the 
 
                     professional obligation &quot;...to maintain and improve technical 
 
                     competence and to undertake technological tasks for others 
 
                     only if qualified by training or experience.&quot; while Rule 
 
                     7 addresses the same moral obligation at level 3 and talks 
 
                     about more specific competencies within the practice of software 
 
                     engineering. 7.0-7.6 are software engineering specific (level 
 
                     3) obligations to maintain knowledge in particular software 
 
                     engineering areas. Most of the cross references for 7.0-7.6 
 
                     refer to a single level 2 admonition to keep current in your 
 
                     profession. The difference between codes occurring primarily 
 
                     at level 3 also helps explain the sparse number of cross references 
 
                     to Rule 1 SECEv1 which is software product specific.</p>
 
                   <p>Most of the imperatives in SECv1 are in several of the codes 
 
                     of ethics used for comparisons. At the moment some imperatives 
 
                     are contained mostly in engineering codes (the outer columns 
 
                     of the chart) and some imperatives are contained mostly in 
 
                     computing codes (the inner columns of the chart). Those elements 
 
                     which currently are sparsely reflected in engineering and 
 
                     computer codes have to do with management issues and some 
 
                     very specific imperatives, some of which are technical issues 
 
                     in software engineering. As the code develops, to include 
 
                     elements that recognize the role of teams in software engineering, 
 
                     there will be more elements at level 3 which distinguish SECEv2 
 
                     from both computing and engineering codes. </p>
 
                   <p> Explanation of the table: The first column refers to sections 
 
                     of the SECv1. Only those items which closely matched the statements 
 
                     in SECv1 are referenced. If the referenced item in the other 
 
                     code is almost a direct quotation, then the reference appears 
 
                     in single quotes.</p>

                     If the document was not divided into sections, its paragraphs 
 
                     were simply numbered sequentially starting with 1. If the 
 
                     code was divided into sections and paragraphs, The paragraphs 
 
                     were given an alphabetical designation and the paragraphs 
 
                     within each section were numbered sequentially starting with 
 
                     1. </p>
