         <strong>Preamble</strong><br>
         In their professional activities, computer scientists interact with
           manifold aspects of life in our society and the laws and standards
           governing it. To
     take into account the special nature and diversity these is both their duty
     and their express wish. Accordingly, these guidelines are not formulated
           merely as ethical demands; they are, at the same time, the expression
           of this group's
     common will to view such interaction as
     an integral part of their professional activities at both an individual and
     institutional level. The choice of the term 'guidelines' underscores the
           open nature of these demands.</p>
       <p>The aim of the Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI) in issuing these guidelines
         is to set in motion a process of reflection on and response to conflicts
         relating to professional ethics. It is the GI's specific concern to support
         those of its members who, by acting responsibly, have drawn public attention
         or criticism. Above all, the GI wishes to initiate a public discourse
         on ethical questions in computer science and contribute to this discourse
         in an advisory and instructive capacity.</p>
       <p>It is an important task in our computerized world to address, in an
         interdisciplinary manner, the issue of the options for action open to
         us and the likely consequences ensuing from them. But this is something
         that we, as individuals, are normally unable to accomplish. That is why
         the GI considers it imperative to focus on the connections between individual
         and collective responsibility and to develop ways of making such connections
         explicit. To this extent, the GI engages to observe the following guidelines.<br>
   <br>
   <strong>I. Members</strong></p>
       <p>
     Art.1 Specialist Competence- Members are expected to constantly improve their
     own specialist competence in step with scientific and technological development.</p>
       <p>
         Art. 2 Application Competence- Members are expected, above and beyond
             their specialist competence, to familiarize themselves with those
             computer applications
     impinging
     on their own professional
       sphere such that they are able to understand the relationship existing
             between them. This presumes a willingness to understand and give
             consideration to
       the concerns and interests of the various persons and groups affected.</p>
       <p>Art. 3 Legal Competence Members are expected to be conversant with the
         relevant legal provisions, to observe them and contribute to their continuing
         revision and amendment.</p>
       <p>Art. 4 Communicative Competence and Discernment Members are expected
         to develop their own capacity for communication and discernment so as
         to enable them to participate, as computer professionals, in design activities
         and interdisciplinary discussions in pursuance of a collective code of
       ethics.</p>
       <p>
       <strong>II. Members in Senior Position</strong></p>
       <p>
         Art. 5 Working Conditions Members in senior positions are additionally
           expected to ensure that the working conditions of computer professionals
           are such as
     to enable them to subject their own work to critical scrutiny by reference
     to the current state of the art.</p>
       <p>Art. 6 Participation Members in senior positions are additionally expected
         to help ensure that the persons and groups affected by the introduction
         of computer systems are given ample opportunity to participate in the
         design of such systems and in the shaping of the conditions in which
         they are used. In particular, they are expected to ensure that no monitoring
         or surveillance systems are installed without prior consultation of those
         affected.</p>
       <p>Art. 7 Organizational Structures members in senior positions are additionally
         expected to actively foster organizational structures and communicative
         processes enabling individuals to assume responsibility in terms of a
       collective code of ethics.</p>
       <p>
       <strong>III. Members Engaged in Teaching and Research</strong></p>
       <p>
         Art. 8 Members engaged in teaching computer science are additionally
           expected both to prepare their students to assume responsibility individually
           and collectively,
     and to set a good example by their own personal behaviour and action.</p>
       <p>
         <strong>IV. The Gesellschaft fur Informatik</strong> </p>
       <p>Art. 9 Standing
         Up For One's Convictions The GI encourages its members to stand up for
         their
         convictions in situations where their duty towards
           their
       employer
       or a client conflicts with their responsibility towards the persons or
           groups affected.</p>
       <p> 
   Art. 10 Mediation The GI will assume the role of mediator in cases of conflict,
     if so requested by the persons or groups involved.</p>
       <p>Art. 11 Interdisciplinary Discourses The GI will provide for and promote
         interdisciplinary discourses on ethical problems relating to computer
         science; the question of which topics are to be addressed will also be
         decided in the context of such discourses. Suggestions may be put forward
         by individual members or groups of the GI. The results of such discourses
         will be made public.</p>
       <p>Art. 12 Casebook The GI will compile a generally accessible casebook
       on ethical conflicts, which will be annotated and regularly updated.</p>
       <p>
         Art. 13 Board of Governors These ethical guidelines will support the
             Board of Governors in its duties and decision?making in accordance
             with par 9 of
     the
     GI's Statutes.</p>
       <p>
         Art. 14 Revisions and Amendments These ethical guidelines will be regularly
       revised and amended.</p>
       <p><strong>Explanatory Notes</strong></p>
       <p>Person Affected<br>
   The data protection laws define this term as the natural person about whom
     data give information. It covers both persons in their capacity as members
     of organizations (employees, users) and non?members of organizations acting
     in a private capacity (citizens, clients). It is recommended that this commonly
     accepted term be adopted for all contexts in which computer systems are used.
     The distinction between &quot;user&quot; (member of an organization) and &quot;usee&quot; (non?member
     of an organization) commonly made in the English? speaking community has
     not yet gained acceptance in Germany.</p>
       <p>
         <strong>Discourse</strong><br>
         Discourses are processes of common reflection on problems involving norms
         or ethical values which are too complex to be resolved by individuals
         or a single
   specialist discipline. Their most important function is to initiate a process
   of interdisciplinary communication with a view to overcoming the existing boundaries
   of our knowledge and understanding; and to question existing prejudices (which
   are then either borne out or modified in the light of other opinions) so as
   to enable agreement to be reached. The mere problem of overcoming language
   barriers is proving to be a long and complicated matter, and it is therefore
   advisable to schedule the duration of such discourses for a medium?term period.</p>
       <p>
         <strong>Casebook</strong><br>
         Casebook is taken to mean a record of actual cases in which persons (chiefly
   computer scientists) acting in a professional capacity have run into ethical
   conflicts as a result of the duties or tasks entrusted to them. The GI Working
   Group on &quot;Computers and Responsibility&quot; undertakes to compile and
   annotate such cases. The casebook is intended to provide a concrete background
   for these guidelines and to help convey their importance and utility by furnishing
   practical examples of their potential application.
         Individuals
     in similar situations can consult these examples and derive from them guidelines
     for their own behaviour and action.</p>
       <p><strong>Computer System</strong><br>
         Computer system is taken to mean the aggregate of hardware, software
             and network components, including all design and training processes
             implied or entailed
       by it with respect to work and organization.</p>
       <p><strong>Collective Ethics</strong><br>
         Ethics are concerned with the deliberate action of human beings who
           reflect on the consequences of this action for other human beings,
           their fellow creatures
     and the environment in previously unexperienced situations not yet governed
     by moral and legal norms. This may involve reflection on the consequences
           of action in a direct and immediate context, or on its long?term or
           broad repercussions.
     Reflections of the individual on such consequences of action belong to the
     realm of individual ethics.</p>
       <p>The consequences of collective action (in organizations, groups, economic
         communities and cultures) are, however, frequently too complex to be
         properly understood by the individual. Collective action must, then,
         also be subjected to collective reflection. Collective ethics are based
         on the option of reflecting jointly and circumspectly on the consequences
         of future collective action that is unable to draw on past experience
         or on any norms thus derived. There is a specific need for such reflection
         in cases where individual ethics or morals are at variance with collective
       ethics.</p>
       <p><strong>Monitoring and Surveillance Systems</strong><br>
         Following the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz (German Labour Management Act),
           monitoring and surveillance systems are defined as &quot;technical
           facilities&quot; objectively
   amenable to utilization &quot;for monitoring the behaviour or performance of
   workers and employees&quot; (7 87 Par. 1 No. 6 BetrVG). Codetermination rights
   may be exercised by the bodies representing workers' interests in cases where
   it is intended to install such systems.</p>
       <p><strong>Mediation</strong><br>
         Mediation is taken to mean the negotiation processes by means of which
             conflicts of interest between two or more parties are settled by
             consulting a neutral
     third party (mediator). The objective here is to arrive at solutions that
             are acceptable to all sides. The mediation process is characterized
             by exploration
     of existing scope for action and the search for new solutions. The results
     of this process are not legally binding; generally speaking, the most successful
     solutions are those where all sides are felt to have 'won'.</p>
       <p><strong>Legal Provisions</strong><br>
         Today, legislation contains numerous provisions pertaining to or impinging
           on the design of computer systems. The most important of these are:<br>
         * General and application?specific data protection, including worker
           and<br>
         employee data protection<br>
         * Freedom of information legislation (laws governing access to information,
         e.g., in the environmental sector)<br>
       * Criminal law pertaining to the use of computers
      <br>
     * Laws governing the protection of industrial property, in particular<br>
     copyright and patent laws<br>
     * General civil and strict product liability<br>
     * IT security laws<br>
     * Laws pertaining to telecommunications - In many, though by no means all,
     cases the observance of technical norms and standards (DIN, EN, ISO) implies
       compliance with existing laws.</p>
       <p><strong>State of the Art in Science and Technology</strong><br>
         These guidelines would be obsolete immediately upon their promulgation
       if they were applied to an already existing body of knowledge in computer
       science.
       The alternative to citing rigid provisions is to adopt the principle of
       so?called open normative standards opted for by German technical security
       law. The
       Federal
       Constitutional Court has expounded this principle in a number of fundamental
       rulings in terms of a so?called &quot;Three?Stage Doctrine&quot; (BVerfGE
       49, 89 ff.; BVerfGE 53, 30 ff.; BVerfGE 56, 54 ff.). </p>
       <p><strong>1st Stage: Generally Accepted Principles and Standards in Technology</strong></p>
       <p>A principle or standard is considered to be generally accepted if the
         majority of practitioners working in a particular field are convinced
         of its correctness and have documented this conviction. The principle
         or standard must be practically proven and tested. Decisive here is the
         representative opinion of the body of practitioners as a whole; divergent
         views of minority groups are of no significance. General acceptance is
         strongly implied, for example, by the existence of DIN or ISO norms for
       the problem in hand.</p>
       <p><strong>2nd Stage: State of the Art in Technology</strong></p>
       <p>
         The criteria for deciding what measures are required are shifted to the
           forefront of technological development, where general acceptance and
           practical testing
   alone are insufficient. When this formula is applied, differences of opinion
   between technical practitioners must be explicitly identified. Most data protection
   laws contain a reference to the &quot;State of the Art in Technology (and Organization)&quot; in
   their data security provisions.</p>
       <p><strong>3rd Stage: State of the Art in Science and Technology</strong></p>
       <p>Reference to this formula involves an even greater commitment to ensuring
         that a standard keeps abreast of developments in science and technology.
         The required measures are based on what is considered necessary in accordance
         with the latest scientific findings; they are not limited by what is
         currently technically feasible in the respective field. A reference to
         the &quot;State of the Art in Science and Technology&quot; is contained,
         for example, in the Product Liability Law of 1989, which is applicable
         at least to standard software. It is reasonable to apply particularly
         high standards as far as the specialist competence of computer scientists
         is concerned (3rd stage). When constructing computer systems, it ought
         to be generally sufficient to comply at least with the standards expected
       of computer scientists in the data protection laws, for example.</p>
