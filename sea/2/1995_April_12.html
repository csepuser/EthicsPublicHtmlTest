       <p>Why have you selected that group (the Task Force on Software Engineering
         Ethics and Professional Practices?
       <p>One reason, of course, is that its domain corresponds most closely to
         the longterm workof CSEP (and the expertise of the principal investigators).
         We are an ethics center, not (likeCarnegie-Mellon's Institute for Software
         Engineering) a center concerned with purely technical standards. Of the
         three task forces, we are most likely to be both' effective researchers
         and effective participants in this one. We have chosen the task force
         that speaks our language. </p>
       <p>A second reason is that the cooperation of two powerful professions
         (electrical engineering and computer science) creates a field with fewer
         settled questions than is usually the case when a new profession (say,
         environmental engineering) simply branches off. Engineers and computer
         scientists are similar enough to understand each other, yet different
         enough to require an explicitness about professional matters not necessary
         within a profession unified by history.</p>
       <p>What models for technical standards and ethical standards will prevail?
         On the one hand, engineering's longer history and its traditional concern
         with safety might give its standards overwhelming weight. On the other
         hand, the ACM has included &quot;Organizational Leadership Imperatives&quot; in
         its code, reflecting an approach that puts the organizational context
         of practice at less distance than that of the engineers' codes. The SEEPP
         effort may give us evidence of whether an approach that brings employers
         and even customers into the picture is gaining ground. (See SEI's Capability
         Maturity Model.).2</p>
       <p><br>
   At present software developers lacking an ABET-approved engineering degree
     are barred in at least 48 states from presenting themselves to the public
     as software engineers. This is a refusal to recognize software engineering
     degrees awarded by computer science departments. An interpretation in terms
     of the received wisdom about professions is that this is a turf issue. Yet
     it might reflect a genuine disagreement with regard to standards or education.
     Will members of the task force be surprised from time to time by the standards
     members of the other profession take for granted? Will the computer science
     people take pains to
   appropriate the presumed sophistication of technical engineering standards?
   Will there be significant disagreement requiring accommodation on both sides
   with regard to education, standards, or both?</p>
       <p>A third reason is that we are in a position to confirm, or disconfirm,
         certain views of professions, especially of their codes of ethics, common
         in the literature of professions. For example, it is common to claim
         that codes are meant to
   serve the profession at the expense of the public, that they are designed not
   to be followed but to hoodwink the public, that they are meant to protect the
   powerful within the profession from the upstarts, or that they are a conspiracy
   against an otherwise fair market. Such claims, common in the sociology of professions,
   do not seem to rest on a careful study of the process by which professions
   in fact come into existence (in part, no doubt, because that process is seldom
   well-documented). [Cf. Margali Larson, etc.] </p>
       <p>We have an opportunity to study how the required professional education
         of software developers is determined. The received account depicts the
         professions seeking status within universities and constructing their
         bodies of knowledge as the &quot;science&quot; on which the-profession
         depends. In this instance, the actual discussion can enlighten us about
         how the training is conceived in relation to the demands of practice
         and of the marketplace. Just as important, it can<br>
   reveal the degree to which ethical considerations inform the determination
   about what the training should include, in either computer science or electrical
   engineering departments.</p>
       <p>Is this effort likely to tell us something important about professions
         in relationship to society? </p>
       <p>Our hypothesis is that most arguments, especially those generally treated
         as legitimate, will fall into one the following categories: a) those
         that appeal to what's practical (what can you really expect people like
         us to do?); b) those that appeal to the public welfare (or, at least,
         the welfare of employers and users); c) those that appeal to what the
         public (or, at least employers<br>
   and users) want (whether it's good for them or not); and d) those concerned
   with consistency between software developers and those with whom they work
   or want to be allied (for example, the standards of the ACM or IEEE). Davis
   has, of course, long argued for something like this interpretation of codes.
   But, until now, he has had to do so using the codes themselves, explaining
   what they actually say in less jaundiced terms than has been common or pointing
   to the direction.3<br>
   of change over time. That, of course, is not nearly so satisfactory a way to
   counter the common view as simply saying, &quot;Here's the debate: where are
   the selfish interests?&quot;</p>
       <p>Our method will be a) to identify (kinds of) argument made to justify
         shaping the standards this way rather that and b) to gauge what part
         they play in the process (e.g., how often they are made, how often treated
         as decisive, respectable,
   woolly, or beyond the-pale). We will, in short, be doing simple content analysis.</p>
       <p>While we do have a hypothesis, we are on a &quot;fishing expedition&quot;--and
         should be proud of it. Our chosen task force has had a slow start (despite
         the co-chairs' efforts). We are already wondering whether starting a
         new profession, even with adequate resources, might be considerably harder
         than the standard literature led us to expect. That is something we will
         want to pay attention to. We hope for more such surprises.</p>
