                   <p>Software Engineering Ethics Code<br>
 
                     Don gotterbarn, Keith Miller, Simon Rogerson</p>
 
                   <p>In May of 1993, the Board of Governors of the IEEECS established 
 
                     a steering committee for evaluating, planning, and coordinating 
 
                     actions related to establishing software engineering as a 
 
                     profession. In that same year the ACM Council endorsed the 
 
                     establishment of a Commission on Software Engineering. By 
 
                     January of 1994, both<br>
 
                     societies formed a joint committee &quot;To establish the 
 
                     appropriate set(s) of standards for professional practice 
 
                     of Software Engineering upon which industrial decisions, professional 
 
                     certification, and educational curricula can be based.&quot; 
 
                     To accomplish these tasks they made the following recommendations:<br>
 
                     1. adopt standard definitions,<br>
 
                     2. define required body of knowledge and recommended practices<br>
 
                     3. define ethical standards<br>
 
                     4. define educational curricula for undergraduate, graduate(MS) 
 
                     and continuing education (for retraining and migration).</p>
 
                   <p>The steering committee decided to accomplish these tasks 
 
                     through the establishment of a series of task forces. Initially 
 
                     the task forces established were: Software Engineering body 
 
                     of knowledge and recommended practices: Software Engineering 
 
                     ethics and professional practices, and Software Engineering 
 
                     curriculum.</p>
 
                   <p>The purpose of the ethics task force is to document the ethical 
 
                     and professional responsibilities and obligations of software 
 
                     engineers. This draft code of ethics was developed by a task 
 
                     force of the Joint IEEE Computer Society and Association for 
 
                     Computing Machinery Steering Committee for the Establishment 
 
                     of Software Engineering as a Profession. The task force on 
 
                     Software Engineering Ethics and<br>
 
                     Professional Practices developed this code for a subspecialization 
 
                     within the constituencies of both of the professional societies. 
 
                     In an attempt to reflect the international character of both 
 
                     organizations and the profession itself, the composition of 
 
                     the task force is multinational in both citizenship and in 
 
                     membership in professional computing organizations. The proposed 
 
                     draft Code of Ethics for Software Engineers ( version 2.1 
 
                     ) was developed by the task force and reviewed<br>
 
                     by the Steering Committee for distribution and comment as 
 
                     a preliminary draft. The intent of this distribution is to 
 
                     solicit comments from practitioners and other interested parties. 
 
                     &lt; OK -&gt;</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     Based on the feedback from readers of this publication and 
 
                     from other sources, a final draft of the code will be developed 
 
                     and presented to the Steering Committee for approval. </p>
 
                   <p>DRAFT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS</p>
 
                   <p>PREAMBLE v 2.1</p>
 
                   <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, 
 
                     industry, government, medicine, education, entertainment, 
 
                     social affairs, and ordinary life. Those who contribute, by 
 
                     direct participation or by teaching, to the design and development 
 
                     of software systems have significant opportunities both to 
 
                     do good and to cause harm and to influence and enable others 
 
                     to do good or cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, 
 
                     that this power will be used for good, software engineers 
 
                     must commit themselves to making the design and development 
 
                     of software a beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance 
 
                     with that commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the 
 
                     following Code of ethics.</p>
 
                   <p>The Code contains eight keyword principles related to the 
 
                     behavior of and decisions made by professional software engineers, 
 
                     be they practitioners, educators, managers and supervisors, 
 
                     or policy makers, as well as trainees and students of the 
 
                     profession. The Principles identify the various relationships 
 
                     in which individuals, groups, and organizations participate 
 
                     and the primary obligations within these relationships.</p>
 
                   <p>Each principle of this code addresses three levels of ethical 
 
                     obligation owed by professional software engineers in each 
 
                     of these relationships. The first level identified is a set 
 
                     of ethical values which they share with all other human beings 
 
                     by virtue of their humanity. The second level obliges professionals 
 
                     to a higher order of care for those who may be affected by 
 
                     their work. The third and deeper level comprises several obligations 
 
                     which derive directly from elements unique to the professional 
 
                     practice of software engineering. The `louses of each principle 
 
                     are illustrations of the various levels of obligation included 
 
                     in teat relationship.</p>
 
                   <p>The clauses under each Principle consist of three different 
 
                     types of statement corresponding to each level. Level One: 
 
                     Aspire (to be human); Statements of aspiration provide vision 
 
                     and objectives, are intended to direct professional behavior. 
 
                     These directives require significant ethical judgment. Level 
 
                     Two: Expect (to be professional); Statements of expectation 
 
                     express the obligations of all professionals and professional 
 
                     attitudes. Again they do not describe the specific behavior 
 
                     details but they clearly indicate professional responsibilities 
 
                     in computing. Level Three: Demand (to use good practices); 
 
                     Statements of demand assert more specific behavioral responsibilities 
 
                     within software engineering which are more closely related 
 
                     to the current state of the art. The range of statements is 
 
                     from the more general aspirational statement to specific measurable 
 
                     requirements.</p>
 
                   <p>Although all levels of professional obligation are recognized 
 
                     and because the Code contains different types of statements, 
 
                     the code is not intended to be all inclusive nor is it intended 
 
                     that its individual parts be used in isolation to justify 
 
                     errors of omissions or commission. The list of Principles 
 
                     and Clauses is not exhaustive, and should not be read as separating 
 
                     the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct 
 
                     in all practical situations. The Code is not a simple ethical 
 
                     algorithm which generates ethical decisions. In some situations 
 
                     standards may conflict with each other or with standards from 
 
                     other sources. These situations require the software engineer 
 
                     to use ethical judgment to act in a manner which is most consistent 
 
                     with the spirit of the code of ethics, given the circumstances.</p>
 
                   <p>These ethical tensions can best be answered by thoughtful 
 
                     consideration of fundamental principles, rather than reliance 
 
                     on detailed regulations. These Principles should influence 
 
                     you to consider broadly who is affected by your work; to examine 
 
                     if you and your colleagues are treating other human beings 
 
                     with due respect; to speculate on how the public would view 
 
                     your decision if they were reasonably well informed; to analyze 
 
                     how the least empowered will be affected by your decision; 
 
                     and to consider if your acts would be considered worthy of 
 
                     the ideal professional working as a software engineer. Since 
 
                     this code represents a consensus of those engaged in the profession 
 
                     one should take into account what is likely to be judged as 
 
                     the most ethical way to act in the circumstances by informed, 
 
                     respected, and experienced peers in possession of all the 
 
                     facts and only depart from such a course for profound reasons, 
 
                     backed with careful judgment.</p>
 
                   <p>The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering 
 
                     requires a code that is adaptable and relevant to new situations 
 
                     as they occur. But even in this generality, the code provides 
 
                     support for the software engineer who needs to take positive 
 
                     action by documenting the ethical stance of the profession; 
 
                     an ethical foundation to which individuals within teams and 
 
                     the team as a whole can appeal. The code also helps to define 
 
                     those things which are ethically improper to request of an 
 
                     software engineer.</p>
 
                   <p>The code has an educational function, stating what is required 
 
                     of anyone wishing to join or continue in the software engineering 
 
                     community. Because it expresses the consensus of the profession 
 
                     on ethical issues it can be used as a guide to decision making 
 
                     and as means to educate both the public and aspiring professionals 
 
                     about the professional obligation of. all software engineers</p>
 
                   <p>PRINCIPLES v 2.1</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 1: PRODUCT. Software engineers shall, insofar as 
 
                     possible, assure that the software on which they work is useful 
 
                     and of acceptable quality to the public, the employer, the 
 
                     client, and the user, completed on time and at reasonable 
 
                     cost, and free of error. In particular, software engineers 
 
                     shall, as appropriate:</p>
 
                   <p>1.01. Ensure that specifications for software on which they
