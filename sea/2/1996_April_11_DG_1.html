   From: Diane Crawford &lt;Crawfordd@NY.hq.acm.org&gt;<br>
   Subject: RE: Joint ACM-IEEE Software issue<br>
   To: N Jayaram &lt;jayaramn@westminster.ac.uk&gt;<br>
       </p>
       <p>Dear Dr. Jayaram:</p>
       <p>Thank you for your proposal and your interest in working with CACM on
         joint editorial project with IEEE. I am very intrigued by the topic and
         the international scope of the proposal, however, please know that the
         formats you have in mind are really not ones adaptable to CACM.</p>
       <p>Our readers want more diversity from us, which is why as of January
         1996 we have eliminated the format of full issues on one topic. We only
         focus on a monthly special section which allows us to devote half of
         each issue to a series of stand-alone articles on a variety of topics.
         Readership feedback indicates this editorial change is working wonderfully,
         so we are planning on sticking with it.</p>
       <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss one special section (see
         guidelines) with you or--even better---I would encourage a series of
         articles that we can run as stand-alones throughout the year. We are
         very interested in getting solid articles on international developments,
         so it's material I would like to run on a fairly regular basis rather
         than in one single issue.</p>
       <p>As far as coordinating with IEEE, personally, this is not a practice
         I would like to resurrect. (and I have a feeling IEEE would agree). I
         know this was occasionally done between ACM and IEEE several years ago,
         but things are different now. There are advertising dollars to consider
         and very different readerships to address.</p>
       <p>I am forwarding here our author guidelines which should give you a basic
         idea about the current CACM audience dynamics and interests as well as
         some general info on article preparation. If you are interested in pursuring
         either of these routes, I would be pleased to discuss them further with
         you at any time.</p>
       <p>Thanks again for your interest.</p>
       <p>Regards,</p>
       <p>Diane</p>

       <p>COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS</p>
       <p>&nbsp; </p>
       <p>SELECTION OF MANUSCRIPTS<br>
   Communications of the ACM is a monthly magazine with a readership of 83,000
     computing professionals. The majority of readers have been involved in the
     computing industry for over 12 years, and 61% have advanced degrees. Of these
     readers, 67% are computing practitioners who work in industry, 14% work in
     government and 19% work in academia. </p>
       <p>The Communications readership represents professionals from every known
         computing discipline. Therefore, it is imperative that submitted articles
         address a broad-based audience. Unsolicited manuscripts are selected
         for review on the basis of a significant and general interest to these
         readers. Articles that have clearly been written for a specific special
         interest or niche group will be returned. Authors are strongly encouraged
         to develop a familiarity with the editorial style and format of Communications
         prior to manuscript preparation. Moreover, submissions must adhere to
         these author guidelines. </p>
       <p>The editorial categories for consideration include general interest
         articles, case studies, and special sections. There are also several
         channels for expressions of opinion and technical commentary. All submissions
         that do not follow these guidelines will be immediately returned. Authors
         are strongly encouraged to read Communications to understand what is
         currently being published for its target readership. </p>
       <p>General interest articles: These articles (4,000 words max.) cover material
         of substance and emphasize concepts and principles. An article sets the
         background, defines fundamental concepts, compares alternate approaches,
         and explains the significance or application of a particular theory or
         result by means of well-written text and pertinent graphical material.
         Reference lists (25 max.) should indicate the most significant items
         that support and substantiate the article. All submissions in this category
         are reviewed for technical accuracy, importance to the field, appropriateness
         to the audience, and effectiveness of style and presentation. </p>
       <p>Case studies: Case studies are articles reporting on experiences gained
         and lessons learned constructing and using major computer systems. They
         take a comprehensive view of selected systems, covering them from requirements
         through design, implementation, and use. Case studies should take a rigorously
         objective perspective on the systems they describe, and should be both
         evaluative and descriptive. Persons interested in working on case studies
         are advised to consult the executive editor. </p>
       <p>Special sections: Special sections are collections of articles on a
         specific topic. Persons interested in serving as guest editors or in
         proposing special sections should submit to the executive editor a brief
         abstract outlining the goals and content of this section as well a description
         of the potential articles to be included. The proposal should also include
         reasons why the topic is appropriate for the Communications audience. </p>
       <p>The number of articles in a special section should not exceed the combined
         length of five feature articles (20,000 words.) We encourage a sampling
         of short, sidebar-like articles (500 to 1,000 words max) to complement
         the feature articles. Guest editors and Communications editors can work
         together to create the strongest mix of editorial possibilities. All
         material must be prepared according to these guidelines. For further
         details contact the executive editor.</p>
       <p>Signed commentaries: Viewpoint, Forum, and Technical Opinion sections
         are the three main channels by which opinions are expressed in Communications.
         Viewpoints (1,000 words) are carefully reasoned commentaries in which
         all positions are substantiated by facts or principled arguments. They
         pertain to any topic relevant to the computing field. Forum letters (600
         words) comment on any timely subject. Technical Opinions (1,000 words)
         are treated as informal commentary on technical matters. </p>
       <p>Because of limited space, Communications cannot publish all submitted
         commentaries. Preference will be given to items that open new discussions
         or add significant new points to previous discussions.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION<br>
   ACM is in the early stages of installing an electronic publishing environment.
     For the time being, we will still be accepting hard copies of all initial
     submissions, if only for use as back up material for electronic versions.
     For authors working on special sections or solicited material, it is best
     to discuss the submission format with the Communications editor assigned
     to the project. For authors working on unsolicited material, we request five
     hard copies of the article, double-spaced throughout the text, tables, figure
     legends and references. </p>
       <p>All submissions may use a minimum of unnumbered section titles; additional
         subheads will likely be eliminated. All tables of data must indicate
         the source(s) of the data. Mathematical expressions and notations should
         be used judiciously. The article headline must be short (7 word max.)
         and indicate the general subject of the article. Manuscripts must not
         exceed the 4,000 maximum word allotment. </p>
       <p>References: References (25 citations max.) of previous work or work
         cited should be included at the end of the article. References must be
         ordered alphabetically by first author (see reference style box) and
         must not exceed 25. </p>
       <p>Artwork: Final artwork does not need to be included with the first draft
         of the manuscript, clear sketches and accurate graphs are sufficient
         for the review process. Upon acceptance of the article, authors will
         be contacted as to the most appropriate way to submit final artwork.
         Any artwork that has been derived from sources other than the author's
         own must be accompanied by an appropriate letter of permission and source
         citation.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>SUBMISSIONS AND THE REVIEW PROCESS<br>
   Five copies of the double-spaced manuscript should be submitted to the Executive
     Editor of Communications of the ACM, 1515 Broadway, New York, NY 10036. To
     ensure a submission is considered expeditiously, a cover letter must be included
     and contain these components:</p>
       <p>1. Title and the central claim of the article<br>
   2. Statement addressing why the material is important in its field and why
     the material should be published in Communications<br>
   3. Names, addresses and telephone numbers of three or more recognized experts
   who would be appropriate reviewers for the submission. The editors will select
   reviewers from these and other experts in the field.</p>
       <p> On receipt, manuscripts will be screened by staff members in consultation
         with editorial panel members. Inappropriate submissions will be returned
         to authors within one month without a formal review. Factors leading
         to this action include excessive length, technically inappropriate material,
         subject not of interest to readers, resubmissions of previously rejected
         articles, manuscripts simultaneously submitted to other publications,
         and manuscripts not submitted according to author guidelines. </p>
       <p>Authors are notified of acceptance, rejection, or need for revision
         and resubmittance within 4 to 6 months. (Authors of articles slated for
         special section projects will be informed by HQ editors as to the review
         schedule) Authors desiring status reports can contact Communications's
         editorial assistant: cacmstat@acmvm.bitnet.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>ACCEPTED SUBMISSIONS<br>
   Authors are notified of an accepted submission by postal mail. Authors are
     required to sign an ACM copyright form. The copyright form indicates the
     author is either transferring copyright to ACM or declaring the article to
     be government-sponsored work in the public domain. (ACM copyright incorporates
     digital and print distribution factors, however, authors retain liberal reuse
     rights). The return of the copyright form, and letters of permission for
     nonoriginal artwork and photographs as well as source citation (if applicable),
     completes the acceptance process. </p>
       <p>Until completion of ACM's electronic publishing installation, we encourage
         submission of the final draft of an accepted article in electronic plaintext
         form--via email or on disk--however, a hard-copy version is required
         as backup. Art, tables, and figures may be submitted in hard-copy format
         or electronically via PICT files on a Mac-formatted disk. Authors should
         contact the Communications' staff to obtain more details on electronic
         submissions. </p>
       <p>Once an article is scheduled for publication it will be edited for substance
         and presentation by Communications' editors. All articles will also be
         copyedited to conform to The Chicago Manual of Style (The University
         of Chicago Press) as well as to the publication's own house style and
         format.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>ACM POLICY ON ORIGINAL PUBLICATION<br>
   It is ACM policy to be the sole, original publisher of articles and commentary.
     Articles that have been submitted simultaneously to other magazines or journals
     will be rejected outright and will not be reconsidered. Republication of
     an article, possibly revised, that has been disseminated via conference proceedings
     or newsletter is permitted if the editor of the publication to which it has
     been submitted judges there are significant additional benefits to be gained
     from publication. A conference chairperson can arrange with the executive
     editor to publish selected articles from professional conferences, after
     suitable refereeing. The articles must meet the editorial requirements for
     Communications. The full article may also appear in the proceedings with
     reference to the Communications. Acknowledgment of the originating conference
     will appear as a credit when the article is published in Communications.</p>

       <p></p>
       <p> Dear Dr Crawford:</p>
       <p> While sending the following message I forgot to mention that I am an
         ACM member and a SIGSOFT (UK) Chapter Chair-designate.</p>
       <p> Regards</p>
       <p> Narayan Jayaram</p>
       <p> ----------------------------------------------------------</p>
       <p> Dear Dr Davies and Dr Crawford:</p>
       <p> The IEEE CS and ACM are the two computer societies with membership
         in every country in the world. These two societies have joined together
         to establish software engineering as a profession. Towards this end,
         three task forces and a number of work groups are in operation in developing
         body of knowledge, ethics, professional practices and curricula details.</p>
       <p> We feel that time now ripe to provide a global forum to provide opportunity
         for the memberships -at- large to contribute, discuss and to sustain
         the awareness in the above initiative. There is no doubt that the IEEE
         Software and CACM together would form that forum. Hence we request you
         to consider one of the following for elaboration as formal proposal :</p>
       <p> - Joint CACM - IEEE Software Special Sections ( three issues)</p>
       <p> - Joint CACM - IEEE Special Issue</p>
       <p> We are working out the areas in which to i) solicit invited papers
         ii) call for papers. We would also like to include topics that require
         greater discussion and analysis - global dimension in software production,
         professional societies and certification, software engineering practices
         in informatics ( many in the area, including the those in Finance Sectors
         use CASE tools with linkage to databases ..), ...</p>
       <p> We propose three guest editors , each with the knowledge of professional
         practices of his region - Narayan Jayaram for Europe, Middle East and
         Africa, Ed Mechler for the Americas, and the third ( we would be in touch
         with the potential colleague shortly) for the Far East, Australia and
         NewZealand . Jayaram and Mechler are contributing in the Task Force on
         Ethics.</p>
       <p> We would appreciate you reaction to above. We would prepare the detailed
         proposal for submission if you feel that the above exercise is worth
         pursuing.</p>
       <p> With best regards</p>
       <p> Sincerely yours</p>
       <p> Narayana Jayaram</p>
       <p> Senior Lecturer and IEEE Computer Chapter (UKRI) Chair</p>
