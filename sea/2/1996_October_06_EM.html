                   <p>Ed,</p>
                   <p>Could you address the comments made below? Some are tough 
 
                     and general, and perhaps they cannot be addressed. Yet the 
 
                     more pointed ones would be nice to clarify and fix. Please 
 
                     let me know.</p>
 
                   <p> -- Felipe</p>
 
                   <p> ----------  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Here are my comments on the proposed code of ethics.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>In general, I think this expresses some good ideals, but 
 
                     is entirely  
 
                     impractical in a number of cases. The problem is that many 
 
                     of the things  
 
                     being proposed are vaguely defined, impossible to accomplish, 
 
                     or  
 
                     not under the control of the software engineer. A few others 
 
                     might  
 
                     not be generally accepted as the &quot;right&quot; thing to 
 
                     do.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>First The SE Code of Ethics was built using other professional 
 
                     codes as models. Ethics  
 
                     doesn't have a practical/impractical side that I have ever 
 
                     experienced. Usually, ethics are  
 
                     vaguely defined and are not under any one groups control. 
 
                     I don't think that any of the  
 
                     items are impossible to do as a professional. Finally, I'll 
 
                     give 100 to 1 odds that under any  
 
                     professional code there are items that some will think are 
 
                     not the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.  
 
                     Specific comments and suggestions are identified below.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>INTRODUCTION  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce,  
 
                     industry, government, medicine, entertainment, and ordinary 
 
                     life.  
 
                     Because the utility of computers depends in large part on 
 
                     the  
 
                     instructions written for them, those who design, develop, 
 
                     and  
 
                     test software have enormous opportunities both to do good 
 
                     and to  
 
                     cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, that this power 
 
                     will  
 
                     be used for good, software engineers commit themselves to 
 
                     making  
 
                     the design, development, and testing of software a distinct,  
 
                     beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance with that  
 
                     commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the following  
 
                     standards of conduct. The seven main paragraphs state general. 
 
                     rules.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>The following sentence makes no sense to me:  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Each subsidiary clause is a specific application of its  
 
                     general rule, one experience has shown needs express statement;  
 
                     but no set of subsidiary clauses exhausts the general rule.  
 
                     General disclaimer saying we cannot give all instances of 
 
                     a rule in ethics.  
 
                       
 
                       
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Rule 1: PRODUCT. Software engineers shall, insofar as possible,  
 
                     assure that the software on which they work is useful to public,  
 
                     employer, customer, and user, completed on time and at reasonable  
 
                     cost, and free of significant error. In particular, software  
 
                     engineers shall, as appropriate:  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.01. Assure that specifications for software on  
 
                     which they work have been put in writing,  
 
                     satisfy the user's requirements, and have the  
 
                     customer's approval.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>I see no reason why the ETHICS would require that specifications 
 
                     be  
 
                     put in writing. And I do not believe a software engineer is 
 
                     in a position  
 
                     to assure that specifications have met the other criteria. 
 
                     Examples:  
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>- you are brought in to fix something where you have(no) 
 
                     know knowledge  
 
                     of the history of its requirements  
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>- you are given the requirements by your organization and 
 
                     have no  
 
                     interface with the customer and do not know if the customer 
 
                     has  
 
                     approved  
 
                     Specs in writing could be put &quot;record specs&quot; but 
 
                     at present writing is the safest way of  
 
                     assuring transfer of data. The example given is one of the 
 
                     problems we are trying to  
 
                     decrease the occurrence of.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.02. Assure that they understand fully the  
 
                     specifications for software on which they work.  
 
                     Would that this were true. It never is in practice. Things 
 
                     are gray here.  
 
                     Again, as professionals, another area we are trying to decrease 
 
                     the occurrence of.  
 
                     Shouldn't we strive for better specs and be unethical if we 
 
                     didn't.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.04. Assure proper goals and objectives for any  
 
                     project on which they work.  
 
                     How can this be done? What is &quot;proper&quot;? By whose 
 
                     standards?.There seems to be a contradiction here - if standards, 
 
                     companys/industry, exist then  
 
                     &quot;proper&quot; is defined. These are not difficult to 
 
                     do, although we don't, if we follow project  
 
                     manage techniques.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.05. Assure proper development methodology on any  
 
                     project on which they work.  
 
                     Same question as above. See 1.04  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.06. Assure proper management on any project on  
 
                     which they work, including proper procedures  
 
                     for control of quality and risk.  
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>This is patently impossible. A software engineer is not in 
 
                     a position to  
 
                     assure anything about management unless they are the management.  
 
                     As any type of engineer I can assure proper mgmt of my responsible 
 
                     areas and shouldn't I  
 
                     report mismgmt.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.07. Assure proper estimates of cost, schedule,  
 
                     personnel, and outcome on any project on  
 
                     which they work.  
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Once again, what is &quot;proper&quot; and notwithstanding 
 
                     that, how can a software  
 
                     developer assure this in practice? Chances are they were added 
 
                     to the  
 
                     project long after estimates were done.  
 
                     Another area we are trying to decrease the occurrence of.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.08. Assure adequate documentation on any project  
 
                     on which they work, including a log of  
 
                     problems discovered and solutions adopted.  
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>This is determined by company processes and procedures and 
 
                     policies and  
 
                     specific customer requirmenets, not by software engineers 
 
                     desires.  
 
                     What is the problem? Why shouldn't a professional add to these 
 
                     in areas of their  
 
                     expertise?  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.09. Assure proper testing, debugging, and review  
 
                     of software and related documents on which  
 
                     they work.  
 
                     What is &quot;proper&quot;?  
 
                     See 1.04  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.10. Assure that software and related documents  
 
                     on which they work respect the privacy of  
 
                     those who will be subject to the software.  
 
                     This is vague and untestable. Who will be &quot;subject to 
 
                     the software&quot;?  
 
                     What does it mean to &quot;respect the privacy&quot;?  
 
                     This is an ethics statement not a program being written. I 
 
                     don't think it is vague but an  
 
                     assurance that the SE thinks about the privacy issue..   
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.11 Assure that raw information used in software  
 
                     is accurate, derives from a legitimate source,  
 
                     and is used only in ways properly authorized.  
 
                     Assurance may be difficult.  
 
                     It may be difficult but we owe it to the public and who we 
 
                     are doing the job for.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.12. Assure ethical, economic, cultural, legal,  
 
                     and environmental issues are properly  
 
                     identified, defined, and addressed.  
 
                     Few software engineers even know what these issues are.  
 
                     Then maybe they are not SEs and this is a goal we should be 
 
                     aiming for.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.13. Promote maximum productivity and minimum  
 
                     cost to employer, customer, user, and public.  
 
                     A nice ideal.  
 
                     Is the commentator saying we are not doing this now? Are we 
 
                     a group of cheats?  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.14. Avoid fads, departing from standard  
 
                     practices only when justified.  
 
                     This is a judgement call. Highly inappropriate in a code of 
 
                     ethics.  
 
                     Ethics is a set of principles or values that guide our judgments.  
 
                       
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Rule 2: PUBLIC. Software engineers shall, in their professional  
 
                     role, act only in ways consistent with the public safety, 
 
                     health  
 
                     and welfare. In particular, software engineers shall:  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons any danger  
 
                     that the software or related documents on  
 
                     which they work may pose to the user, a third  
 
                     party, or the environment.  
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>2.02. Approve software only if they have a well-documented  
 
                     belief that it is safe, meets specifications, and  
 
                     has passed all appropriate tests.  
 
                     This is too arbitrary. Why must their belief be well documented? 
 
                     Doesn't  
 
                     this depend on the intended use of the software? Doesn't &quot;safety&quot; 
 
                     also  
 
                     depend on the intended use?  
 
                     Again 1.14 response; taken from PE Code.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>2.03. Affix their signature only to documents  
 
                     prepared under their supervision and within  
 
                     their areas of competence.  
 
                     This would eliminate most documents one signs while seeking. 
 
                     employment, such as non-disclosure agreements and  
 
                     various employment condition documents, such as intellectual 
 
                     property  
 
                     rights agreements.  
 
                     I do not see what these examples have to do with Rule 2.  
 
                       
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>4.01. Provide service only in areas of competence.  
 
                     This would eliminate most practicing software engineers. I 
 
                     mean this.  
 
                     Who determines competence?  
 
                     The commentator paints a very bleak picture of our industry.  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>4.02. Assure that any document upon which they  
 
                     rely has been approved by someone qualified  
 
                     to approve it.  
 
                     And how are they to determine the qualifications of the person 
 
                     who  
 
                     approved a document that was prepared by another organization 
 
                     or  
 
                     a long time ago?  
 
                     See 1.14 response  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>-- (snip) ---  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>their opinion, a project is likely to fail,  
 
                     to prove too expensive, to violate copyright  
 
                     laws, or otherwise to turn out badly.  
 
                     I assume client means employer in most cases.  
 
                     Yes  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>-- snip --  
 
                       
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>7.01. Improve their knowledge of recent  
 
                     developments in the design, development, and  
 
                     testing of software and related documents.  
 
                     I don't see why this is required for them to be ethical.  
 
                     Ditto for the rest of this section. Sounds more like what 
 
                     one would  
 
                     expect for them to get a license, not to be considered ethical.  
 
                     In the fastest growing field today, and perhaps in history, 
 
                     this is definitely an ethical  
 
                     issue. I have met too many people giving advice and guidance 
 
                     who I hope were not up to  
 
                     date and not just lying
