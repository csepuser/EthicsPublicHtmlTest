                   <p>=========================== 5 ======= </p>
 
                   <p>This principle, as initially stated, has the goal of not 
 
                     bringing the profession into disrepute. In general, quality 
 
                     and safety over-rides to this principle. </p>
 
                   <p>Principle 5: PROFESSION.</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, in all professional matters, advance 
 
                     both the integrity and reputation of their profession(1) as 
 
                     is consistent with public health, safety, and welfare. In 
 
                     particular, software engineers shall, insofar as possible:</p>
 
                   <p> 5.01. Associate only with reputable businesses (2) and other 
 
                     organizations.</p>
 
                   <p> 5.02. Assure that clients, employers, and supervisors know 
 
                     of (3) the software engineer's commitment to this code of 
 
                     ethics. </p>
 
                   <p>5.03. Support those (4) who similarly do as this code requires. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>5.04. Help develop an organizational environment favorable 
 
                     to acting ethically. </p>
 
                   <p>5.05. Report violations of this code to appropriate authorities.</p>
 
                   <p> 5.06. Take responsibility for detecting, correcting, and 
 
                     reporting errors in software and associated documents on which 
 
                     they work. </p>
 
                   <p>5.07. Only accept (5) remuneration appropriate to professional 
 
                     qualifications (6) or experience. </p>
 
                   <p>5.08. Be accurate in stating the characteristics of software 
 
                     on which they work, avoiding not only false claims but claims 
 
                     that might reasonably be supposed to be deceptive, misleading, 
 
                     or doubtful.</p>
 
                   <p> 5.09. Not promote their own interest at the expense of the 
 
                     profession. </p>
 
                   <p>5.10. Obey all laws governing their work, insofar as such 
 
                     obedience is consistent with the public health, safety, and 
 
                     welfare.</p>
 
                   <p> 5.11. (7).Exercise professional responsibility to society 
 
                     by serving in civic affairs constructively </p>
 
                   <p>5.12. (8) Promote public knowledge of software engineering. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>5.13. Share useful software-related knowledge, inventions, 
 
                     or discoveries with the profession(9), for example, by presenting 
 
                     papers at professional meetings, by publishing articles in 
 
                     the technical press, and by serving on the profession's standard-setting 
 
                     bodies. (10) deleted clause </p>
 
                   <p>5.14. Make no political contribution, gift, or commission 
 
                     for award of a contract.</p>
 
                   <p>====================== 6 ================ </p>
 
                   <p>This clause dealt with collegiality between professionals 
 
                     and management issues. We have separated this into two Principles 
 
                     one dealing with collegiality and the other addressing management 
 
                     issues</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 6: COLLEAGUES. </p>
 
                   <p>Software engineers shall treat all those with whom they work 
 
                     fairly (11) and take positive steps to support these colleagial 
 
                     activities. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
 
                   <p> 6.01. Assist (12) colleagues in professional development.</p>
 
                   <p> 6.02. Review the work of other (13) software engineers which 
 
                     is not in the public domain only with their knowledge. </p>
 
                   <p>6.03. Credit fully the work of others. </p>
 
                   <p>6.04. (14) Review the work of others in an objective, candid, 
 
                     and properly-documented way. </p>
 
                   <p>6.05. Give a fair hearing to the opinion, concern, or complaint 
 
                     of a colleague. </p>
 
                   <p>(15) 6.07 assist colleagues in being fully aware of current 
 
                     standard work practices including policies and procedures 
 
                     for protecting passwords, files, security measures in general, 
 
                     and other confidential information. </p>
 
                   <p>(16) 6.08 not interfere in the professional career progression 
 
                     of any colleague </p>
 
                   <p>6.09 not(16a) take steps to supplant another software engineer 
 
                     after steps have been taken for employment. </p>
 
                   <p>6.10 call upon other professional's opinions, in their areas 
 
                     of competence, in situations outside of their own areas of 
 
                     competence.</p>
 
                   <p>============= N ===================== </p>
 
                   <p>This was separated out from Principle 6 as a means of gathering 
 
                     together specific anagement issues. The reason it has no number 
 
                     is that we have not figured out were it belongs. Suggestions 
 
                     ??????</p>
 
                   <p>(17) 
 
                     Principle N MANAGEMENT. A software engineers in a management 
 
                     or 
 
                     leadership capacity... 
 
                     (This sentence is under construction. Any suggestions ??????)</p>
 
                   <p>( Clauses are also under construction. Clauses to be formulated 
 
                     should include: enable, encourage, follow good practice..provide 
 
                     direction to good sowftware engineering practices and follow 
 
                     such practices ??? Suggestions??? - the principle contains 
 
                     due process now - need to add Team building, Communications, 
 
                     Good practices. Some clauses were moved from Principle 6 to 
 
                     here and modified to fit management. N6.06. Assure that employees 
 
                     are informed of standards before being held to them. N6.07. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Assure (18)employees know the employer's policies and procedures

                   <p>Develop a fair agreement concerning ownership of any software 
 
                     artifact an employee makes. (moved 6.11 to 6.09) N6.12. Attract 
 
                     employees only by full and accurate description of the conditions 
 
                     of employment. N6.13. Offer only fair and just (20) remuneration. 
 
                     N6.14. Not (21) unjustly prevent a subordinate from taking 
 
                     a better job for which the subordinate is qualified(22) or 
 
                     experienced to do. (23) N6.15 Not ask an employee to do anything 
 
                     inconsistent with this code.</p>
 
                   <p>============== 7 ================</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 7: SELF. Software engineers shall, throughout their 
 
                     career, try to 
 
                     enhance their own ability to practice their profession as 
 
                     it should be practiced. 
 
                     In particular, software engineers shall continually endeavor 
 
                     to:</p>
 
                   <p> 7.01. (24) Further their knowledge of (25) developments 
 
                     in the design, development, and testing of software and related 
 
                     documents,(26) together with the management of the development 
 
                     process.</p>
 
                   <p> 7.02. Improve their ability to create safe, reliable, and 
 
                     useful (27)quality software at reasonable cost and within 
 
                     a reasonable time. </p>
 
                   <p>7.03. Improve their ability to write accurate, informative, 
 
                     and literate documents in support of software on which they 
 
                     work.</p>
 
                   <p> 7.04. Improve their understanding of the software and related 
 
                     documents on which they work and of the environment in which 
 
                     they will be used. </p>
 
                   <p>7.05. Improve their knowledge of the law governing the software 
 
                     and related documents on which they work.</p>
 
                   <p> 7.06. Improve their knowledge of this code, its interpretation, 
 
                     and its application to their work.</p>

                     a professional software engineer. </p>
 
                   <p>================================================= Modification 
 
                     made to Principles 5-7</p>
 
                   <p>1 added &quot;as is consistent with public health, safety, 
 
                     and welfare.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p>2 added &quot;and other organizations&quot; to broaden the 
 
                     scope of this to entities an SE is likely to work with and 
 
                     for.</p>
 
                   <p>3 added &quot;the software engineer's commitment to this 
 
                     code of ethics&quot; to be sure that management knows of the 
 
                     constraints the code imposes on the SE's behaviour</p>
 
                   <p>4 added &quot;those who similarly &quot; to extend the support 
 
                     to those non- software engineers who my advocate elements 
 
                     of this code .</p>
 
                   <p>5 replace &quot;salary&quot; with &quot;remuneration&quot;. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>6. add &quot;or experience&quot;</p>
 
                   <p>7. replace with &quot;Exercise professional responsibility 
 
                     to society by serving in civic affairs constructively.&quot; 
 
                     to make clear the professional's obligations to benefit society.</p>
 
                   <p>8 replace &quot;Improve&quot; with &quot;Promote&quot; which 
 
                     unlike 'improve' doesn't presume a pre-existing knowledge
