       <p> SOFTWARE ENGINEERING: ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS OF PRACTICE</p>
       <p> JOINT IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY / ACM PROJECT WORKING GROUPS FORMING</p>
       <p> 15 October 1994</p>
       <p>Dear Computing Professional,</p>
       <p>The IEEE Computer Society and the ACM, the world's two largest organizations
         of computing professionals, with a combined membership of more than one
         hundred and seventy?five thousand members (worldwide) have established
         a Joint Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering
         as a Profession. This steering committee has established three tasks
         forces to accomplish their mission. One task force is identifying the
         body of knowledge and recommended practices, and another task force is
         addressing educational issues. Our task force on Software Engineering
         Ethics and Professional Practices (SEEPP) is tasked with documenting
         and codifying standards of ethical and professional practices for Software
         Engineers. We invite your participation in this task. You do NOT need
         to be a member of either society in order to participate.</p>
       <blockquote>
         <p>1.0 SCOPE These standards shall document generally accepted principles
           for identifying and resolving ethical conflicts relevant to the discipline
           of software engineering.</p>
         <p>Consideration shall be given to the responsibilities and obligations
           of the Software Engineer to peers and laypersons, employer, customer(s),
           the profession and society/humanity. Additionally, consideration shall
           be similarly given to the obligations and responsibilities of these
           various entities towards the Software Engineer.</p>
         <p>1.1 GLOBAL APPLICATION The SEEPP task force recognizes that the design,
           development and application of software often transcend national boundaries.
           We feel that it is vitally important that the global computing community
           have the means to insure that this project produces a product which
           is as reflective of the global computing community's wisdom as can
           be reasonably achieved. The participation of individuals from throughout
           the world is important to achieving this goal.</p>
         <p>These standards are intended to document the consensus of the global
           software engineering community. From time to time, consensus on an
           issue may not be clearly recognized. Accordingly, these standards shall
           also document various recommended practices and guidelines when no
           clear consensus can be established.</p>
         <p>2.0 PURPOSE The purpose of the SEEPP task force is to document the
           international consensus for minimally acceptable ethical/professional
           responsibilities and obligations of Software Engineers.</p>
         <p> 3.0 ORGANIZATION Working groups are being formed to address specific
           areas of concern. Eight different subject areas are distinguished so
           far, as described below. Should additional subject areas be identified,
           additional working groups may be established.</p>

           working groups as they desire.</p>
         <p>3.1.2 ORGANIZATIONAL/INSTITUTIONAL PARTICIPATION If organizations
           desire to send an organizational representative, they shall be accommodated.
           Their inputs will be valued and processed as would any other input.
           However, no organization shall be permitted a veto power over results
           that reflect the consensus of the concerned professionals in the field.</p>
         <p> 3.1.3 WORKING GROUP MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION PLEASE COMPLETE THE APPLICATION
           AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT AND EMAIL IT TO SEEPP.CFP@COMPUTER.ORG,
           BEFORE 5 NOVEMBER1994. ************************ </p>
         <p>We are organizing the working groups on 12 November 1994.</p>
         <p>3.1.4 EXPENSES Participation is voluntary. Each individual is responsible
           for all expenses incurred to support his/her participation. Many institutions
           provide financial support for their volunteers.</p>
         <p> 3.2 &quot;OFFICIAL&quot; IEEE STANDARD Working groups will operate
           according to the procedures specified for IEEE Standards (see Governance,
           below). However, working groups will NOT be initially chartered by
           the IEEE Computer Society's Standards Activities Board. (If the working
           groups were so chartered, individuals in several countries would be
           required to receive their government's approval for participation.)</p>
         <p> 3.3 GOVERNANCE The conduct of each working group shall follow the
           same written procedures that govern internationally recognized IEEE
           Standards Activities. These procedures specify that prompt consideration
           should be given to the written views and objections of all participants.
           Objectors should be notified of the disposition of an objection and
           the reasons therefor. Unresolved objections and the associated reasons
           should be reported to the entire working group's membership. The conclusions
           of the group should be supported by a consensus of the membership.
           (This would imply a ballot on the final products, probably run as IEEE
           Draft Standards ballots are currently run.)</p>
         <p>3.4 EMAIL &amp; MEETINGS Working group business is expected to be
           primarily conducted via e?mail and computer mediated conferencing.
           From time to time, a working group may also conduct face to face or
           teleconference meetings. These meetings should be conducted in a manner
           which facilitates attendance by as many members as possible.</p>
         <p>4.0 INTERNET ACCESS Each working group member should have a valid
           Internet email account. The member should also be prepared to obtain
           access to other Internet applications such as FTP, TELNET, Gopher,
           WAIS WWW/MOSAIC, etc.</p>
         <p>5.0 COMPLETION Working groups shall deliver their product to the SEEPP
           task force before November 1995.</p>
         <p> 6.0 THANK YOU! We hope that we have piqued your interest and that
           you will join us in this endeavor!</p>
