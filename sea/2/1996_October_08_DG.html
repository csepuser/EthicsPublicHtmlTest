                   <p>Dear professional competence working group member,</p>
 
                   <p> Below is a draft of a code of ethics developed by a sub 
 
                     group led by Ed Mechler of the professional competence working 
 
                     group.<br>We are soliciting comments from you on the code. We 
 
                     are especially interested in distinguishing between those 
 
                     imperatives which are aspirational and those which can be 
 
                     embodied in a code of practice .</p>
 
                   <p> It would be helpful if your suggestions were accompanied 
 
                     by suggested rewording rather than just sending a general 
 
                     sugggestions. Please apply your special expertises to this. 
 
                     <br>
 
                     A copy of this draft has been seen by the steering and it 
 
                     was suggested by one of their members that they review it 
 
                     in NOVEMBER !!, so your brilliant and rapid responses are 
 
                     encouraged. <br>
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Thanks for your help and continued interest.</p>

                   <p>CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS v1.0 September 1996 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>INTRODUCTION <br>
 
                     Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, 
 
                     industry, government, medicine, entertainment, and ordinary 
 
                     life. Because the utility of computers depends in large part 
 
                     on the instructions written for them, those who design, develop, 
 
                     and test software have enormous opportunities both to do good 
 
                     and to cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, that this 
 
                     power will be used for good, software engineers commit themselves 
 
                     to making the design, development, and testing of software 
 
                     a distinct, beneficial, and respected profession.</p>
 
                   <p> In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall 
 
                     adhere to the following standards of conduct. The seven main 
 
                     paragraphs state general rules. Each subsidiary clause is 
 
                     a specific application of its general rule, one experience 
 
                     has shown needs express statement; but no set of subsidiary 
 
                     clauses exhausts the general rule. </p>
 
                   <p>Rule 1: PRODUCT. </p>
 
                   <p>Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, 
 
                     assure that the software on which they work is useful to public, 
 
                     employer, customer, and user, completed on time and at reasonable 
 
                     cost, and free of significant error. In particular, software 
 
                     engineers shall, as appropriate:

                       on which they work respect the privacy of 
 
                       those who will be subject to the software. 
 
                     </p>
 
                     <p>1.11 Assure that raw information used in software 
 
                       is accurate, derives from a legitimate source,

                     </p>
 
                     <p>1.12. Assure ethical, economic, cultural, legal,

                       cost to employer, customer, user, and public.
