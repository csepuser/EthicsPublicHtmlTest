       <p align="center"><strong>Joint IEEE Computer Society and ACM Steering
           Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering as a Profession</strong> </p>
       <p align="justify"> Computing has been slow to respond to the increasing
         impacts of computing products on society. The effect of these products
         now influences more aspects of our society and the areas of influence
         are more critical than they had been Computers no longer merely calculate
         the speed of vehicles, but they control the speed and breaking ability
         of automobiles. </p>
       <p align="justify">Computing practitioners are more aware of these changes
         in area and criticality of their work products and have started to respond
         to this change in an organized way. Two major computing societies have
         joined forces in an effort to respond to these changes. Described here
         is the joint effort of the IEEE-Computer Society (IEEE-CS) and the Association
         for Computing Machinery(ACM) to professionalize software engineering.</p>
       <p align="justify"> Professionalization is conceived of as an appropriate
         response to the changing impact of computer technology and the effect
         of the behavior of computer technologists on our society, The marks of
         a profession which these societies carry to computing are: high standards
         of knowledge or skill in specific areas attested to by the attainment
         of a specific degree and an apprenticeship applying these skill, a commitment
         to keep these skills up to date, and a commitment to apply these skills
         for the benefit both the client and society. This commitment is generally
         described in standards of practice or codes of ethics. </p>
       <p align="justify">A series of events in 1993 brought focus to this activity
         of professionalization. In the Spring of 1993, Fletcher Buckley, a member
         of the Board of Governors (BoG) of the IEEE-CS, circulated a proposal
         for registering software professionals similar to the way engineers are
         registered in the United States. In May of 1993, the BoG approved a motion
         to establish a steering committee for evaluating, planning, and coordinating
         actions related to establishing software engineering as a profession.
         Later in 1993, the ACM Council endorsed the establishment of a Commission
         on Software Engineering to address a number of questions related to </p>
       <p align="justify">1) the terminology used to describe software engineering
         and those who work in the software area; </p>
       <p align="justify">2) identify generally accepted and desired standards
         of good software practice; and </p>
       <p align="justify">3) determine our ability to identify, educate, and train
         individuals who are competent with software engineering and design. Later
         in the Fall of 1993 an ad-hoc committee of the IEEE-CS with participation
         of the ACM worked to define a process and some initial recommendations
         to accomplish these tasks. Finally, in January 1994, the president of
         the IEEE-CS made a proposal to the ACM to form a Joint Steering Committee
         to accomplish these goals. </p>
       <p align="justify">The Joint Committee's mission statement is : &quot;To
         establish the appropriate set(s) of standards for professional practice
         of software engineering upon which industrial decisions, professional
         certification, and educational curricula can be based.&quot; To accomplish
         these tasks they made the following recommendations: </p>
       <p align="justify">1) adopt standard definitions; </p>
       <p align="justify">2) define required body of knowledge and recommended
         practices, </p>
       <p align="justify">3) Define Ethical standards, </p>
       <p align="justify">4) define educational curricula for undergraduate, graduate
         (MS) and continuing education (for retraining and migration.) The committee
         believes there is an implied dependency between these tasks, and that
         the recommendations be implemented in the suggested order. </p>
       <p align="justify">The steering committee decided to accomplish these tasks
         through the establishment of a series of task forces. Initially the task
         forces established were: software engineering body of knowledge and recommended
         practices; software engineering ethics and professional practices, and
         software engineering curriculum. </p>
       <p align="justify">Each task force is co-chaired by an IEEE-CS and an ACM
         representative. The body of knowledge task force is chaired by Patricia
         Douglas and Tony Cocchi. The required body of knowledge and recommended
         practices are not static because technology evolves and the professional
         should keep up with the field. There is interest in approaching the development
         and maintenance of the set of recommended practices like a technical
         standard: adopted by consensus and subject to periodic revision. The
         initial version of the body of knowledge will be developed by a survey
         of practitioners. Early versions will be widely distributed and after
         modification will be distributed for comment electronically. The ethics
         and professional practices task force is co-chaired by Donald Gotterbarn
         and Robert Melford. This task force has defined its purpose as &quot; to
         document an international consensus for minimally acceptable ethical/professional
         responsibilities and obligations of software engineers.&quot; The standards
         to be established shall document generally accepted principles for identifying
         and resolving ethical conflicts relevant to the discipline of software
         engineering. Considerations shall be given to the responsibilities and
         obligations of the Software Engineer to peers and lay persons, employer,
         customer(s), the profession, and society/humanity. The standards are
         intended to document the consensus of the global software engineering
         community. From time to time, consensus on an issue may not be clearly
         recognized. Accordingly, these standards shall also document various
         recommended practices and guidelines when no clear consensus can be established.</p>
       <p align="justify"> The SEEPP task force has tentatively identified a number
         of areas to develop recommendations and has established working groups
         to specifically address these areas. The first areas identified are:
         intellectual property, professional competence, professional relationships,
         privacy, reliability and safety, security, and social justice. Issues
         for the intellectual property working group include: ownership of: code,
         algorithms, systems design and specifications, project control methods,
         test methods, quality improvement models, etc. Issues for the professional
         competence working group include specifying truth about ones skills,
         obligations to keep skills current, knowing and communicating truth about
         code, moral standards about what should be produced? (concern for end-use
         consequences), keeping staff current, appropriate knowledge base, non-generalization
         of expertise, educational issues: certification, registration, and licensure. </p>
       <p align="justify">The issues for the Professional Relationships working
         group include managing communications and ethical obligations from :
         the professional to professional and the professional to lay person or
         society, the professional to employer, professional to customer, and
         the professional to electronic community. It also deals with support
         for &quot;whistle blowers,&quot; and obligations to foster responsible
         behavior amongst non-professionals. Issues of concern for the privacy
         working group include: monitoring (workplace, everyplace), confidentiality,
         data aggregation, falsification or communication of a &quot;digital persona&quot; out
         of context, misuse of data, relationship of electronic privacy to other
         policy issues, e.g., computerized medical records and health care reform,
         etc. The reliability and safety working group is concerned with issues
         including: contracts, reliability thresholds in contracts, testing, risks,
         user centered design, truth in advertising, informed consent for buyers,
         financial support for improved quality, and quantifying quality. The
         Security working group is concerned with data integrity, statutory violations,
         encryption, malicious programming (viruses, etc.), system administrator's
         responsibility, and encryption. The Social Justice working group is concerned
         with the professional's responsibility to end use, equity of access,
         allocation of resources, computing for the disabled, and the impact of &quot;de-skilling&quot; (computer
         takes over a person's job). The curriculum task force is co-chaired by
         Doris Carver and John Werth. This task force will use the input from
         the body of knowledge survey to develop curricula for software engineering
         education and training. This task force is equally concerned with the
         education of people entering software engineering and with the continuing
         education of software engineers. </p>
       <p align="justify">To help accomplish this task, the task force will distinguish
         the knowledge and skills of a novice software engineer from those of
         an experienced software engineer. In this effort, the IEEE-CS /ACM steering
         committee is exchanging ideas with other international organizations,
         such as the IEE and the BCS in the development of these standards. </p>
