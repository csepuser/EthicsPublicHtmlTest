                   I made a grevious error yesterday: the gentleman and scholar
 
                   (I'm groveling here) whose work I found so helpful is Thomas
 
                   Hilton. (I spelled it wrong in my message yesterday.) Meanwhile,

                   <br>
                   INTRODUCTION<br>
 
                   <br>
                   All professionals have responsibilities and privileges due
                   to
 
                   their role. Computer professionals are trusted to make technical
 
                   decisions about software and hardware. These decisions require
 
                   sensitivity to human values<br>
                   as well as technical expertise.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   The interaction of human values and technical decisions is
                   particularly
 
                   important in the area of software quality. The question of &quot;how 
 
                   good is good enough&quot; requires values clarification, allocation
 
                   of resources,<br>
                   prediction of costs, and analyses and predictions that cannot
 
                   be based on certainty, but should be based on measurement.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   Most software is so complex that guaranteeing perfection in
 
                   PRODUCT quality, while highly desirable, is infeasible. However,
 
                   guaranteeing aherence to mutually agreed-upon development PROCESSES
 
                   from which product quality can be expected to flow is feasible.
 
                   In the suggestions below we insist that both<br>
                   product and process be addressed when dealing with professional
 
                   responsibilities for software quality.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   We propose that computer professionals adopt an ethical standard
 
                   of &quot;informed consent,&quot; as outlined below.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   GUIDING PRINCIPLE<br>
 
                   <br>
                   A software developer should obtain informed consent from the
 
                   client. A software user should have available information about
 
                   the safety and reliability of software. The public should be
 
                   able to obtain detailed<br>
                   information about the testing and reliability measures of any
 
                   commercial software.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   DEFINITIONS<br>
 
                   <br>
 &quot;software&quot; : computer programs, internal documentation, 
 
                   design documents, test plans, user manuals, online help, and 
 
                   the like &quot;software developer&quot; : any professional
                   involved
 
                   in the production of computer software; this includes but is
 
                   not limited to designers, coders, testers, managers, and salespeople<br>
 
                   <br>
 &quot;client&quot; : the person or entity that pays for the 
 
                   software<br>
 
                   <br>
 &quot;user&quot; : any human who interacts with the software<br>
 
                   <br>
 &quot;public&quot; : any citizen or organization<br>
 
                   <br>
 &quot;informed consent&quot;: see below<br>
 
                   <br>
                   INFORMED CONSENT<br>
 
                   <br>
 &quot;Informed consent&quot; is a term used in medical ethics. 
 
                   We borrow this term and define it for computer professionals
 
                   as follows:<br>
 
                   <br>
                   The client of a computer professional who is buying software
 
                   should be given sufficient information to make a reasonable
 
                   choice about investing in the software. The developer should
 
                   disclose information at an appropriate level of detail. The
 
                   acceptance of the client should be voluntary, and should include
 
                   a formal authorization whenever possible. <br>
                   Words such as &quot;sufficient,&quot; &quot;reasonable,&quot; 
 
                   and &quot;appropriate&quot; can only be defined specific to
 
                   a particular situation. Part of a professional's responsibility
 
                   in informed consent is to make these definitions in a good<br>
                   faith for each particular exchange with a client.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   Sometimes the people who buy software are remote from the developer;
 
                   for example, shrink wrapped software clients. In this case &quot;informed 
 
                   consent&quot; will not be formalized in the same way that it
 
                   can be when custom software is developed for an individual
                   client.
 
                   However, informed consent can be approximated in this cases
 
                   by a good faith effort to make disclosure information available
 
                   to a customer before purchase.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   Except for those cases where the client cannot be negotiated
 
                   with directly (such as shrink-wrapped software), we assume
                   below
 
                   that the client or a representative of the client is available.
 
                   When the client is not available<br>
                   for direct consultation, the quantifiable information required
 
                   for informed consent should be available to customers shopping
 
                   for software.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   IMPLEMENTATION OF INFORMED CONSENT<br>
 
                   <br>
                   The developer should create as part of a contract or as a separate
 
                   document an informed consent form. This document discloses
                   the
 
                   information presented by the developer about software quality,
 
                   and the client's willingness to accept the software knowing
 
                   the measurements and limitations included in that document.
 
                   Informed consent is complete when both the developer and the
 
                   client sign the document.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   CONTENTS OF AN INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT<br>
 
                   <br>
                   I. Product Measurements:<br>
 
                   <br>
                   This section includes any and all software quality measures
 
                   agreed to by the developer and the client. These could include
 
                   mean-time-to-failure under a certain distribution of inputs;
 
                   software metrics, either as an average or within an acceptable
 
                   range over all modules; safety conditions that are never violated
 
                   after a certain number of random tests; or any other repeatable,
 
                   verifiable measures. When presenting the informed consent document
 
                   for signing, the developer demonstrates that the software meets
 
                   or exceeds the agreed upon measures. Measures must be defined
 
                   in such detail (such as margins for error, significant digits,
 
                   rounding protocols) as to be unambiguous. Each measurement
                   should
 
                   be defined in a single reference document that includes this
 
                   type of detail.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   II. Process Description:<br>
 
                   <br>
                   This section describes the processes used to develop the software
 
                   and to verify its software quality. The developer describes
 
                   how adherence to the process guidelines is verified. Each process
 
                   must be described in a single defining reference document.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   III. Assessment Implementation:<br>
 
                   <br>
                   This section details who assesses compliance with the product
 
                   measurements and the process requirements. This section may
 
                   include details about who is responsible for what in the assessment
 
                   phase; for example, either the client or the developer may
                   be
 
                   responsible for the generation of test cases.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   CONTRACT RAMIFICATIONS<br>
 
                   <br>
                   Informed consent should be a binary transaction: either the
 
                   two parties mutually accept it, or they do not. Mutual acceptance
 
                   of an informed consent document is part of the final phase
                   of
 
                   a software project. The development of the document should
                   begin
 
                   in the earliest phases of development, but it cannot be signed
 
                   until all the described measurements and assessments have been
 
                   completed. A contract can make reference to the time when this
 
                   document is signed to determine bonuses or penalties, but the
 
                   document itself should focus on software quality, not schedule
 
                   or payment. The issues of time and money are a vital part of
 
                   the negotiations between client and developer on what level
 
                   of quality are acceptable; however, informed<br>
                   consent, once agreed to, becomes a required step in acceptance.
 
                   Renegotiating informed consent is possible, but not encouraged.<br>

                   INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENTS AS PUBLIC ARCHIVES<br>
 
                   <br>
                   The informed consent document is made available by the developer
 
                   in paper form (at minimal cost) and electronically (without
 
                   cost) to the public. User documentation gives information about
 
                   how to access the document. The IEEE Computer Society maintains
 
                   a directory to all such electronic documents for publicly available
 
                   software.<br>
 
                   <br>
 
                   <br>
 
                   <br>
                   WHY I THINK THIS MIGHT WORK<br>
 
                   <br>
                   The description above does not require any particular style
 
                   of testing or verification. I do research in testing and reliability
 
                   techniques, and I cannot imagine that the research community
 
                   or the business community will<br>
                   ever reach consensus about which techniques should be required.
 
                   The informed consent form does require mutually agreed to measurements
 
                   of some kind. This seems like a minimum level of professionalism.<br>
 
                   <br>
                   By not including contractual details in the document, parties
 
                   to the consent should be willing to make the document public.
 
                   A collection of documents could be a rich source of information
 
                   for researchers in software quality, and public display of
                   these
 
                   documents would encourage more responsibility from developers
 
                   and clients. <br>
                   We have to do SOMETHING to encourage professionalism in software
 
                   development. Perhaps an informed consent emphasis will help. </p>
