      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" --> I have done some work on
       some of these issues, as part of the effort by the Australian Computer
       Society's Software Engineering Research Consultative Council (ACS SERCC).
       This group reports to the ACS Computer Systems and Software Engineering
       Board, of which I am the Director..
       <p>I also gave a long talk to the Asian Pacific Software Engineering Conference
         on this, and I will complete the presentation before I get to Austin..</p>
       <p>I guess I am concerned with the issue of the &quot;engineering&quot; nature
         of our proposed training programs.. I am also concerned about the lack
         of intersection between the SE research community and the conventional
         software industry.. the research agenda's are still largely driven by
         defense/aerospace and large scale telecomms issue.. plus embedded systems..
         we see little input from the large commercial,in house developers in
         what we used to call EDP, nor from the large, package producers..</p>
       <p>t is important for us to clarify our understanding of what engineering
         really is,and how it got to where it is..</p>
       <p></p>
       <p></p>
       <p>Plus, (and this is more provocative), I do not believe we really understand
         how software is actually developed..</p>
       <p>Having said this, there is now a well-established BOK, and we can see
         some significant benefits from it. Plus we do have a general understanding
         of the broad issue of engineering.. (the problem I refer to is that of
         what precisely is the relationship between SW development and engineering
         , and how can we move down that path more rapidly )</p>
       <p> <br>
   I am looking forward to this exercise, and to meeting you all in Austin..</p>

   ..*&gt; Dennis Frailey writing to selected members of the ..*&gt; SWEBOK project,
   IAB, SWECC, and various related efforts.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; This is a white paper outlining my thoughts on an issue ..*&gt; that
         is of considerable importance to the software engineering ..*&gt; projects
         being sponsored by SWECC: Body of Knowledge ..*&gt; (SWEBOK), education,
         ethics and professional practices, ..*&gt; and (to be established) performance
         norms. I also propose ..*&gt; some possible solutions. I invite comment
         and ..*&gt; critique from all affected parties. I intend to propose ..*&gt; implementing
         something along these lines at the SWECC ..*&gt; meeting in Austin on
         January 28 29, .. * &gt; so timely response is of the essence.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; The issue:</p>
       <p>..*&gt; It has become clear in recent communcation that there is somewhat
         ..*&gt; of a disconnect over defining certain parts of the body of ..*&gt; knowledge
         for software engineering. Specifically, although the ..*&gt; BOK project
         has clear plans for identifying and documenting those ..*&gt; knowledge
         areas that are unique to software engineering, it is not ..*&gt; clear
         how we will identify what knowledge areas within computer ..*&gt; science
         and other disciplines are part of what a software engineer ..*&gt; must
         know. These form the foundation upon which a software ..*&gt; engineer
         must be educated, just as a solid &quot;pre med&quot; program ...*&gt; is
         the foundation on which medical doctors are educated.</p>
       <p> <br>
   ..*&gt; While those who define the body of knowledge for a medical ..*&gt; doctor
   do not define chemistry, they certainly identify what ..*&gt; parts of chemistry
   a medical doctor must know.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; Upon reflection, it seems to me that this problem is a direct
         result ..*&gt; of the relative autonomy of the various projects. I would
         like to ..*&gt; see that change and, since SWECC's role is to coordinate,
         I am ..*&gt; proposing a way that we could coordinate a closer form of
         work ..*&gt; among the projects.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; The goal:</p>
       <p>..*&gt; It is clear that we must eventually define all that a software
         engineer ..*&gt; should know in order to properly define curricula, establish
         ..*&gt; accreditation criteria, and prepare licensing examinations. It
         is also ..*&gt; clear that all of our projects have both interest and
         expertise to ..*&gt; contribute to this. Therefore I would like to offer
         some ideas that might ..*&gt; lead to a strategy for accomplishing what
         we all hope will be accomplished.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; The approach:</p>
       <p>..*&gt; My suggestions involve two elements: an agreement regarding
         division of ..*&gt; responsibility and an agreement for cooperative activity
         among the various ..*&gt; projects. Speaking from the SWECC perspective,
         I propose ..*&gt; that SWECC coordinate and facilitate these cooperative
         activities ..*&gt; once the projects agree on what they would be.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; As an example of a cooperative activity, the education project
         has ..*&gt; recently discussed a possible workshop ..*&gt; that would
         deal with certain issues about what must be in the ..*&gt; core curriculum
         of a software engineer. I believe this is an excellent ..*&gt; example
         of an activity that could be cooperative among the projects, ..*&gt; because
         it would address key issues that affect all of them.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; Division of Responsibility</p>
       <p>..*&gt; I propose that the BOK project accept full responsibility for
         the following: ..*&gt; identifying the knowledge areas that are unique
         to software engineers and</p>
       <p> <br>
   ..*&gt; identifying, within each knowledge area, identifying and providing
   reference ..*&gt; material to definitive sources on the topics that are essential
   to ..*&gt; a software engineer. They have already produced a baseline set of
   such ..*&gt; knowledge areas and I believe this part of their activity is well
   underway ..*&gt; identifying other disciplines that contain knowledge areas
   that are important ..*&gt; for a software engineer. This too has already been
   done in a baseline ..*&gt; manner.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; I propose that the BOK project and the Education project accept
         joint<br>
   ..*&gt; responsibility (and include tasks in both of their plans) for:<br>
   ..*&gt; identifying those knowledge areas within other disciplines (computer<br>
   ..*&gt; science, computer engineering, math, science, etc) that are<br>
   ..*&gt; necessary for a software engineers. Examples might include<br>
   ..*&gt; data structures from computer science or computer architecture<br>
   ..*&gt; from computer engineering or discrete mathematics</p>
       <p>..*&gt; I propose that the Education project accept full responsibility
         for<br>
   ..*&gt; identifying and providing authoritative references for the<br>
   ..*&gt; topics within each knowledge area from &quot;other&quot; disciplines<br>
   ..*&gt; that are necessary for software engineers. I believe this<br>
   ..*&gt; has already been started, and as a SWECC member I would<br>
   ..*&gt; endorse further work in this area</p>
       <p>..*&gt; I propose that the (not yet formed) performance norms project
         ..*&gt; work jointly with the Code of Ethics and Professional Practices
         ..*&gt; project to identify the tasks that a software engineer would
         be ..*&gt; expected to perform. Perhaps the other two projects should
         also ..*&gt; be involved in this. This would be based on the knowledge
         ..*&gt; areas defined by the other two projects and would probably ..*&gt; not
         commence for about a year. At that time, the two projects ..*&gt; should
         further define how this can be subdivided, but it seems to ..*&gt; me
         that the Code of Ethics and Professional Practices project ..*&gt; would
         concentrate on defining the professional practices that ..*&gt; would
         be considered essential for a software engineer and the ..*&gt; performance
         norms project would focus on the skills and the ..*&gt; performance standards
         associated with these.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; Cooperative activity:</p>
       <p>..*&gt; Each project would have an (at least) annual review of its progress,<br>
   ..*&gt; to which each other project and SWECC should be invited to send<br>
   ..*&gt; representatives. This review might occur during a SWECC meeting</p>
       <p> <br>
   ..*&gt; or might occur separately, depending on the magnitude of the project
   ..*&gt; and the amount of work to be reported on. ..*&gt; SWECC can attempt
   to schedule its meetings to adjoin major project ..*&gt; reviews so as to minimize
   travel for all concerned. Since SWECC must ..*&gt; report to its sponsoring
   societies (ACM and IEEE CS) on an annual ..*&gt; basis, we can also coordinate
   the timing to fit their annual schedules.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; For all responsibilities that are joint, the affected projects
         should ..*&gt; plan and budget for appropriate joint activities and should
         keep ..*&gt; SWECC and the other projects informed of these.</p>
       <p>..*&gt; I invite comments and suggestions.</p>
