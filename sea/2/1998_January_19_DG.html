                   <p>Putting the Best Face on it--the real crisis. An eighteen-year-old 
 
                     with no computer training declares herself to be an experienced 
 
                     software engineer. Many large expensive software projects 
 
                     are never implemented or implemented in way that cause significant 
 
                     errors. This state of affairs has been characterized by the 
 
                     cosmetic phrase &quot;Software Crisis&quot;. This phrase is 
 
                     cosmetic in the same way as describing a programming mistake 
 
                     I am responsible for as a &quot;bug&quot; is cosmetic. Bugs 
 
                     just seem to crawl into software-I am not responsible. The 
 
                     &quot;software crisis&quot; is a state of affairs that just 
 
                     is. If we remove the cosmetics from the phase &quot;software 
 
                     crisis&quot; we reveal the truth which might better be described 
 
                     as the &quot;software engineering crisis&quot;. This crisis 
 
                     is best characterized by a satisfaction with a Capability 
 
                     Maturity Model level 1 approach to software development and 
 
                     the assertion that Software Engineering is still an immature 
 
                     discipline with no standards. Life is easy when there are 
 
                     no expectations and standards. Fortunately, software professionals 
 
                     are no longer willing to use this make-up. Software Engineering 
 
                     has a significant impact on society and ought to adopt professional 
 
                     standards.</p>
 
                   <p> The IEEE Computer Society and the ACM established a Joint 
 
                     Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering 
 
                     as a profession. One taska force they established, the task 
 
                     force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices 
 
                     (SEEPP), was to document the ethical and professional responsibilities 
 
                     and obligations of software engineers. The task Force membership 
 
                     was international, spanning 15 time zones, with representation 
 
                     from industry, the military, academe, and the legal profession/ 
 
                     The Task Force has developed a Code for a sub-specialization 
 
                     within the constituencies of both organizations and for the 
 
                     profession itself. But the Code is much more than that. The 
 
                     goal of the IEEE-CS/ACM Steering Committee was to Professionalize 
 
                     Software Engineering. Software engineering as a discipline 
 
                     has particular idiosyncratic needs, as described in the details 
 
                     of the Code. The success of this effort to articulate the 
 
                     professional responsibilities of software engineers has already 
 
                     been recognized. The Texas Board of Professional Engineer's 
 
                     Licensing Committee, in a recent meeting that addressed the 
 
                     subject of professional registration of software engineers, 
 
                     recognized software engineering as a new discipline with its 
 
                     own foundations and unique body of knowledge. They also expressed 
 
                     high regard for the Code of Ethics and Professional Practice. 
 
                     Specificity of practice is the key to the elaborated Code. 
 
                     The discussion by the Texas Board of Professional Engineer's 
 
                     Licensing Committee is but one example of significant discussions 
 
                     outside of the professional societies about the status of 
 
                     Software Engineering. The attempt to address concerns about 
 
                     the quality of software products and the talent of the software 
 
                     engineer on a local, regional, or national basis is a mistake. 
 
                     The professionalization of software engineering requires a 
 
                     Code that is international and that can be adopted by professional 
 
                     organizations, industry, and individual professionals. </p>
 
                   <p>The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional 
 
                     Practice straddles the ACM/IEEE-CS gulf, and differs enough 
 
                     from both the ACM and IEEE's more general codes to attract 
 
                     attention from non-organizational types (like industries). 
 
                     &gt;From the evidence, the Code seems to have accomplished 
 
                     both of these goals. The Code has received support from numerous 
 
                     countries including Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, 
 
                     Germany, India, Ireland, Netherlands, United Kingdom, United 
 
                     States, and Uruguay. Most items of the Code surveyed had better 
 
                     than 95% support. This indicates that the Code enjoys an international 
 
                     consensus. It also has received support from numerous industries, 
 
                     from large multinationals to small software development firms. 
 
                     The Software Engineering Crisis is in pact due to a failure 
 
                     to stand up for professional practices and accept responsibility 
 
                     for our work. The Code can function as an ethical charter 
 
                     for the profession. Such a Code can be used to aid in decision 
 
                     making and as a means to educate the public, managers, trainees 
 
                     and practicing professionals about professional standards 
 
                     and professional responsibility. The joint support of this 
 
                     development effort by the ACM and the IEEE-CS shows the public 
 
                     that different organizations within the same industry can 
 
                     cooperate, and makes it easier for professionals to understand 
 
                     what their obligations are. </p>
 
                   <p>The general acceptance of the Code also provides an explicit 
 
                     standard of good software practices against which current 
 
                     practices can be measured. The Code (www-cs.etsu.edu/seeri/secode.htm, 
 
                     www.computer.org/tab/seprof/code.htm, and www.acm.org/serving) 
 
                     has been forwarded to the leadership of the ACM and the IEEE-CS.
