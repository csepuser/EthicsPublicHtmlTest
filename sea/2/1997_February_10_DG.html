       <p>In Principle 1, you insist on the following. &quot;Software engineers 
         shall,insofar as possible, ... free of error.&quot; This is like saying 
         that a good man shall free his mind of angry thoughts... it is impossible. 
         We strive to reduce errors. I understand that &quot;insofar as possible&quot; 
         technically gives you an out, but I don't like this. It is misleading. 
         Cleanroom enthusiasts not withstanding, it just isn't a realistic goal. 
         I think the code should reflect that reality. Originally we had the word 
         'significant' in the clause and you objected to that so we took it out 
         hoping that &quot;insofar as possible&quot; would act as the qualifier 
       </p>
       <p>It does. If it is politically required, leave it. I still don't like 
         it, and you know why, but the politics are unknown to me, and I'd like 
         to keep it that way.</p>
       <p> In 1.07, the realistic estimates should include a realistic estimate 
         of the probability of failure. Unless you really believe you have guaranteed 
         &quot;error free.&quot; We had the word &quot;accurate&quot; and at your 
         suggestion changed it to &quot;realistic&quot; thinking that &quot;ralistic 
         estimates ...of outcome&quot; would take care of this worry In 1.11 and 
         1.12 you use the word &quot;Aspire.&quot; Obeying 1.11 is essential to 
         remain LEGAL. 1.12 is so broad as to be practically impossible, so it 
         is clearly an &quot;inspirational&quot; sentence, as opposed to 1.11 which 
         is more doable and more critical to staying out of court. Shouldn't these 
         have different verbs? Good point- we had softened it in response to a 
         steering committee criticism that you can never be certrain about the 
         quaklity and origin of the data. Any reaction to this... suggerstion to 
         rephrase it? </p>
       <p>For things we need to do to remain legal, we could say &quot;Be careful 
         that...&quot; For inspiritational statements &quot;aspire to...&quot;</p>
       <p>1.14 Are you going to include a citation to a handbook of &quot;standard&quot; 
         software engineering practices? I want that reference.We have struggled 
         with this one- it was the clause that says don't use fads, simply because 
         they are fads to develop a product. &quot;Avoid fads, departing from current 
         practices only when justified&quot; We received major attacks on &quot;fads&quot; 
         Perhaps answer your &quot;standards&quot; question in terms of &quot;what 
         is publicly defensible&quot; or in terms of results from the skills task 
         force. I know neither of these is a good answer, but they are answers 
         other technologies would use in defending that a practice was &quot;standard&quot; 
         Any ideas how to reframe this point??</p>
       <p>The software engineer should follow industry practice that, in his/her 
         judgement, are most appropriate for the task at hand. Novel and experimental 
         techniques may be appropriate, but not for the sake of novelty. </p>
       <p>You raised this question last time and we added phrases like &quot;is 
         consistent with&quot;. This was shot down. People said this is a &quot;standard&quot; 
         clause in engineering codes. This is in the public health safety and welfare 
         section. Their interpretation puts a lot of weight on the phrase &quot;ahead 
         of&quot;. Dont put loyalty to company profit ahead of oublic right to 
         safety etc. I like the language &quot;tempered and guided by&quot; much 
         more than the more absolutist language in the sentences cited above. Not 
         sure how to fit this phrase into the clause, any suggestions? &quot;Pirated&quot; 
         could be &quot;illegally obtained&quot; or &quot;used without proper authorization.&quot;&quot;turn 
         out badly&quot; could be &quot;problematic&quot; or &quot;deficient&quot; 
         or &quot;disappointing.&quot; 4.09 Whistleblowing does clarify a problem 
         with this sentence. Perhaps it should be rewritten something like this: 
         &quot;Unless ethical considerations demand otherwise, an employee should 
         represent noone else without the employer's explicit consent.&quot; GOOD- 
         In Principle 5, &quot;and is consistent&quot; should be &quot;as is consistent&quot; 
         or else something else. At the moment, the sentence doesn't parse correctly. 
         5.09. As above, my interests are important. I would not sacrifice my children 
         for the profession. The language overstates the case. How about &quot;promote 
         the interests of the profession.&quot; That seems vacuous, but honest. 
         We tried to address this concern in a broader way by change (1) where 
         we added &quot;and is consistent with public health....&quot; I don't 
         know the word &quot;outwith,&quot; and it is used more than once. Simon's 
         contribution- a scotish idiom, meaning &quot;standing outside of&quot;. 
         He thought it would add an international flavour to the code and determine 
         if anyone read this far. </p>
       <p>HA, HA... I passed the test! International flavor or international obscurity?</p>
       <p> I don't know what the following means in explanatory comment 4: &quot;WE 
         HAVE SOME A ON THE COMMITTEE.&quot; Is this an unfortunate remnant of 
         a rant? Joke pointed at one of the folks here which did not get deleted 
         from your version. Sory I'm off to Mexico after Monday. que pasa, Is uis 
         opening a branch campus and you have to commute? </p>
       <p>Just sunshine for my sun-starved wife.</p>
       <p>Thanks for your help. it is now noon here, I guess it is about 6 am your 
         time, so good morning and I look foreward to any further comments so I 
         can launch this draft to the task force. ps. will email make it to mexico- 
         we need one pass on the schedule and you never said if you found the organization 
         satisfactory. I don't want to send it any where else until I hear from 
         you on it. </p>
       <p>The schedule seems fine, Don. You know the politics, I don't. Unpaid 
         work for all of us, and it seems like lots of it (especially for you), 
         but do what you have to do, and tell me what to do when.</p>
