                     4.1.1 FY &#8217;98<br>
 
                     4.1.1.1 Financial Statement</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Treasurer Turner reported on the status of 
 
                     the current fiscal year which has been very positive. The 
 
                     bottom line is very healthy. Non-SIG items are currently positive 
 
                     and are projected to remain that way. The General Activities 
 
                     Net (MPO and VM combined) is projected at $200-250K and will 
 
                     be applied to the Deficit Retirement Fund at the end of FY&#8217;98. 
 
                     The FY&#8217;98 projection is the basis for the FY&#8217;99 
 
                     Budget.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Revenues for the Digital Library (DL) were 
 
                     $100K, and there is an expectation that this may reach $300K 
 
                     next year. Volunteer Management had several unusual expenditures: 
 
                     the higher cost of the China trip versus previous international 
 
                     meetings, the Executive Director Search expense, and the extra 
 
                     Council meeting. These do not present a problem, but relative 
 
                     to where we usually are at this time, it is not as positive. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">One of the modifications to Draft 2 was that 
 
                     the EC recommended adding $50K to the EC Contingency Fund 
 
                     for new programs, and business opportunities, e.g., Software 
 
                     Engineering Licensing Committee; 1999 Awards Program; the 
 
                     Virtual Community; International Projects; 2001 Conference. 
 
                     This $50K from the EC Contingency Fund has been offset by 
 
                     improved revenue projections from the DL of $50K, thereby 
 
                     maintaining a net zero balance.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Since the bylaws require a 30-day notice 
 
                     for budget approval, the choices are either to do nothing 
 
                     today and have a mail ballot at a later date, or suspend the 
 
                     bylaw and vote on the budget today.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">3. PRESENTATIONS/DISCUSSION/&amp; POSSIBLE 
 
                     ACTION ITEMS</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">3.11 Executive Director Search Committee 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Frances Allen reported for the Executive 
 
                     Director Search Committee and presented a summary status report 
 
                     on the search. Two Search firms were interviewed and Diversified 
 
                     was selected. Both firms had the same approaches overall, 
 
                     however, Diversified was willing to accept a significant amount 
 
                     of the Search Committee&#8217;s input and appeared easier 
 
                     to work with in general. There were approximately 100 applications 
 
                     from which Diversified selected profiles for the Search Committee 
 
                     to review, after which Diversified organized a list of the 
 
                     final interviewees. There was an announcement of availability 
 
                     of this position on the web as there was the last time. This 
 
                     is a very aggressive search and there are time constrictions 
 
                     so that the right person will be able to complete negotiations 
 
                     and have sufficient time to notify his/her present employer. 
 
                     The Search Committee will meet June 3 and will pool all developments. 
 
                     The short list of candidates should be available by August 
 
                     1. The Search Committee expects to hold interviews in late 
 
                     August/early September. The selection of the Executive Director 
 
                     should be made and proposed to Council by the fall meeting 
 
                     (late September/early October), and then it is expected to 
 
                     have the new ED on board by November 1. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The discussion focused on concerns arising 
 
                     from the last search, and the issue of the impression that 
 
                     the Executive Committee presented Council with a fait accompli. 
 
                     The consensus was that this time the search was a much more 
 
                     open process. The ACM President will be involved in the final 
 
                     round of interviews with the Search Committee; there will 
 
                     be 4 members of Search Committee and 2 members of EC present 
 
                     during these interviews. Part of the difficulties from the 
 
                     last search was that the EC had a very short time to get an 
 
                     impression of the candidates, whereas this time the Search 
 
                     Committee will have more time and thereby a greater comfort 
 
                     level is added to the process. Another major weakness last 
 
                     time was that the Search Committee did not have a consensus. 
 
                     It is important if only one candidate is being discussed to 
 
                     be very sure that he/she will accept, if approved by Council, 
 
                     since this is a very compressed time schedule. Draft 3 of 
 
                     the position description incorporates the responsibilities 
 
                     and requirements of the ED as follows:</p>

                     5.1 FY &#8217;99 Budget</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Executive Director DeBlasi presented the 
 
                     budget, which he noted would be the last time he would do 
 
                     so, and which has improved over the past several years. The 
 
                     budget zeroes out General/SIG areas, and as in past years 
 
                     that zeroing out is very conservative. Expenses have been 
 
                     kept very conservative, e.g., there are no additional people 
 
                     on staff than there were 9 years ago. There has been a great 
 
                     upturn on the DL, however, the complete numbers will not be 
 
                     known until the January renewal process; there is also an 
 
                     international impact with multiple sites for the DL. The Pubs 
 
                     Board and the MAB are working to make this a reality. This 
 
                     is one of our biggest business areas.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In the SIG area, the budget zeroes out which 
 
                     is consistent with what the SIGs submitted to us. Conferences 
 
                     net $4 million per year. There will be $23 million in bank 
 
                     at the end of next year. ACM is not a bank and this money 
 
                     should be spent to build programs. A 5-year plan is necessary 
 
                     with a strong direction in program spending. Integrated plans 
 
                     for program spending should be developed which would increase 
 
                     the value of ACM membership. It is important for Council to 
 
                     direct this effort of program spending with a greater involvement 
 
                     from the SIG area. </p>

                     people&#8217;s desire to subscribe within the next 2-3 years. 
 
                     Doing away with print is overestimated, most people will probably 
 
                     hold on to at least one print publication. The DL will not 
 
                     affect membership since members have other concerns than just 
 
                     this one. Although some DL subscribers have let go of SIGs, 
 
                     and others, MVP, these numbers are in the same ballpark as 
 
                     before the DL. There are only 4 months of trends so far, however, 
 
                     SIGs who have a significant part of this in their budgets 
 
                     should pay attention to these trends. </p>

                     a special emphasis on the DL, and highlight key information

                     to university and other networks in the various countries,

                     effective trip, and a door was opened which can do wonders 
 
                     in the spirit of cooperation/involvement. The Local SIGs wanted 
 
                     very much for us to be able to participate in their conferences. 
 
                     It was extremely helpful that Kam Fai Wong was with us; having 
 
                     an inside person in these regions has been crucial in establishing

                     Membership has been declining, but a membership program is 
 
                     being developed to address service to members. The last conference 
 
                     was approximately a $12 million conference. There were 42K 
 
                     attendees, which is on the low side. However, of this number 
 
                     a significant amount paid the full-freight conference fees. 
 
                     In addition, the large trade show pays for approximately one-half 
 
                     of the conference. Approximately 725 volunteers worked on 
 
                     the conference. There were 600 online submissions for the 
 
                     electronic theatre. Total press coverage reached 2.2 million 
 
                     people. SIGGRAPH&#8217;s successful conferences have allowed 
 
                     them to build their required reserve as well as an additional

                     and an email distribution list and a web page available. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Traditionally, budget revenues end up higher

                     at its conference over the last four years are in the 700s 
 
                     range. In addition, SIGCSE joined with SIGCUE to produce ITiCSE&#8217;97, 
 
                     which was the second Joint Conference on Integrating Technology 
 
                     into Computer Science Education. This conference is held in

                     is moderated to avoid inappropriate messages. SIGCSE&#8217;s 
 
                     members are actively involved, typically there are 100-200

                     -- Software Engineering Code of Ethics &amp; Professional 
 
                     Practice<br>
 
                     John Werth reported for Dennis Frailey on the status of the 
 
                     Software Engineering Task Force. In 1993 the IEEE CS and ACM 
 
                     established a Joint Steering Committee for the Establishment 
 
                     of Software Engineering as a profession. The Committee&#8217;s 
 
                     four initial recommendations included adopting standard definitions, 
 
                     defining the body of knowledge and recommended practices, 
 
                     define ethical standards, and define curriculum and related 
 
                     matters. Three task forces were formed to deal with these 
 
                     issues. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In 1997, the Steering Committee was approached 
 
                     by the Engineering Licensing Committee of the Texas Board 
 
                     of Professional Engineers to assist it with the issue of software 
 
                     engineering licensing. The Texas Licensing Committee has formally 
 
                     requested that ACM and IEEE CS jointly work with it to define 
 
                     a body of knowledge on which national engineering licensing 
 
                     exams will be based. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">At its June 17-18, 1998 meeting, in Fort 
 
                     Worth, the Texas Board of Professional Engineers will discuss 
 
                     and possibly enact rules that will recognize software engineering 
 
                     as a distinct engineering discipline. If the rules are enacted, 
 
                     this action will: 1) Allow individuals with acceptable educational 
 
                     credentials and significant levels of active software engineering 
 
                     experience to immediately apply for a license to practice 
 
                     professional engineering in Texas without additional examination; 
 
                     2) Begin the process of developing exams that can be used 
 
                     for licensing software engineering practitioners with less 
 
                     experience to practice professional engineering in Texas. 
 
                     Another outgrowth of this action is that the Texas Board will 
 
                     pursue the national use of any developed exams by the National 
 
                     Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES).</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The question for Council was whether or not 
 
                     to have a proposal at this time, and it was acknowledged that 
 
                     this is a very big topic which requires a serious amount of 
 
                     deliberation. Decisions such as whether ACM should be involved 
 
                     in licensing, and putting together a group to help organize 
 
                     this structure, as well as other concerns, need to be addressed. 
 
                     There were also issues of the time constraints of having to 
 
                     provide input to the Texas Board by its meeting next month. 
 
                     ACM should not abdicate its responsibility in dealing with 
 
                     this issue, however, while perhaps implicitly agreeing that 
 
                     licensing for SE is appropriate at this time, there are larger 
 
                     issues of legal liability. There will have to be individuals 
 
                     within companies who will be liable. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">SE software coming out as a discipline will 
 
                     be challenge, and there will be a need for strong industry 
 
                     representation. It was not known whether industry was driving 
 
                     this issue.<br>
 
                     The Texas Board&#8217;s criteria is that it licenses disciplines 
 
                     less well defined than SE, and that SE used to be a supporting 
 
                     activity, but now is a principle player.</p>

                     Another activity involves a longer timeframe working with 
 
                     the IFIP 3.2 Working Group to look at the body of knowledge,

                     Professional Practice</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Don Gotterbarn, Chair of the Software Engineering 
 
                     Ethics and Practices Task Force, presented an update of the 
 
                     status of the SE Code of Ethics. The purpose of the Code is 
 
                     to document the ethical and professional responsibilities 
 
                     and obligations of software engineers. The TF developed a 
 
                     code for a sub-specialization within the constituencies of 
 
                     both of the professional societies. The proposed draft was 
 
                     published on the web to solicit comments from practitioners 
 
                     and others. It was published in Computer and CACM with a turn-around 
 
                     ballot, and most items received a 95% approval rating. The 
 
                     code was also reviewed by ethics officers of various multi-national 
 
                     corporations, including Lockheed Martin, DEC, Northrop, as 
 
                     well as the British Computer Society, the Australian Computer 
 
                     Society and IFIP. TI and Hitachi have put it on their company 
 
                     bulletin boards for review and comment. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The current draft (4) is ready for review 
 
                     in a formal consensus process. The review process should include 
 
                     balanced selection of representatives from software practitioners, 
 
                     educators, producers, and users. The process should follow 
 
                     the principles of due process such as those used in standards 
 
                     development. Upon completion of the formal review it will 
 
                     be suitable for consideration by the appropriate bodies. The 
 
                     TF recommends that the appropriate committees of ACM and IEEE 
 
                     CS be charged with conducting this formal review. In addition 
 
                     they recommend that the appropriate committees support future 
 
                     activity by the SE Code of Ethics Task Force to address ongoing 
 
                     issues that may arise in this area. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Claus Unger noted that the Code does not 
 
                     say what SE is. In Europe SE is an integral part of Computer 
 
                     Science and there would be no separate Code of Ethics. ACM 
 
                     Code of Ethics is for computing, what makes SE different? 
 
                     Gotterbarn stated that the use of the word &#8220;engineer&#8221; 
 
                     in the UK is not as honorific as in US, and this Code contains 
 
                     practical details of what makes SE an applied science. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Council is being asked to formally adopt 
 
                     this Code of Ethics per Leonard Tripp&#8217;s (President-Elect 
 
                     of IEEE CS) letter (pages 18-20a of backup). Gotterbarn suggested 
 
                     that having a long delay for some minor changes to the Code 
 
                     is not advisable.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Questions of consistency between the two 
 
                     Codes were raised. ACM&#8217;s Code is incumbent on every 
 
                     ACM member; has someone checked to see if these codes are 
 
                     consistent and do we want to have a second set? However, it 
 
                     was noted that this document&#8217;s purpose is to help the 
 
                     profession and not only ACM&#8217;s membership. The suggestion 
 
                     was made to vote on this via an email ballot, providing any 
 
                     possible inconsistencies between ACM&#8217;s Code and the 
 
                     TF&#8217;s Code are corrected. IEEE also has a Code of Ethics 
 
                     which would bring this to three codes.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Some formal process for acceptance must be 
 
                     in place; although some areas might overlap these Codes should 
 
                     not be incompatible. Council would like to see some review 
 
                     for compatibility with ACM&#8217;s Code, and to see if any 
 
                     appropriate further process is required prior to Council approval. 
 
                     Wulf learned that no engineer is considered professional; 
 
                     by law &#8220;professional&#8221; is defined by the Department 
 
                     of Education and its criteria include having at least two 
 
                     years of education beyond the baccalaureate, and being on 
 
                     an enumerated list, and engineering is not on this list.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Council unanimously asked that COPE review 
 
                     the proposed Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional 
 
                     Practice for compatibility/consistency with the ACM Code of 
 
                     Ethics and to determine the appropriate further process, if

                     the public, the professions, educational institutions, and 
 
                     the global community. The Integration Guidelines, developed 
 
                     through discussions between representatives of ACM, ABET, 
 
                     CSAB, and the IEEE, follow: 1) CSAB will become a participating 
 
                     body of the new organization and may have representation on 
 
                     any or all of its accreditation commissions. The ABET algorithm 
 
                     will be used to assign seats to CSAB on the Board of Directors 
 
                     and various commissions and for assessing membership dues. 
 
                     2) The name of the integrated organization will be ABET (not

                     for engineering, technology, and computing sciences programs.&#8221; 
 
                     CSAB will examine its name in view of its new role. 3) Software 
 
                     engineering will be the responsibility of the Engineering 
 
                     Accreditation Commission. CSAB will be the lead society for

                     CSAB will nominate individuals with appropriate qualifications 
 
                     to serve on the EAC. 4) Computer engineering programs will 
 
                     remain in the purview of the Engineering Accreditation Commission 
 
                     (EAC) and CSAB will become a cooperating body for these program. 
 
                     5) A new commission, the Computing Sciences Accreditation 
 
                     Commission, will be formed. Representation on this commission 
 
                     will include CSAB and other participating bodies as determined 
 
                     by the Board of Directors. This commission will initially 
 
                     have responsibility for computer science programs but other 
 
                     programs may be added as appropriate and as they develop. 
 
                     CSAB will be the lead society for computer science and, as 
 
                     appropriate, for other computing programs (e.g., information 
 
                     sciences). 6) Programs which involve more than one of the 
 
                     various accreditation commissions (e.g., computer science 
 
                     and engineering) will be evaluated by a single, combined team 
 
                     and will only require a single visit. 7) The new, integrated 
 
                     accreditation agency will form committees, when appropriate, 
 
                     to resolve issues between its commissions, e.g., as when programs 
 
                     come under the jurisdiction of two or more commissions (such 
 
                     as computer science and engineering programs).</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">It was noted that there seems to be a substantial 
 
                     improvement in this version, and the best deal that could 
 
                     be negotiated. On the downside was the issue of ACM recognition. 
 
                     ACM would be listed in ABET publications, however, this is 
 
                     not a great amount of publicity for ACM since there are 27 
 
                     societies listed in fine print, and it is unlikely that anyone 
 
                     will refer to this list. Also, in terms of ACM garnering publicity 
 
                     the focus should be on ACM 2001. Council thanked Lidtke for 
 
                     her efforts in these negotiations in reaching this achievement.

                   <p align="justify">3.8 Advertising Policy</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The Publications Board was asked to comment 
 
                     on the request from ACM Member Ross to amend the ACM Classified 
 
                     Advertising Policy. The Board reviewed the policy at its meeting 
 
                     on April 24, 1998, and reaffirmed that the current policy 
 
                     is sound and proper for ACM. The Board recommends that Council 
 
                     reaffirm the current policy. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">It is standard practice that the wording 
 
                     of the policy be displayed in every issue so that readers 
 
                     and prospective advertisers will know what the ACM requires 
 
                     of advertisers for disclosure of restrictions on applicants. 
 
                     In the issue that prompted Mr. Ross&#8217;s request, the policy 
 
                     wording was left out because of a large number of ads and 
 
                     space limitations. The Board has directed the advertising 
 
                     department of the CACM to compress the policy wording and 
 
                     include it in the banner of the classified advertising section, 
 
                     thereby guaranteeing that the wording will appear in every 
 
                     issue. </p>

                     which requires that there be two candidates for Council-elective 
 
                     positions. The suspension affects only the election of the 
 
                     Publications Board Chairman at the current meeting. The purpose 
 
                     of this action is to achieve consistency with the proposed

                     for October 17-22 in Vancouver, however, this will be too 
 
                     late for the anticipated timeframe of having the new Executive 
 
                     Director meet Council. Research will be done to see which 
 
                     other conferences are scheduled for late September and will
