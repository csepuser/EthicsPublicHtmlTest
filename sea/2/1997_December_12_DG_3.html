 &gt; &gt; What you fill find below.<br>
 &gt; &gt; 1) We modified the Principles so they can stand alone as a reminder
 of the entire code. The short version is listed first.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS SHORT VERSION AS IT STANDS. IF IT IS NOT MODIFIED,
 I WILL HAVE TO ASK FOR MY NAME TO BE REMOVED.</p>
       <p>SEE MY RESPONSE BELOW</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 2) We shortened the Preamble but also included issues of maintenance.
 We<br>
 &gt; &gt; also tried to clarify that when resolving ethical tension that the
 public interest is paramount.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I think that this was improved by this process.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3) We re?ordered the principles, Putting the PUBLIC first where it
 belongs.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I think that was a good move.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 4) We re?ordered the clauses within each Principle, in general putting
 the more aspiational elements first and the more specific practice items later.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I also think that was good, but in the process it becomes more difficult
 to spot which clauses have been deleted, and some of the ones deleted, I feel,
 ARE important.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 5) We clarified the function of the Code by renaming it.<br>

 &gt; &gt; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE<br>
 &gt; &gt; IEEE-CS/ACM Joint Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and<br>
 &gt; &gt; Professional Practices<br>
 &gt; &gt;<br>
 &gt; &gt; Short Version (Version 4.0)<br>
 &gt; &gt;<br>
 &gt; &gt; Software engineers must commit themselves to making the analysis, specification,
 design, development, testing and maintenance of software<br>
 &gt; &gt; a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their<br>
 &gt; &gt; commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software<br>
 &gt; &gt; engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:</p>
       <p><br>
 &gt; &gt; 1 PUBLIC - Software engineers shall always act in the public interest.</p>
       <p><br>
 &gt; &gt; 2 CLIENT OR EMPLOYER - Software engineers shall act in the best interests
 of their client or employer within the confines of the public interest.</p>
       <p><br>
 &gt; &gt; 3 PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and
 related modifications are of the highest professional standards possible.</p>
       <p><br>
 &gt; &gt; 4 JUDGEMENT - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence
 in their professional judgement.</p>
       <p><br>
 &gt; &gt; 5 MANAGEMENT- Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe
 to and promote an ethical approach to the administration of software development.</p>
       <p><br>
 &gt; &gt; 6 PROFESSION - Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation
 of the profession within the confines of the public interest.</p>
       <p><br>
 &gt; &gt; 7 COLLEAGUES -Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive<br>
 &gt; &gt; of their colleagues.</p>
       <p><br>
 &gt; &gt; 8 SELF - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning
 regarding the practice of their profession.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I feel the lack of warning not to treat this short version as a complete
 code of ethics is a fatal flaw. It would be easy to add a line that it is not
 the complete code, and is only an 'aide memoire' for the full version, which
 itself is not intended to be used so that individual parts in isolation could
 justify errors of omission or commission.</p>
       <p>I THINK BEN'S CONCERN IS VALID AND SUGGEST WE ADD A SENTENCE THAT POINTS
         PEOPLE TO THE FULL CODE AND EXPLAINS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CLAUSES</p>
       <p><br>
 &gt; &gt; SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE<br>
 &gt; &gt; Full Version (Version 4.0) PREAMBLE<br>
 &gt; OK, as said above.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; PRINCIPLES<br>
 &gt; &gt;<br>
 &gt; &gt; Principle 1 PUBLIC Software engineers shall always act in the public
 interest. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Improved.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 1.02. Balance the interests of the software engineer, the employer,
 the<br>
 &gt; &gt; client and the users with the public good.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I am not happy with this change. Cf old 2.07. I would prefer &quot;Moderate
 pursuit of the interests of the software engineer, the employer, the client and
 the users with pursuit of the public good.&quot;</p>
       <p>THIS WAS ALWAYS A PROBLEM IN AN IDEAL WORLD I WOULD GO WITH <br>
   TEMPER/MODERATE IDEA. PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE STRONGER IN OUR DEMAND SUGGEST CHANGE &quot;BALANCE&quot; WITH &quot;MODERATE&quot; AND &quot;WITH&quot; WITH &quot;AGAINST&quot; AND
   MAYBE PUT THE LAST PHRASE AFTER MODERATE</p>
       <p><br>
 &gt; &gt; 1.04. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or
 potential danger to the user, the public, or the environment, that they reasonably
 believe to be associated with software or related documents.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; The deletion of &quot;or merely know about&quot; is detrimental, although
 the deletion of the word 'merely', itself, is appropriate.</p>
       <p>NO I THINK BELIEVE INCLUDES KNOW ABOUT IN THIS CONTEXT</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 1.07. Consider issues of physical disabilities, allocation of resources,
 economic disadvantage and other factors that can diminish access to the benefits
 of software.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Loss of the mentions of language and 'mental access' is detrimental, even
 if the earlier version was poorly expressed. I prefer:<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; 1.07. Endeavour to produce software that respects diversity. Consider issues
 including those of language, economic advantage, allocation of resources, and
 different abilities (including how to make software usable by people with physical
 and sensory impairments, learning difficulties, and conditions such as epilepsy).</p>
       <p>WHILST I HAVE GREAT SYMPATHY WITH THIS I THINK IT BECOMES TOO LONG AND
         TOO DETAILED ? PERHAPS THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE CAN DEVELOP SOME WORKED
         EXAMPLE</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Principle 2 CLIENT OR EMPLOYER Software engineers shall act<br>
 &gt; &gt; in the best interests of their client or employer within the confines
 of the<br>
 &gt; &gt; public interest. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; This has been improved.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 2.01. Provide service in their areas of competence, being honest and<br>
 &gt; &gt; forthright about any limitations of their experience and<br>
 &gt; &gt; education.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; An improvement on the old 4.01<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 2.02. Not knowingly use software that is obtained or retained either<br>
 &gt; &gt; illegally or unethically.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; An improvement on the old 4.04<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 2.04. Ensure that any document upon which they rely has been<br>
 &gt; &gt; approved, when required, by someone authorized to approve it.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; A mild improvement on the old 4.02<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 2.05. Keep private any confidential information gained in their<br>
 &gt; &gt; professional work, where such confidentiality is consistent with<br>
 &gt; &gt; the public interest.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; A mild improvement on the old 4.05<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 2.07. Identify, document, and report significant issues of social<br>
 &gt; &gt; concern, of which they are aware, in software or related<br>
 &gt; &gt; documents to the employer or the client.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; A mild improvement on the old 4.06<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 2.09. Promote no interest adverse to their employer or client, unless
 a<br>
 &gt; &gt; higher ethical concern is being compromised; in that case,<br>
 &gt; &gt; inform the employer or another appropriate authority of the<br>
 &gt; &gt; ethical concern.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; A mild improvement on the old 4.09<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Principle 3 PRODUCT Software engineers shall ensure that their<br>
 &gt; &gt; products and related modifications are of the highest professional<br>
 &gt; &gt; standards possible. In particular, software engineers shall, as<br>
 &gt; &gt; appropriate:<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; The removal of detail improves the sentence. However, loss of the mention<br>
 &gt; of pruducts being *acceptable*, to to the employer, the client, the user<br>
 &gt; and the public creates a deficiency with the code: it should have become<br>
 &gt; a clause.</p>
       <p>IF THEY ARE OF THE HIGHEST PROFESIONAL STANDARDS THEN BY INFERNECE THEY <br>
   WILL BE ACCEPTABLE AS THIS IS PART OF THE DEFINITION OF PROFESSIOANLISM. <br>
   HOWEVER, THE IDEA OF AN EXTRA CLAUSE (OR ADDITION TO AN EXISTING CLAUSE) <br>
   IS WORTH DOING</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3.01. Strive for high quality, acceptable cost and a reasonable<br>
 &gt; &gt; schedule, ensuring significant tradeoffs are clear to the<br>
 &gt; &gt; employer, the client, the user and the public.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Making tradeoffs clear is *not* sufficient to compensate for the loss of<br>
 &gt; the call to strive for high quality and acceptable cost for the employer,<br>
 &gt; client, user, and public.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I also wonder if the wording is *accidentally* deficient in the way it<br>
 &gt; implies &quot;employer, the client, the user and the public&quot; only applies
 to<br>
 &gt; tradeoffs, not to &quot;high quality, acceptable cost and a reasonable<br>
 &gt; schedule&quot;. What about re?ordering the clause to &quot;3.01 For each
 of the<br>
 &gt; employer, client, user and the public: Strive for high quality, acceptable<br>
 &gt; cost and a reasonable schedule, ensuring significant tradeoffs are clear<br>
 &gt; to all parties concerned.&quot;</p>
       <p>THE REWORD IS WRONG WRT SENCE IN THAT IT IS S/W ENGS SHALL ... </p>
       <p>HOW ABOUT ADDING AFTER &quot;TRADEOFFS ARE CLEAR TO&quot; &quot;AND
         ACCEPTED BY&quot;</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3.04. Ensure that they are qualified, by an appropriate combination
 of<br>
 &gt; &gt; education, planned education, and experience, for any project<br>
 &gt; &gt; on which they work or propose to work.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; A mild improvement on the old 1.03<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3.06. Work to follow industry standards when available that are most<br>
 &gt; &gt; appropriate for the task at hand, departing from these only when<br>
 &gt; &gt; technically justified.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; A mild improvement on the old 1.15<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3.08. Ensure that specifications for software on which they work have<br>
 &gt; &gt; been well documented, satisfy the users' requirements, and have<br>
 &gt; &gt; the appropriate approvals.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; A mild improvement on the old 1.01<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3.09. Provide realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, personnel, and<br>
 &gt; &gt; outcomes on any project on which they work or propose to<br>
 &gt; &gt; work and provide a risk assessment of these estimates.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; It may not be a given software engineer's responsibility to *provide* the<br>
 &gt; estimates, but it is always the software engineer's responsiblity to<br>
 &gt; encourage the provision of realistic estimates. The old 1.07 was better<br>
 &gt; than this replacement. At new 5.05 it only applys to leaders. How about<br>
 &gt; &quot;3.09 When asked for estimates, provide realistic estimates of cost,<br>
 &gt; scheduling, personnel, and outcomes on any project on which they work or<br>
 &gt; propose to work and provide a risk assessment of these estimates. Argue<br>
 &gt; against any unrealistic estimates that the software engineer is aware of.&quot;</p>
       <p>I THINK A S/W ENG SHOULD NOT ALWAYS WAIT FOR A REQUEST FOR AN ESTIMATE
         BUT WHERE APPROPRIATE SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING WITHOUT PROMPTING ? SO REJECT
         BEN'S FIRST POINT. I LIKE THE BIT ABOUT ARGUE AGIANST UNREALISTIC ESTIMATES
         AND SUGGEST WE INCORPORATE SOME SIUTABLE WORDS IN THIS CLAUSE.</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3.11. Ensure adequate documentation, including significant problems<br>
 &gt; &gt; discovered and solutions adopted, for any project on which they<br>
 &gt; &gt; work.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; An improvement on the old 1.08, however, it would read better if the word<br>
 &gt; 'of' were inserted between 'including' and 'significant'.</p>
       <p>YES</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3.12. Work to develop software and related documents that respect<br>
 &gt; &gt; the privacy of those who will be affected by that software.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; An improvement on the old 1.10<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3.13. Be careful to use only accurate data derived by ethical and<br>
 &gt; &gt; lawful means, and use only in ways properly authorized.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; An improvement on the old 1.11<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3.14. Maintain the integrity of data being sensitive to outdated or<br>
 &gt; &gt; flawed occurrences<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; An improvement on the old 1.12<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 3.15 Treat software maintenance with the same professionalism as<br>
 &gt; &gt; new development.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I like this.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Principle 4 JUDGEMENT Software engineers shall maintain integrity<br>
 &gt; &gt; and independence in their professional judgement. In particular,<br>
 &gt; &gt; software engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Loss of the mention of &quot;protect the reputation of software engineering,<br>
 &gt; provided such protection is consistent with principle 1&quot; is detrimental.
 I<br>
 &gt; wonder whether it should be a clause.</p>
       <p>NO ?I THINK WE COVER THIS IN OTHER WAYS</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 4.02 Only endorse documents prepared under their supervision or<br>
 &gt; &gt; within their areas of competence and with which they are in<br>
 &gt; &gt; agreement.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Good. Covers all of the old 2.03 and the old 3.02, in a better way.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 4.04. Do not engage in deceptive financial practices such as bribery,<br>
 &gt; &gt; secret payments and double billing.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Improves on the old 3.03, 3.04 and 3.05, BUT the new 4.04 DOES NOT FIT<br>
 &gt; WITH THE SENTENCE STRUCTURE. (perhaps 'do not' could be replaced by<br>
 &gt; 'never'?).</p>
       <p>M DAVIES COMMENTS COVER THIS</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 4.06. Refuse to participate, as members or advisors, in a governmental<br>
 &gt; &gt; or professional body concerned with software related issues, in<br>
 &gt; &gt; which they, their employers, or their clients have undisclosed<br>
 &gt; &gt; potential conflicts of interest.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; This is an improvement but 'conflicts of interest' doesn't seem right to<br>
 &gt; me (can you really have a conflict of intererst IN a governmental or<br>
 &gt; professional body?) I would suggest &quot;... undisclosed interests which<br>
 &gt; could bias or appear to bias opinions expressed or actions taken&quot; would
 be<br>
 &gt; better.</p>
       <p>I THINK YOU CAN HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST EG ADVICE ON REGULATION THAT <br>
   WILL DETRIMENTALLY AFFECT YOUR COMPANY BUT IS TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE <br>
   PUBLIC. OR PROF BODY THAT WANTS TO HIRE YOUR COMPANY TO DO SOME <br>
   CONSULTANCY AND YOU ARE ON THE PROF BODY'S BOARD</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Principle 5 MANAGEMENT Software engineering managers and<br>
 &gt; &gt; leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the<br>
 &gt; &gt; administration of software development. In particular, those managing<br>
 &gt; &gt; and leading software engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; The principle is improved, however, the loss of<br>
 &gt; 1) acting fairly (in general) and<br>
 &gt; 2) &quot;enable and encourage those who they lead to meet their own and<br>
 &gt; collective obligations, including those under this code&quot;<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; from the code as a whole is severely detrimental. They could be a new<br>
 &gt; 5.01 and 5.02 (with the following clauses renumbered).</p>
       <p>NOT CONVINCED ? LEAVE AS IS</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 5.01 Ensure good management for any project on which they work,<br>
 &gt; &gt; including effective procedures for promotion of quality and<br>
 &gt; &gt; reduction of risk.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Rightly moved from old 1.06<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 5.12. Not punish a software engineer for expressing ethical concerns<br>
 &gt; &gt; about a project.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Is a good addition. However, as with the new 5.02, 5.03, 5.06, 5.09, 5.11<br>
 &gt; (which follow in this email), 5.12 mentions 'software engineer' rather<br>
 &gt; than covering all employees. The clauses replaced mentioned all<br>
 &gt; employees, and in these cases it is appropriate. A software engineer may<br>
 &gt; be leading a team that includes people other than sofware engineers (for<br>
 &gt; example administrative support). The good software engineer should not<br>
 &gt; punish *any* employee for expressing ethical concerns about a project,<br>
 &gt; or ask any employee to do anything inconsistent with this Code, or<br>
 &gt; attract any potential employee other than by full and accurate<br>
 &gt; description of the conditions of employment, or hold any employee to<br>
 &gt; standards before they are informed of them; etc.</p>
       <p>INTERESTING ? SUGGEST WE CHANGE &quot;A SOFTWARE ENGINEER&quot; TO &quot;ANYONE&quot; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 5.02. Ensure that software engineers are informed of standards before<br>
 &gt; &gt; being held to them.<br>
 &gt; &gt; 5.03. Ensure that software engineers know the employer's policies and<br>
 &gt; &gt; procedures for protecting passwords, files, and other<br>
 &gt; &gt; confidential information.<br>
 &gt; &gt; 5.06. Attract potential software engineers only by full and accurate<br>
 &gt; &gt; description of the conditions of employment.<br>
 &gt; &gt; 5.09. Ensure that there is a fair agreement concerning ownership of<br>
 &gt; &gt; any software, processes, research, writing, or other intellectual<br>
 &gt; &gt; property to which a software engineer has contributed.<br>
 &gt; &gt; 5.11. Not ask a software engineer to do anything inconsistent with
 this<br>
 &gt; &gt; Code.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Principle 6 PROFESSION Software engineers shall advance the<br>
 &gt; &gt; integrity and reputation of the profession within the confines of the<br>
 &gt; &gt; public interest. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Mildly improved.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; THE DELETION OF THE OLD 6.07 IS A SERIOUSLY DETRIMENTAL CHANGE TO THE<br>
 &gt; SUBSTANCE OF THE CODE.</p>
       <p>I DON'T THINK IT IS THAT BAD</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 6.03. Extend software engineering knowledge by appropriate<br>
 &gt; &gt; participation in professional organizations, meetings and<br>
 &gt; &gt; publications.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; An improvement on the old 6.13<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 6.04. Support, as members of a profession, other software engineers<br>
 &gt; &gt; striving to follow this Code.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; An improvement on the old 6.04<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 6.06. Obey all laws governing their work, unless, in exceptional<br>
 &gt; &gt; circumstances, such compliance is inconsistent with the public<br>
 &gt; &gt; interest.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Change from old 6.10 is OK<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 6.10. Avoid associations with disreputable businesses and<br>
 &gt; &gt; organizations.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Change from old 6.01 is OK<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 6.11. Consider, as a profession, that violations of this Code are<br>
 &gt; &gt; inconsistent with being a professional software engineer.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; I do not see how individuals can consider 'as a profession'. Those words<br>
 &gt; should be deleted.</p>
       <p>AGREE</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 6.12. Express concerns to the people involved when significant<br>
 &gt; &gt; violations of this Code are detected.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; The words &quot;unless this is impossible, dangerous or ineffective&quot; should
 be<br>
 &gt; added at the end of this clause in addition to having been added to the<br>
 &gt; following one.</p>
       <p>AGREE</p>
       <p>&gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 6.13. Report significant violations of this Code to appropriate<br>
 &gt; &gt; authorities when consultation about the problems has proven<br>
 &gt; &gt; impossible, dangerous or ineffective.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Principle 7 COLLEAGUES Software engineers shall be fair to and<br>
 &gt; &gt; supportive of their colleagues. In particular, software engineers shall,
 as<br>
 &gt; &gt; appropriate:<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; A slight improvement.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 7.02. Credit fully the work of others and refrain from taking undue<br>
 &gt; &gt; credit.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; An improvement on the old 7.03<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 7.06. Not unfairly intervene in the career of any colleague; however,<br>
 &gt; &gt; concern for the employer, the client or public interest may<br>
 &gt; &gt; compel software engineers, in good faith, to question the<br>
 &gt; competence<br>
 &gt; &gt; of a colleague.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; A big improvement on the old 7.07 and 7.08<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; Principle 8 SELF Software engineers shall participate in lifelong<br>
 &gt; &gt; learning regarding the practice of their profession. In particular,<br>
 &gt; &gt; software engineers shall continually endeavor to:<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Slightly worse than the previous version.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 8.01. Further their knowledge of developments in the analysis,<br>
 &gt; &gt; specification, design, development, maintenance and testing of<br>
 &gt; &gt; software and related documents, together with the management<br>
 &gt; &gt; of the development process.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Improved.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 8.07. Not influence others to undertake any action which involves a<br>
 &gt; &gt; breach of this Code.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; Improved.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; &gt; 8.08. Encourage colleagues to adhere to this Code.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; This doesn't appear to me to be suitable for the 'self' principle.<br>
 &gt; <br>
 &gt; The old 8.08. &quot;Consider violations of this code inconsistent with being
 a<br>
 &gt; professional software engineer and encourage colleagues to adhere to<br>
 &gt; this code.&quot; should be retained, but clarity would be improved by the<br>
 &gt; insertion of the word 'personal' after 'consider'. The new 6.11 does not<br>
 &gt; cover this PERSONAL aspect.</p>
       <p>M DAVIES COMMENT SUGGESTS 8.08 BE SHIFTED</p>
       <p>SUGGEST WE HAVE 8.08 AS &quot; Consider violations of this code inconsistent<br>
   with being a professional software engineer&quot;</p>
