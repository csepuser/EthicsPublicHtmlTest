   IMPORTANT -- Please tell us about your specific interests and how your experience
     will aid this project. I deal with the education of future SEs and I believe
     that it is of great importance to teach them RIGHT early on. I Used to teach
     Doctoral level courses back in the states and many of my students were part
     timers working for big organizations. Many of them did not believe in SE
     and were still relying on &quot;ad-hoc&quot; techniques not only in civil
     applications, but in mission critical applications as well!</p>
       <p>I also do private consultation for industry. So I see both ends:<br>
   Academic and practice.</p>
       <p>Enforcing acceptable ethical/professional responsibilities on SEs<br>
   I fell is part of my duty as a scholar and a practicing SE.<br>

   IMPORTANT -- Please tell us about your specific interests and how<br>
   your experience will aid this project.</p>
       <p>I would like to be involved in the Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
         Practices task force, in particular the Professional Competence working
         group.</p>
       <p>This is a critical item that needs to be addressed before the software
         industry can mature further. There are to many projects and packages
         that leave unfulfilled promises. I believe the disenchantment with the
         software industry and it's inability to be viewed as an engineering discipline
         is in part caused by &quot;vendors&quot; attitudes that, &quot;promises,
         functionality, quality&quot; do not matter. This needs to change and
         I think this is one way to help enlighten people in the industry that
         this industry needs to take itself seriously and it is not just here
         to create games and the like.</p>
       <p>I currently work for a systems integration company and unfortunately
         see first hand misunderstandings and the bad feelings that result from
         the disconnects. I am very passionate about this topic and feel this
         is one way I can help further the industry along and would like to be
         part of this working group.</p>
       <p>I am currently a member of IEEE, the Computer Society, and have been
         involved in commenting on and voting on standards from the Software Engineering
         Standards Subcommittees.<br>

       <p>My interest is in the furtherance of SW Engineering as a professional
         activity. My observation is that ANYONE and EVERYONE seems to believe
         they can develop SW applications. Many of these follow no consistent
         process or provide any supporting products to aid in maintaining these
         applications. This gives legitimate SW professionals a bad name. I believe
         that ethical standards may provide and approach to solving this problem.
         I have 20 years' of experience in developing real-time applications for
         visual simulation applications. I have dealt with a number of these semi-SW
         professionals and believe that this experience will be useful to the
         ethical standards effort.</p>

       <p>_I have been conducting research into ethics attitudes and practices
         among information systems professionals for about _five years. I also
         teach information sytsems majors at the university. I am also interested
         in discussing and understanding the ethics views of IS professionals
         so I can personally stay up on &quot;the rules of the game.&quot; In
         summary, I want to understand IS ethics for research, for teaching, and
         to guide own professional behavior.</p>

       <p>I am concerned about the need to create Software Engineering as a Profession.<br>
   I believe that present academic qualifications are insufficient to judge a
     persons competance in the computer industry.<br>
   I do not have any academic qualifications, am lousy at maths, and still have<br>
   managed to become MIS manager at one of Irelands largest PLCs. I am now<br>
   techical director of the Trinity Group (Ireland second largest DEC reseller)<br>
   and have just launched an electronic mail service company. <br>
   Most of the people I know who have 3rd level qualifications and are working<br>
   in the computer industry, do not hold their degrees in computer-related subjects.</p>
       <p>I agree with the need for &quot;formalise&quot; all aspects of the computer
         profession,<br>
   but I want to see real, industry-related testing. For instance, the skills
   required of a commercial programmer (writing business applications) are different
   from those of one writing an operating system.<br>
   I have just employed a graduate who holds a degree, diploma, and certificate
   in computer science. When asked to plug a modem into a PC, she asked which<br>
   port was the comm port- She had never had to do this on her courses.<br>
   In a previous job, I employed a commercial programmer with no academic qualifications.
   She was programming *productively* in two days. I then, deliberately, employed
   a &quot;junior&quot; for her. This junior-programmer was the top of his class
   in a computer-applications degree. It took nearly 4-months before he could
   be allowed work independantly.</p>
       <p>I have been working in the industry for 15 years since I left school.
         I have been a programmer, network manager, MIS manager and consultant.</p>

   I was chair of the IEEE COPP subcommittee on privacy and security,<br>
   and was invited to write the introduction of the first annual<br>
   symposium on computer privacy and security.</p>
       <p> I am now chair of the IEEE Technical Committee for application of<br>
   computers to aid people with disabilities. My main claim to<br>
   fame/competence is having developed the &quot;EyeMouse&quot; a device to allow<br>
   people with severe mobility impairments to &quot;type with their eyes&quot;,
   for<br>
   which we have won several prizes (from Microsoft, Zenith, Smithsonian<br>

       <p>As a practitioner and academic with over 20 years experience I am deeply
         concerned about the way software engineering is managed and how societal
         impacts are considered and taken into account. At De Montfort University,
         I have been instrumental in developing and implementing modules relating
         to these issues on our<br>
   undergraduate and postgraduate portfolios. Currently, I am pioneering a Computing
   Ethics module for final year students on our modular scheme. I am very keen
   to increase the awareness of ethics and professionalism in the UK and as such
   I am organising, in conjunction with Professor Bynum of Southern Connecticut
   State University, an international conference, ETHICOMP95, next March which
   addresses the ethical issues of IT exploitation. </p>
       <p>At a national level, I am involved with the Institute of Data Processing
         Management and currently serve on their Education Committee. I am a member
         of the Parliamentary<br>
   IT committee, the aim of which is to inform Government of the current trends
   in IT and how IT can be sympathetically utilised. I am also involved with the
   Higher Education Funding Council of England acting as a special assessor in
   Computer Science for quality assurance exercises.</p>
       <p>I would very much welcome the opportunity of participating in the working
         groups I have indicated and feel that my background, experience and contacts
         would add value to the project as a whole. I would also like to be kept
         informed of progress on the other working groups</p>
       <p>I look forward to hearing from you.<br>

         Having us review other software<br>
   developers' work is a role that seems to be gaining popularity with our clients.</p>
       <p>I have worked in both large and small environments, and have witnessed
         both noteworthy honesty and ethical conduct, and the extreme opposite,
         by both software developers and end-users. I can bring to the project
         a knowledge of the conflicts that arise in a large corporate environment,
         where high billings sometimes push against the boundaries of ethics.
         As well, as the President of of a small firm, I can contribute knowledge
         of the problems and solutions faced by small companies and independent
         developers. Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in
         these working groups.<br>
