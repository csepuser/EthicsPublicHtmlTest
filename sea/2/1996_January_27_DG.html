       <p>Don -
       <p>Sorry it took two weeks for this to get to the top of my queue, but
         here it is.</p>
       <p>Below is a version of the SEEPP TF &quot;Guide to Operations&quot; that
         attempts to recall the changes we made at the 3/95 meeting in D.C.</p>
       <p>Following the Guide is output from applying the UNIX diff program to
         the 2/94 draft of the guide and the version below. Let me know if you
         need help interpreting the diff output, but hey --man diff. The diff
         output shows more changed text than there actually is because I re-justified
         the paragraphs I changed. I've annotated the diff output to indicate
         the Guide paragraph in which the change belongs.</p>
       <p>These changes have been constructed using my notes made at the time.
         The notes were not complete, and in many cases were but a few words intended
         to convey the idea or the change. I've written new language using the
         notes as a basis, but do not pretend that my language here replicates
         the language we came up with together at that meeting.</p>
       <p>There were two instances where I merely noted the word &quot;change&quot; with
         an arrow pointing to the affected text. I have not attempted a reconstruction
         in these instances, but have merely highlighted the area. Perhaps this
         identification will jog someone's memory; I have no independent recollection
         of those changes.</p>

         1. Overview</p>
       <p>This guide discusses how to manage the development of draft IEEE- CS/ACM
         standards for software engineering ethical and professional practices.
         While these draft standards are not being formulated under the auspices
         of a formal IEEE Standards Project Authorization Request (commonly known
         as a &quot;PAR&quot;), these standards documents are to be developed
         in accordance with appropriate IEEE and Computer Society Standard's Policies
         and Procedures.</p>
       <p>The IEEE standards development process includes two volunteer groups:
         a Sponsor such as the SEEPP task force, who supervises all phases of
         the development of a standard, and a standards developing committee such
         as a Working Group (WG), which is responsible to the Sponsor, and which
         develops the draft standard. A SEEPP draft standard will be forwarded
         to the IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors and the ACM Council for
         action once it has met IEEE balloting approval criteria (see below).</p>
       <p> 1.1 Scope</p>
       <p>This guide is intended for use by the SEEPP task force, its WG Chairpersons
         and members.</p>

       <p>This guide is derived from the reference documents listed above. Where
         it is ambiguous or inconsistent, the following documents will have precedent,
         with higher precedence indicated by earlier appearance on the following
         list):</p>
       <p>IEEE Standards Board Bylaws, IEEE Standards Operations Manual, IEEE
         CS SAB P&amp;P.</p>
       <p> 3. Definitions</p>
       <p>3.1 IEEE Standards</p>
       <p>IEEE Standards include but are not limited to</p>
       <p> --Standards: documents with mandatory requirements. (Mandatory requirements
         are generally characterized by use of the verb &quot;shall.&quot;) </p>
       <p>--Recommended practices: documents in which procedures and positions
         preferred by the IEEE are presented. (Recommended practices normally
         use the verb &quot;should.&quot;) </p>
       <p>-- Guides: documents in which alternative approaches to good practice
         are suggested but no clear-cut recommendations are made. </p>
       <p>-- Trial-use documents: publications that are effective for not more
         than two years. They can be any of the categories of standards publications
         listed above.</p>
       <p>IEEE Standards are signified by the use of the upper-case &quot;S&quot; in
         the word &quot;Standards.&quot; (IEEE Standards activities operate under
         the umbrella of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as one
         of several accredited standards developing organizations. ANSI is a member
         entity of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).)</p>
       <p>3.2 IEEE-CS/ACM SEEPP draft standards</p>
       <p>SEEPP draft standards include but are not limited to</p>
       <p> --standards: documents with mandatory requirements. (Mandatory requirements
         are generally characterized by use of the verb &quot;shall.&quot;) </p>
       <p>-- recommended practices: documents in which procedures and positions
         preferred by the IEEE are presented. (Recommended practices normally
         use the verb &quot;should.&quot;) </p>
       <p>-- guides: documents in which alternative approaches to good practice
         are suggested but no clear-cut recommendations are made. </p>
       <p>-- trial-use documents: publications that are effective for not
           more than two years. They can be any of the categories of standards
       publications listed above.</p>
       <p align="center">-2-</p>
       <p>The draft standards developed by the SEEPP WG's are signified by the
         using the lower-case &quot;s&quot; in the word &quot;standard,&quot; whenever
         grammatically permitted. This convention shall be followed to distinguish
         SEEPP standards from approved IEEE Standards.</p>
       <p>3.3 &quot;Standard(s)&quot;</p>
       <p>The independent use of the word &quot;standard,&quot; or its plural
         (i.e., without a leading 'IEEE' or 'IEEE-CS/ACM SEEPP') may be used generically
         in reference to standards, recommended practices, and guide documents,
         based on context. This is consistent with IEEE Standards practice and
         this guide's definition 3.1.</p>

       <p> 4. Working Groups</p>
       <p>Working groups (WGs) exist to organize the technical development of
         a draft standard.</p>
       <p>4.1 Management &amp; operation</p>
       <p>4.1.1 Meetings</p>
       <p>Working group meetings shall be held in a manner and with a frequency
         appropriate to facilitate the expeditious delivery of a draft standard
         appropriate for delivery to the IEEE-CS BoG and ACM Council. Meetings
         may be conducted in person, by IT-facilitated methods (e.g., e-mail),
         or in combination. Meeting dates, times, methods (technology), locations
         and frequency shall be determined by the WG Chairperson.</p>
       <p align="center"> -3- </p>
       <p>4.1.2 Quorum IEEE-CS SAB P&amp;Ps </p>
       <p>The quorum for WGs shall be one-half (50%) of the attending WG members.
         For WG business conducted by electronic mail, subscription to the electronic
         mailing list designated by the WG Chair for such purpose list constitutes
         attendance.</p>
       <p>A majority of non-abstaining attendees shall be required to conduct
         WG business. A non-response to a call for a vote is an abstention.</p>
       <p>4.1.3 Voting/consensus</p>
       <p>During the draft standard development cycle, WG Chairs have the discretion
         to use as expeditious a method as needed to establish the WG membership's
         consensus on any issue. In extreme cases, a formal vote of the WG membership
         may be necessary. Robert's Rules of Order (RROO) should be invoked to
         govern any fractious debate or vote.</p>
       <p>4.1.4 The first draft</p>
       <p>After establishing a draft Scope, (see clause 4.1.4.1.), the WG should
         outline the important issues and sub-topics it thinks the standard should
         address (see clause 4.1.4.2). The WG should also establish the nature
         of the standard it is to develop (i.e., standard, recommend practice,
         guide, etc., see 4.1.4.3).</p>
       <p>Although it does not have to be included in the text of the standard,
         the WG should clearly and concisely define the purpose of the document.
         This generally describes &quot;why&quot; the document is being developed.
         For example:</p>
       <p> &quot;Purpose: Full-range current limiting fuses are not currently
         covered by standards. In fulfilling this need, the working group will
         also define and recommend an overall action plan to clarify and improve
         industry understanding for all types of fuses.&quot;</p>
       <p>The WG Chairperson should then identify an individual to author an initial
         draft. The author should be permitted to prepare the draft with or without
         additional input or assistance from any other WG members, at his or her
         discretion. The consensus of the WG membership should then be evaluated
         to determine if the completed draft can subsequently serve as the foundation
         for an iterative process of refinement.</p>
       <p>4.1.4.1 Scope</p>
       <p>The WG must clearly and concisely define the scope of the document.
         The scope generally describes &quot;what&quot; will be affected, i.e.,
         the technical boundaries of the document. For example:</p>
       <p> &quot;Scope: Communications equipment that is to operate in electric
         power generating stations and in generation, transmission, and distribution
         substations.&quot;</p>
       <p> &quot;Scope: Interface systems used to interconnect both programmable
         and nonprogrammable electronic measuring apparatus with other apparatus
         and accessories necessary  to assemble instrumentation systems.&quot;</p>
       <p align="center">-4-</p>
       <p> &quot;Scope: Peer-review panels or committees used to assess a Software
         Engineer's, or a Software Engineering Organization's conduct with respect
         to avoiding or resolving ethical conflicts.&quot;</p>
       <p>4.1.4.2 Outline IEEE Guide to Standards Development </p>
       <p>The outline should be consistent with the requirements of the IEEE Standards
         Style Manual (see clause 5. in this guide).</p>
       <p>Two outline styles are used for standards. Each WG should be aware of
         the advantages and disadvantages of both styles.</p>
       <p>1) The first is that of the standard that states only requirements.
         This type of standard may then be followed by a guide, which provides
         guidance, examples, tutorial material, etc. The advantage of this approach
         is that it permits the scope of each effort to be restricted to a finite
         task, allowing each effort to be completed relatively quickly. 2) The
         second is the standard that incorporates guidance or tutorial material
         or both, in addition to requirements. This has the advantage of adding
         clarity to the standard. The disadvantage of this approach is that it
         may preclude the standard from being completed in a timely manner. Due
         to the amount of material being reviewed, it may take so long from the
         start of the project to its conclusion that all concerned may lose interest
         and leave.</p>
       <p>4.1.4.3 Appropriate title</p>
       <p>A title should include the type of document. For example:</p>
       <p>a) *Standard* Policies and Procedures for Establishing and Operating
         an Ethics Peer review Panel for Software Engineering Activities. b) *Recommended
         Practices* for Resolving Ethical Conflict ...</p>
       <p>The title shall not contain the words &quot;IEEE&quot; or &quot;ACM.&quot;</p>
       <p>4.1.5 Resolving changes</p>
       <p>The WG may use the methodology discussed in clause 4.3.6, below.</p>
       <p>4.2 WG Membership</p>
       <p>4.2.1 Requirements</p>
       <p>The requirement for WG membership is a direct and material interest
         and willingness to participate in the activities of the WG. </p>
       <p align="center">-5-</p>
       <p>WG members shall participate in a manner consistent with their professional
         expert opinion as individuals, or as an organizational representative,
         but not both.</p>
       <p>4.2.2 Expiration/Revocation IEEE-CS SAB P&amp;P's </p>
       <p>Membership for WG members (other than Officers) shall by default expire
         upon the third (3rd) consecutive regularly-scheduled meeting of the WG
         not attended by the member, unless the WG Chair determines there is good
         cause for an absence. For purposes of determining membership under this
         paragraph only, an vote conducted by electronic mail or other electronic
         means shall constitute a meeting.</p>
       <p>A notice shall be sent by the WG Chair to the member whose membership
         status is at risk in advance of the meeting at which the membership would
         expire.</p>
       <p>4.2.3 Elections of Chairs and Vice-Chairs IEEE?CS SAB P&amp;P's </p>
       <p>WG Chairs shall be elected by the WG and confirmed by the SEEPP TF.
         The term for Chair shall be two (2) years.</p>
       <p>Initial appointments, and temporary appointments to fill vacancies due
         to resignations or removals may be made by the Co?Chairs of the SEEPP
         TF, and shall be valid for no longer than six (6) months. Chairs and
         Vice?Chairs may be re?elected up to four (4) times.</p>
       <p>4.2.3.1 Removal of Chairs or Vice-Chairs IEEE-CS SAB P&amp;P's </p>
       <p>The SEEPP TF may remove the Chair of a WG for cause.</p>
       <p>The Co-Chairs of the SEEPP TF shall give the individual subject to removal
         a minimum of thirty (30) days written mail notice, with proof of delivery,
         of a meeting of the SEEPP TF at which the removal is to be decided. Such
         notice shall include the specific reasons for the proposed removal. The
         individual subject to removal shall have the opportunity to confront
         the evidence for removal, and to argue in his or her behalf.</p>
       <p>In the clear and documented case of gross misconduct, the Chair of the
         SEEPP TF may suspend the Chair of the WG, with the concurrence of the
         Chair of the Joint IEEE Computer Society/ACM Steering Committee for Establishing
         Software Engineering as a</p>
       <p align="center"> -6-</p>
       <p>Profession. A meeting or teleconference of the SEEPP TF shall be
           convened as soon as practical, but in no case later than thirty (30)
           days, to review the suspension as provided for above.</p>
       <p>4.3 Balloting</p>
       <p>Balloting shall provide for the development of consensus by all interests
         significantly affected by the scope of the standard. This is achieved
         by establishing a balloting group (or body) membership that balances
         such interests. Balance is defined as the avoidance of dominance by any
         single interest category IEEE Standards Operations Manual, 5.4.1 </p>
       <p>The balloting body is composed of WG voting members and all other appropriate
         individuals and organizational representatives.</p>
       <p>4.3.1 Process</p>
       <p>The balloting process consists of the following steps:</p>
       <p>Step responsible oversight <br>
   (1) Approval to ballot WG SEEPP TF<br>
   (2) Invitation to ballot issued SEEPP TF N/A<br>
   (3) Creation of balloting body SEEPP TF N/A<br>
   (4) Ballot SEEPP TF N/A<br>
   (5) Ballot resolution WG SEEPP TF<br>
   (6) Approval to forward to<br>
   CS BoG/ACM Council WG/SEEPP TF JtStr</p>
       <p>4.3.2 Balloting Body</p>
       <p>The WG Chair shall request that the SEEPP task force form a balloting
         body for the purpose of conducting the ballot.</p>
       <p>The balloting body for a standard is comprised of all individuals or
         organizational representatives (OR) who have expressed a direct and material
         interest in the scope of the proposed standard.</p>
       <p>Those returning a request to the SEEPP TF to be included in the balloting
         body should indicate their interest category (see 4.3.4), and their agreement
         to return the ballot form and their comments within ten (10) days of
         receipt of the ballot. </p>
       <p> I have a note that the bracketed phrase above was changed at the 3/95
         meeting, but no note of what the change was. -SEB 1/27/96 </p>
       <p>The SEEPP TF Co?chairs' are responsible for ensuring that the balloting
         body meets the requirements of balance at the time the balloting body
         is formed, as described in 4.3.3 or in the IEEE Standards Operations
         Manual, and that there is no attempt to dominate the ballot by a special
         interest group.</p>
       <p>4.3.3 Balance</p>
       <p>The standard's balloting body shall be balanced by classifying the</p>
       <p align="center"> -7-</p>
       <p>relationship of each member of the balloting body relative to the scope
         of the target standard. Standards balloting bodies shall consist of no
         more than one-half (50%) of participants from any category except &quot;individual
         professional.&quot; Organizational representatives may elect to ballot
         as the OR, or as an individual, but not both.</p>
       <p>4.3.4 Interest categories</p>
       <p>Balloting interest categories shall be established by the WG relative
         to a standard's scope. The SEEPP TF shall approve the balloting interest
         categories prior to issuing a invitation to ballot. By default, the following
         interest categories will be used: individual professional, academic,
         organizational representative, or end user/general interest.</p>
       <p>4.3.5 The ballot 1993 IEEE Standards Operations Manual, 5.4.3.1 </p>
       <p>The ballot shall provide three choices:</p>
       <p>a) Approve (Affirmative): This vote may be accompanied by comments suggesting
         corrections and improvements. Action on such comments is left to the
         discretion of the WG.</p>
       <p> b) Do Not Approve (Negative): This vote shall be accompanied by specific
         reasons in sufficient detail so that the specific wording of the changes
         that will cause the negative voter to change his or her vote to &quot;approve&quot; can
         be readily be determined. If the changes are made, then the vote automatically
         becomes affirmative. In the absence of reasons for a negative vote, the
         ballot shall, after a follow-up inquiry, be classified as &quot;no response.&quot;</p>
       <p> c) Abstain: This category is provided to allow for ballot returns from
         members who do not wish to review documents because of conflict of interest,
         lack of expertise, or other reasons. A reason shall be given for this
         vote; otherwise, the ballot shall be classified as &quot;no response.&quot;</p>
       <p>For a standards ballot to be effective, at least 75% of the ballots
         shall be returned. In the event that the 75% return from the balloting
         group cannot be obtained, the balloting process is considered to have
         failed. In the event that 30% or more of the ballots are abstentions,
         the ballot shall be considered invalid. Further disposition of the document
         shall be the responsibility of the SEEPP TF. A minimum of 75% of those
         voting affirmative or negative must approve the draft in order to submit
         the draft to the IEEE-CS BoG and the ACM Council.</p>
       <p>The SEEPP TF is only obligated to consider ballots that are received
         by the close of the ballot. The ballot shall close at the end of business
         on the date specified on the ballot or when a 75% return of the balloting
         group is received. This extension for receipt of a 75% return shall be
         no longer than 60 days.</p>
       <p> I have a note that the preceding paragraph was changed in the 3/95
         meeting, but no record of the change itself. I have a cryptic note about
         the meaning of &quot;extension&quot; and, looking at the text today,
         I imagine I might have asked the the paragraph be changed so that that
         it was clear who decides to grant any extension.-SEB 1/27/96 </p>
       <p align="center"> -8-</p>
       <p> 4.3.6 Resolution of comments, objections, and negative votes 1993
           IEEE Standards Operations Manual, 5.4.3.2 </p>
       <p>The WG shall review all ballots received and shall make every attempt
         to resolve comments, objections, and negative votes favorably. Comments
         pointing out obvious mistakes, typographical errors, and improvements
         in punctuation, grammar, and composition, which do not change the material
         meaning, may be accepted, revised, or rejected. It must be borne in mind
         that documents are professionally edited prior to final publication. </p>
       <p>Comments accompanying affirmative votes that advocate changes in the
         material meaning of the document may be accepted, revised, or rejected.</p>
       <p>Changes may be made in the document to resolve negative votes or for
         other reasons. If the negative vote is not satisfied, either entirely
         or in part, the negative voter shall be informed of the reasons for the
         rejection and be given an opportunity either to change his or her vote
         to &quot;approve&quot; or to retain his or her negative vote.</p>
       <p>All material changes made in the final draft to resolve comments, objections,
         and negative votes, and all unresolved negative votes, together with
         the reasons of the negative voter and the rebuttal by the WG members
         conducting the resolution of the ballots, shall be submitted to the balloting
         group, providing each member an opportunity to change his or her ballot.
         Names of the unresolved negative balloters are to be included with their
         negative comments in the recirculation of negative comments. Further
         resolution efforts may be required if additional negative votes result.</p>
       <p>Proposed draft standards receiving a significant number of unresolved
         negative votes should be considered by the SEEPP TF for trial?use (see
         IEEE Standards Operations Manual, clause 5.7)</p>
       <p>5. Style</p>
       <p>The IEEE Standards Style Manual is the definitive source for guidance
         in formatting draft standards documents. The Style Manual also describes
         the optional and required contents of the drafts. Additionally, as the
         Style Guide notes in its introduction:</p>
       <p> &quot;In some cases, it is necessary and appropriate to accommodate
         special requirements. Standards developers should keep in mind that flexibility
         is allowed, and that IEEE Standards Project Editors are available to
         assist working groups in designing drafts that will suite their particular
         requirements.&quot;</p>
       <p align="center"> -9- </p>
       <p>Of particular interest to the SEEPP TF working groups will be the
         Style Manual's clauses 5 and 6: &quot;Content of drafts,&quot; and &quot;General
         style,&quot; respectively.</p>
       <p>Generally, standards documents are divided into four or more clauses,
         as follows:</p>
       <p> Clause Title/subject </p>
       <p>1. Introduction<br>
   2. Scope<br>
   3. Definitions<br>
   4. Main text of the standard<br>
   4+n Additional text of the standard (optional)</p>
       <p>Style Manuals will be provided to WG Chairs by the SEEPP TF or they
         may be obtained from the IEEE-CS office (check with Deirdre Bagley, 202?371-0101,
