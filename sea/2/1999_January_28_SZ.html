       <p>1. Introductions and Logistics<br>
   This was the first meeting of the Software Engineering Coordinating Committee
     (SWECC), a joint activity of the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society (CS).
     The meeting began with self-introductions of all present:</p>
       <p>&#8226; Leonard Tripp (Chair, CS)</p>
       <p>&#8226; Dennis Frailey (Vice-chair, ACM)</p>
       <p>&#8226; Mark Ardis (ACM SIGSOFT)</p>
       <p>&#8226; Doris Carver (CS Education)</p>
       <p>&#8226; Karl Reed (CS TCSE)</p>
       <p>&#8226; Laurie Werth (proxy for Linda Northrop, ACM Education)</p>
       <p>We agreed that important decisions of SWECC would be captured as Resolutions.
         Each resolution would be prepared in written form by a sponsor. All resolutions
         passed by SWECC would be published in the minutes. Creation and completion
         of projects will be done by resolution. Other procedures for the committee
         will unfold over time.</p>
       <p>Mark Ardis agreed to be the recorder for this meeting. Future recorders
         will be chosen by self-nomination or rotation.</p>
       <p>We agreed to the agenda as planned.</p>
       <p>2. Overview and History of SWECC Project<br>
   Leonard Tripp presented an overview of SWECC. (See slides in Overview of SWECC.
     ) The charter of the committee is to &quot;foster and maintain software engineering
     as a professional computing discipline&quot;. It was created as a joint effort
     of ACM and IEEE CS as a successor to the previous Joint Committee to Establish
     Software Engineering as a Profession.</p>
       <p>Although some of the stimuli for the creation of SWECC were the recent
         action by ABET to establish software engineering accreditation and the
         recent action of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers to license
         software engineers, both technical societies consider SWECC to be an
         international effort.</p>
       <p>The Executive Committee (EC) of SWECC consists of the attendees of this
         meeting (except that Laurie Werth was attending as a proxy for Linda
         Northrop). The EC is authorized to propose projects, such as the Software
         Engineering Body Of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Project. However, the sponsoring
         technical societies must approve all</p>
       <p> <br>
   projects.</p>
       <p>Key events of SWECC are an annual activity report, an annual budget
         projection, and an annual financial report. The EC will meet at least
         once per year, with two meetings currently scheduled for 1999. The next
         meeting will be held in Montreal, Canada, on July 13, 1999.</p>
       <p>A context diagram (slide 7 in Overview of SWECC ) relates several proposed
         projects of SWECC:</p>
       <p>&#8226; Guide to SWEBOK</p>
       <p>&#8226; SWE Model Curriculum</p>
       <p>&#8226; SWE Performance Norms</p>
       <p>&#8226; SWE Code of Ethics</p>
       <p>Each of these projects is to be coordinated with the others, and each
         of them will be of value to the software engineering community for such
         purposes as defining software engineering education programs, defining
         software engineering accreditation criteria, and defining what software
         engineering is to regulatory and legislative bodies. For example, the
         SWE Performance Norms project will be a primary input to a software engineering
         professional licensing examination. In the US, licensing is the province
         of individual State agencies, such as the Texas Board of Professional
         Engineers, but these agencies generally use a common set of examinations
         and they rely on technical societies to define the bodies of knowledge
         and performance norms that serve as a basis for defining the content
         of these examinations. In addition, they often require that applicants
         receive a degree in their discipline from an accredited program. Such
         programs will often follow a model curriculum posed by the technical
         societies.</p>
       <p>In the US, licensing of professionals varies from state to state, but
         most states use a similar process for any given discipline. For example,
         in order to be licensed as a professional engineer, each applicant must:</p>
       <p>1. obtain an appropriate bachelor's degree from an ABET accredited engineering
         program</p>
       <p>2. pass a Fundamentals of Engineering exam, consisting of a morning
         exam on general engineering topics, and an afternoon exam on a specialty
         area (such as software engineering)</p>
       <p>3. spend at least four years practicing their discipline under the supervision
         of a licensed engineer</p>
       <p>4. apply for a license, including submission of references</p>
       <p>5. pass a specialty area exam, such as safety-critical applications.</p>
       <p>In practice, most states use an exam prepared by the National Council
         of Examiners for</p>
       <p> <br>
   I&quot;ngiticering arid Surveying (NC'L~lf_.fS). These exams are prepared from
   a set of Performance Norms that are supplied by the appropriate technical societies.
   The American Society for Engineering, Education (ASEE) plays an important role
   in influencing NCEES to create exams.</p>
       <p>We decided that coordinating and cooperating with organizations like
         ASEE and NCEES was important to our effort.</p>
       <p>Leonard continued his presentation with some of the history of the &quot;Joint
         Committee&quot;, which began in 1993. (See slides in History of SWECC
         .) Much of this history is contained in the Final Report of Joint IEEE
         Computer Society and ACM Steering Committee for the Establishment of
         Software Engineering as a Profession.</p>
       <p>One of the lessons from the earlier effort was that it required more
         work than could be expected from volunteers only. That is, some support
         for funding projects, such as the body of knowledge project, would be
         needed.</p>
       <p>The earlier project produced a code of ethics that was approved by both
         the ACM and the Computer Society in 1998. It also started an effort to
         define an undergraduate curriculum. It was recommended that these efforts
         continue to their next logical steps. It was also recommended that the
         effort continue to cooperate with the Texas Board of Professional Engineers.</p>
       <p>3. Relationships between SWECC and others<br>
   We then proceeded to discuss the relationships between our effort and organizations
     such as ASEE, NCEES, etc. The objective was to identify liaisons between
     our activities and these other bodies. Although we started to identify liaisons,
     we did not complete this task. Leonard Tripp took an action item to prepare
     a list of liaisons by major categories for review by the EC.</p>
       <p>A question that arose during our discussions was the proliferation of &quot;certificate&quot; programs
         by various computer organizations and the need to provide guidance to
         the public on the role of these in comparison to college degrees, accreditation,
         and licensing. This discussion led to the concept of possible certification
         of specialties in software engineering. For example, in medicine one
         first obtains a license to practice medicine, but additional certifications
         to practice specialties (e.g., internal medicine, general surgery, orthopedics)
         can be granted by the appropriate medical board. Might safety-critical
         software be such a specialty deserving certification- Dennis Frailey
         took an action item to prepare a white paper on this subject for review.</p>
       <p>4. Plans<br>
   Our next topic was future plans for SWECC. Much of this discussion focussed
     on the difficulties of preparing a description of a body of knowledge, the
     mechanics of preparing licensing exams from such a description, and the relationship
     of a model curriculum to these efforts.</p>
       <p> <br>
   The body of knowledge (SWEBOK) project has solicited funding of $30,000 each
     from about ten organizations, most of which have been identified and roughly
     half of which have already agreed to participate and have initiated funding.
     These ten (which include government agencies, corporations in various economic
     sectors, and the two sponsors of SWECC - ACM and IEEE CS) are organizations
     for which the quality of software is a major concern. Their willingness to
     fund the project was an indication of the importance and relevance of the
     SWEBOK work to the software engineering community. The ten will serve as
     an Industry Advisory Board, which will provide a check on the relevance of
     the work.</p>
       <p>Once the body of knowledge is identified, a set of performance norms
         (sample questions) is prepared by volunteers. Such a project will be
         proposed for SWECC when it is appropriate. Although the volunteers are
         not paid, some modest living and travel expenses would be reimbursed.
         The future project will have to identify a funding source for these expenses.</p>
       <p>In addition to SWEBOK, a project that SWECC wants to start soon is the
         development of a model curriculum for software engineering. We spent
         some time discussing the objectives of such a project, and its relationships
         to other activities. It was clear that there are many possible software
         engineering curricula and, inspired by the &quot;curriculum 91&quot; model,
         we envision a number of alternatives resulting from this effort. However
         a clear objective was that the core content of software engineering,
         as defined by the SWEBOK project, would be contained in all such curricula
         and that the initial work in this area should include definition of at
         least one curriculum that would meet high technical standards that might
         qualify for accreditation and prepare students for licensing examinations,
         if and when these are established. Resolution 3 characterizes our initial
         charge to the group that will formally propose this project over the
         next several months.</p>
       <p>Dennis Frailey proposed two resolutions concerning the relationships
         between a model curriculum project and the SWEBOK project. (See Resolution
         1 &quot;Division of Responsibility between Body of Knowledge project
         and Education project&quot; and Resolution 2 &quot;Cooperative activity
         between SWEBOK and Education Projects&quot; at the end of these minutes.)
         Both resolutions were passed by the EC. A white paperdescribing the motivation
         for these resolutions is included as an attachment.</p>
       <p>Karl Reed proposed a resolution to the effect that any such model curriculum
         contain the core content of software engineering. (See Resolution 3 &quot;Undergraduate
         Curriculum Model&quot; , at the end of these minutes.) This resolution
         was passed by the EC.</p>
       <p>Finally, we discussed a document release process. It was agreed that
         the Chair and Vicechair of the EC would issue reports, minutes and general
         information about SWECC. Project deliverables, such as final reports,
         would be issued by the EC.</p>
       <p>5. Overview of Software Engineering Standards<br>
   Leonard Tripp gave an overview of software engineering standards activity as
     introductory material for the SWEBOK discussion. (See Overview of Software
     Engineering Standards.) Much of the SWEBOK effort has followed the same process
     as used by international standards organizations. The code of ethics effort,
     which culminated in a successful code of ethics after an extensive community
     review, also followed a similar process.<br>
       </p>
       <p>6. Report on SWEBOK Project<br>
   Leonard Tripp gave a report on the SWEBOK project. (See attachments Report
     SWEBOK Proicct and <br>
   Overview presentation given to Texas Board of Prof. Engineers .)<br>
   This project was started in December 1997 as a joint effort of the IEEE CS
   and the<br>
   University of Quebec at Montreal after the &quot;Joint Committee&quot;'s body
   of knowledge<br>
   project reached a point where it could not make further progress. As mentioned
   earlier,<br>
   the SWEBOK will be used by the model curriculum project and by the project
   that<br>
   identifies performance norms. It is also intended to be a resource of general
   use to many<br>
   others, such as practicing software engineers, students, and educators.</p>
       <p>The result of the first phase was a strawman version of a Guide to Software
         Engineering Body of Knowledge. An Industry Advisory Board reviewed this
         document and provided suggestions for the next phase of the project.
         One of the main requests was to collapse a large set of Knowledge Areas
         (KAs) down to a more reasonable number. The resulting baseline list has
         ten items:<br>
 &#8226; Software Requirements Analysis<br>
   Software Design</p>
       <p>Software Construction</p>
       <p>Software Testing</p>
       <p>Software Maintenance<br>
   Software Configuration Management</p>
       <p>Software Quality Analysis</p>
       <p>Software Engineering Management<br>
 &#8226; Software Engineering Infrastructure<br>
   Software Engineering Process<br>
   This list is subject to revision as a result of the work of the second phase
   of the SWEBOK effort. The Industrial Advisory Committee and the Panel of Experts
   are expected to influence the content of the final list. The EC discussed a
   number of areas where revisions might be made. Karl Reed raised the issue of
   the role of the history of software engineering in the proposed KAs. Mark Ardis
   took an action item to raise this issue to SWEBOK.</p>
       <p>In the next phase a KA specialist will be selected to draft each KA
         description (Version</p>
       <p> <br>
   0.1). Each description will include an overview of the area, a set of performance
     norms, and a list of references. Each description is expected to be about
     twenty pages long.</p>
       <p>A panel of experts will review the draft descriptions and make suggestions
         for the next version (Version 0.5). Teams with specific focus (e.g.,
         small industrial practice, large industrial practice, education, regulatory
         and government agencies, research, and others) will review that version.
         Each focus team will have a review captain who will be responsible for
         coordinating reviews across all KAs. The result of editing to accommodate
         those reviews will be Version 0.7. Finally, a large body of reviewers
         will participate in the final review phase. This group will be selected
         along demographic lines suggested by the members of the Industry Advisory
         Board. The last version of the KAs produced after this review will be
         Version 0.9, which will be made widely available for comment by the public.</p>
       <p>A key part of the SWEBOK project is that the process and all intermediate
         versions will be totally open for comment by the public. The overall
         schedule for SWEBOK is:</p>
       <p>&#8226; KA 0.1 -- 1 st Quarter 1999</p>
       <p>&#8226; KA 0.5 -- 2nd Quarter 1999</p>
       <p>&#8226; KA 0.7 -- 3rd Quarter 1999</p>
       <p>&#8226; KA 0.9 -- 4th Quarter 1999</p>
       <p>As mentioned earlier, funding for this project is provided by the Industry
         Advisor Board. With ten equal shares of $30,000 each, the project appears
         to be adequately funded.</p>
       <p>One of the concerns of EC members was to assure that there is a wide
         opportunity for participation by knowledgeable members of the technical
         societies. It was agreed that the panel of experts should include nominees
         from the technical societies. Karl Reed and Mark Ardis took an action
         item to draft a list of experts for the EC. In addition, the special
         review teams will include technical reviewers recommended in many cases
         by the technical societies.</p>
       <p>Since review plays an important role in the SWEBOK process, Karl Reed
         took an action item to find suitable means of motivating reviewers to
         participate. One mechanism for inviting reviewers will be to publicize
         a call in ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes and in the publication
         of IEEE-CS TCSE. Mark Ardis took an action item to place a call in a
         future issue of SEN.</p>
       <p>Another concern was the interaction of the education community with
         the SWEBOK effort. The resolutions brought forward by Dennis Frailey
         (see resolutions _1 and _2 ) address many of these concerns, but there
         may be other opportunities to cooperate. The educational representatives,
         Doris Carver and Laurie Werth (acting for Linda Northrop), took an action
         item to invite their respective organizations to participate in SWEBOK.</p>
       <p>The EC endorsed SWEBOK as a SWECC project.</p>
       <p> <br>
   7. Responsibility Areas<br>
   We reviewed the main projects and other significant activities of SWECC to
   assign each activity to at least one member of the EC. The following assignments
   were identified:<br>
   SWEBOK Leonard Tripp<br>
   Education Dennis Frailey<br>
   Publicity Karl Reed and Linda Northrop<br>
   Liaison with Standards Leonard Tripp<br>
   Liaison with National Bodies Leonard Tripp</p>
       <p>We expect other responsibilities to be identified after reviewing a
         more complete liaison list.</p>
       <p>8. Future Plans<br>
   The last items we discussed were the creation of a web page for SWECC, and
     future meetings.</p>
       <p>Both technical societies have begun planning for the web page. A target
         date of February 15 has been set for initial deployment. The first version
         will have an introduction, a document register, and a brief description
         of related activities. Later versions will include a history of activity
         and a possible chat room.</p>
       <p>A related issue of visibility is the production of letterhead and business
         cards for SWECC. We noted an action item for this but failed to assign
         it.</p>
       <p>We agreed to meet by teleconference during the week of April 12, 1999,
         probably on the 13th or 14th. We also acknowledged that the next face-to-face
         meeting would be in Montreal on July 13, 1999.</p>
       <p>9. Resolutions Passed by SWECC EC<br>
   Resolution 1: Division of Responsibility between Body of Knowledge project
     and Education project<br>
   Sponsor: Dennis J. Frailey</p>
       <p>The body of knowledge project and the education project shall divide
         responsibilities for identifying the body of knowledge as follows:</p>
       <p>&#8226; The BOK Project shall be responsible for the identifying the
         knowledge areas that are unique to software engineers and, within each
         knowledge area, identifying and providing reference material to definitive
         sources on the topics that are essential to a software engineer.</p>
       <p> <br>
 &#8226; The BOK Project shall be responsible for identifying other disciplines
 that contain knowledge areas that are important for a software engineer.</p>
       <p>&#8226; The BOK Project and the Education project shall be jointly responsible
         for identifying those knowledge areas within other disciplines (computer
         science, computer engineering, math, science, etc.) that are necessary
         for a software engineer.</p>
       <p>&#8226; The Education Project shall be responsible for identifying and
         providing authoritative references for the topics within each knowledge
         area from &quot;other&quot; disciplines that are necessary for software
         engineers.</p>
       <p>Resolution 2: Cooperative activity between SWEBOK and Education Projects<br>
   Sponsor: Dennis J. Frailey</p>
       <p>Each project shall have at least one annual review of its progress,
         to which the other project(s) and SWECC shall be invited to send representatives.
         Furthermore, for those responsibilities that are joint, the projects
         shall plan and budget for appropriate joint activities and shall keep
         SWECC and the other projects informed of these.</p>
       <p>Resolution 3: Undergraduate Curriculum Model</p>
       <p>Sponsor: Karl Reed</p>
       <p>The undergraduate curriculum model should contain the core content of
         the software engineering field. At a minimum, a program that implements
         the model should meet accreditation standards, and a student who graduates
         from the program should be prepared to pass a fundamentals of software
         engineering licensing exam.</p>
