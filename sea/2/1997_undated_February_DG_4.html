       <p>Keith, <br>
       (February when reformatting things for the ACM)
       <p> Simon and I had a productive morning. What do you think of the following.<br>
         1. Structure<br>
   Code starts with a preamble- yet to be worked out- probably when finished with
   rest of code.</p>
       <p> Change Rules to Principles.; structure the code around the seven key
         word Principles. Following each principle is a list of clauses(obligations,aspirations,expansions)
     to that principle. The clauses within the principle are clustered by level-
     level 1 general human ethics,
   level 2
   generic professional obligation, level 3 specific SE obligation. Look<br>
   at what we suggest for Rule 1 as an example of this. The balance of elements
   at each level will differ from Principle to Principle depending on the nature
   of the Principle. </p>
       <p>Since the Principles are key to the structure we will need to carefully
         define them</p>
       <p>We see Principle1 Product, as starting with level 2-3 obligations that
         lead to useful and acceptable software then it contains level 1-2 things
         the SE should aspire toward to reach the goal of a quality product.</p>
       <p>A list justifying the changes we are suggesting for the first two Principles
         is listed below. The changes are identified by a number in parenthesis
         (number). Purely grammatical changes are not identified.<br>
         =======================================================<br>
         ========<br>
   CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS v1.a February 19967</p>
       <p>INTRODUCTION<br>
         &lt; 
         SKIP&gt;</p>
       <p>(1) Principle 1: PRODUCT. Software engineers shall, insofar as possible,
         assure that the software on which they work is useful (2) and of acceptable
         quality to the public, the employer, the (3) client, and the user, completed
         on time and at reasonable cost, and free of (?)significant error. In
         particular,
         software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
       <p> 1.01. (4) Ensure that specifications for software on which they work
         have been (5) well documented, satisfy the user's requirements, and have
         the customer's approval.<br>
   1.02. (6) Strive to understand fully the specifications for software on which
   they work.<br>
   1.03. (4) Ensure that they are qualified, by education (7) or experience, for
   any project on which they work (8) or propose to work.<br>
   1.04. (4) Ensure proper goals and objectives for any project on which they
   work.<br>
   1.05 (4) Ensure (9) appropriate development methodology on any project on which
   they work (8) or propose to work.<br>
   1.06. (4) Ensure (9) good management on any project on which they work, including
   (9) effective procedures for control of quality and risk.<br>
   1.07. (4) Ensure (9) accurate estimates of cost, schedule, personnel, and outcome
   on any project on which they work (8)or propose to work.<br>
   1.08. (4) Ensure adequate documentation on any project on which they work,
   including a log of problems discovered and solutions adopted.<br>
   1.09. (4)Ensure (9) adequate testing, debugging, and review of software and
   related documents on which they work.<br>
   1.10. (10) Aspire to develop software and related documents that respect the
   privacy of those who will be subject to that software.<br>
   1.11 (10) Aspire to only use accurate data derived from legal sources and use
   only in ways properly authorized.<br>
   1.12. (10) Aspire to identify define and address ethical, economic, cultural,
   legal, and environmental issues.<br>
   1.13. Promote maximum (11) quality and minimum cost to the employer, the (3)
   client, the user, and the public.<br>
   1.14. (10) Aspire to use standard practices, departing from these only when
   technically justified.</p>
       <p><br>
         Rule 2: PUBLIC. Software engineers shall, in their professional role,
           act only in ways consistent with the public safety, health and welfare.
           In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
       <p> 2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons (12) or authorities any (13)
         actual or potential danger that the software or related documents on
         which they work (14) or are aware of may pose to the user, a third party,
         or
         the environment.<br>
   2.02. Approve software only if they have a well-(15)founded belief that it
   is<br>
   safe, meets specifications, and has passed all appropriate tests,(16) and does
   not deminish quality of life or harm the environment..<br>
   2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared under their supervision
   (17) or within their areas of competence.<br>
   2.04. Cooperate in efforts to address matters of grave public concern in software
   or related documents.<br>
   2.05. Be fair and truthful in all (19) statements, particularly public ones,
   concerning software or related documents.<br>
   2.06. Not put self-interest, the interest of an employer, the interest of a
   client (3), or the interest of the user ahead of the public's interest.<br>
   2.07. Accept full responsibility for their own work.</p>
       <p>Rule 3: JUDGMENT. Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, protect
         both the independence of their professional judgment and their reputation
         for such judgment. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
         ==================================<br>
         We think one way to avoid the political difficulty of responding to particular
         criticisms and questions is to just make these modification saying they
         take into
         account the comprehensive and brilliant comments on the previous
         draft.</p>
       <p><br>
         Modifications<br>
         1. Change Rule to Principle since not really a single rule but statement
         embodies a set of activities. This change lessens the misreading of the
         code as
         a checklist,.</p>
       <p>2. This introduces professional commitment to quality at an early level
         and helps to answer the &quot;who is to say&quot; question.</p>
       <p>3. Replace all uses of word 'customer with word 'client'. 'Client' is
         less domain specific word. In a maintenance situation the client is the
         person who delivered the task to you. Client could also be a student
         or the professional
   receiving services from the professional organization. This change introduces
   some consistency missing from later clauses. &quot;Client&quot; is
   a person using the services of X.</p>
       <p>?. We felt uncomfortable with the phrase 'significant error'. It may
         be used as an escape clause- 'I had lots of errors but didn't think any
         of them significant'. We need a crisp replacement phrase here like 'mission
         critical'<br>
 &lt;-yuck. Any ideas here???</p>
       <p>4. Replace 'assure&quot; with &quot;ensure&quot;. 'Ensure' is less legal
         than 'assure' which carries a formal guarantee and legal connotation
         (according to the OED); whilst 'ensure' means to strive to make a thing
         happen and no formal guarantee implied. This change is made for most
         future occurrences of 'assure'. <br>
   .<br>
   5. Replace 'in writing' with more generic 'well documented' to allow for multimedia
   capture of specifications. </p>
       <p>6. Replace 'assure' with 'Strive to'; used a purely aspirational term
         here to placate those who appeal to impossibility of precise specs. It
         is also consistent with Ed's response to the steering committee.</p>
       <p>7. Change ' and' to 'or' in 1.03 to include those who have good technical
         knowledge and to make clear that 'qualified by education' does not imply
         paper
         qualification. </p>
       <p>8. Add DL's clause to 103.105, and 107 'or propose to work' because
         this encourages a professionals commitment to develop the requisite skills
         prior to taking on new responsibilities.</p>
       <p>9. Replace 'proper' in several clauses with a less vague phrase. For
         example in this clause there are technical answers to the question 'which
         methods are appropriate?'</p>
       <p>Clause 1.01-1.09 are more technical than 1.10-1.14. It is in these clauses
         where we started to more emphatically introduce commitments to society
         embodied in product development.</p>
       <p>10 Used more aspirational and intentional phrase for these level 1 type
         obligations in 1.10-1.14</p>
       <p>11 Replace productivity with quality.</p>
       <p>Principle 2</p>
       <p>12 Insert word authorities because what someone who can remedy the problem.</p>
       <p>13 Insert 'actual or potential' because if only respond to actual dangers
         then one does not have an obligation to address potential dangers.</p>
       <p>14 Added 'or are aware of' because as stated, you only have obligations
         to report dangers of projects you are working on. Someone next to you
         can be working on a dangerous project and there is no stated obligation
         to address the problem.
   Both ACM and IEEE code require the reporting of dangers 'you are
   aware of'. </p>
       <p>15 Replace well-documented with well-founded.</p>
       <p>16. Added specific commitments to protect the public and the ability
         to use the approval process to do it.</p>
       <p>17. Replace 'and' with 'or' to allow for approvals where the SE is not
         in a supervisory role. One commentator suggested that this clause might
         better belong under Principle 3. What do you think. </p>
       <p>18. Restructure this statement to address a public issue. As stated
         this clause was strictly product related. We were thinking about making
         change 18 and also moving the clause as it stood to follow clause 1.09
         -following testing is the clause to cooperate in efforts
   to correct problems in software and related documents.</p>
       <p>19. The clause as it stood indicated that it was ok to lie in non public
         statements.</p>
       <p>We good tired and I have to reformat the table one more time- <br>
         Are we having fun yet???</p>
       <p>Looking forward to your responses.</p>
       <p>cheers,<br>
         don<br>
