                   <p>Sorry I spelled your name wrong on the first review. I think 
 
                     the first commentator got to me a little; heard those responses 
 
                     too many times in my life. It seems the ethics product has 
 
                     developed some heat in the total effort.</p>
 
                   <p> I got four e-mails from Don Gotterbarn but I will get to 
 
                     them after sending you this reply.</p>

                      Do you think you may address the points discussed below?</p>
 
                   <p> -- Felipe</p>
 
                   <p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
 
                   <p>Felipe,</p>
 
                   <p> I share xx's general concern that this is fine in theory 
 
                     but hard to apply. I realize that codes of ethics should be 
 
                     idealistic, but they also must be credible -- that is, practitioners 
 
                     should be able to see how the code shapes their work. Another 
 
                     way of saying this is that this draft seems a little naive. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>If I remember correctly, there was a debate in Ethics between 
 
                     Absolute and Relative but not idealistic and practical. The 
 
                     code doesn't shape work but guides SEs in areas of concern. 
 
                     I don't understand the &quot;naive&quot;, aren't we advocating 
 
                     all of the items in the code? </p>
 
                   <p>The Code doesn't discriminate in intensity, even though some 
 
                     of the points are pretty close to absolute and others are 
 
                     currently viewed by many as good practice. I'd sign up to 
 
                     expecting an SE to refuse to work on a project that is blatently 
 
                     unsafe or fraudulent.</p>
 
                   <p> However, deviations from this committee's view of good process 
 
                     doesn't fall in this category, and the Code doesn't distinguish. 
 
                     For example, for me &quot;thou-shalt-absolutely&quot;s include 
 
                     2.01, 2.03 (but see note), 2.07, 4.04, 4.08, 4.09 whereas 
 
                     &quot;you should make a good-faith attempt to&quot; include 
 
                     1.01, 1.05, 4.06, 5.06, 5.11.</p>
 
                   <p> I have never seen intensity associated with Ethics; guidelines 
 
                     are statements to help judgment. If a project is &quot;blatantly&quot; 
 
                     something then I don't need a code; the code is for the gray 
 
                     areas. </p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     There are some other points that require each software engineer 
 
                     to control things over which he/she has no control. Naturally 
 
                     the SE should try to achieve all this, by working within the 
 
                     company if not directly. But holding individual SEs responsible 
 
                     for things outside their control is another place where the 
 
                     degree of responsibility 
 
                     and consequence isn't clear: 1.01, 1.06, 1.07, 1.09, 1.12, 
 
                     3.04, 4.02, 6.06, 6.10 </p>
 
                   <p>The question is, Where does the responsibility begin? It 
 
                     must start at the SE Professional. I think too much &quot;Thou 
 
                     shall not&quot; or Thou shall&quot; is being read into the 
 
                     Codes Items. They are guide lines. </p>
 
                   <p>There are some points at which mechanism creeps in. The Code 
 
                     should, I think, state the objective and leave implementation 
 
                     to the best judgement of the engineer. (This is the usual 
 
                     rule about specifications.) 
 
                     Examples: 1.01 (the new one about written specs, added between 
 
                     Aug 8 and Sep 30), 2.02 (the &quot;well-documented&quot; part), 
 
                     2.03 (the &quot;affix signature&quot; part), 5.13, 6.02 (the 
 
                     only way I can understand this one is as an implementation 
 
                     of something I haven't figured out yet). I do not see the 
 
                     &quot;mechanism&quot;. </p>
 
                   <p>We did not lay out steps but areas that the SE should be 
 
                     aware of. We tried to put them in a SE logical order which 
 
                     might give it an allusion of steps. The items are not objectives 
 
                     but guidelines for judgments.</p>
 
                   <p> A particular problem area is international business. Even 
 
                     if the Code is intended for US practice, many US firms operate 
 
                     internationally. 3.02 and 3.03 (on bribes, kickbacks, etc) 
 
                     don't really address the very gray situation in some countries. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>For example, I understand that in some countries customs 
 
                     officials are not supposed to take payments (by whatever name), 
 
                     but the computation that yields their salaries assumes they 
 
                     *are* receiving such payments. This is an area that goes back 
 
                     to Ethics being absolute or relative.</p>
 
                   <p>I personally have not heard of a system using bribes, kickbacks, 
 
                     etc. that has worked. I have heard of systems that removed 
 
                     them and had better results. Anyway, this area was adapted 
 
                     from the PE Code, most of those people do business internationally. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p> There are also omissions in the handling of intellectual 
 
                     property. Piracy appears in 4.04, confidentiality and public 
 
                     domain IP are used inconsistently in 4.05, copyright but not 
 
                     patent appears as part of a list in 4.07, trade secret and 
 
                     nondisclosure are mentioned nowhere at all (though 4.05 was 
 
                     probably intended to address them), there's also nothing about 
 
                     export restriction, and what's there about privacy is politically 
 
                     loaded. &quot;Patent&quot; will be added to 4.07. If &quot;export 
 
                     restriction&quot; is desirable  
 
                     please write the statement and where it should be placed.</p>
 
                   <p> I am not sure it fits here. As for privacy being politically 
 
                     loaded, maybe, but from an ethical point of view we should 
 
                     be very aware of these conditions. On the whole, I think the 
 
                     document would be more likely to be read if it were shorter, 
 
                     crisper, and more realistic.</p>
 
                   <p> A supplementary document could work through examples in 
 
                     a little more detail than the 2-liners that constitute most 
 
                     of this document. This a matter of style. We decided on the 
 
                     PE Code model to list some of the detail items associated 
 
                     with a rule. </p>
 
                   <p> Specific comments: 
 
                      
 
                     Introduction:</p>
 
                   <p> - &quot;to assure ... used for good&quot; makes me uneasy 
 
                     (who gets to decide  
 
                     what's &quot;good&quot;?)</p>
 
                   <p> Ethics is a set of principles or values that guide our judgments. 
 
                     - The last sentence about the second-order bullets being incomplete 
 
                      
 
                     sets of examples is pretty obscure. 
 
                     General disclaimer saying we cannot give all instances of 
 
                     a rule in ethics. 
 
                      
 
                     Rule 1</p>
 
                   <blockquote> 
 
                     <p> - 1.04: Who on earth gets to decide whether goals are 
 
                       &quot;proper&quot;? Ethics is a set of principles or values 
 
                       that guide our judgments.</p>
 
                     <p> - 1.10: software/documentation seems mismatched to privacy. 
 
                       Privacy probably belongs under Rule 2 anyhow. Further, there's 
 
                       a big difference in the privacy arena between what's legal 
 
                       in the US and what many people think is &quot;proper&quot;. 
 
                       There is a difference, something legal could be unethical. 
 
                       The items are  
 
                       guidelines for judgments.</p>
 
                     <p> - 1.13: What if the client wants quality of product (==&gt; 
 
                       not minimum price) and quality of life for SEs and programmers 
 
                       (==&gt; not maximum productivity)? The client should then 
 
                       have a code or mission; I am not sure these fall under the 
 
                       SEs control. Anyway these do not seem to me to be mutually 
 
                       exclusive.</p>
 
                     <p> - 1.14: It is not the case that &quot;fad&quot; is the 
 
                       same thing as &quot;departure 
 
                       from standard practice&quot;. In fact, there's a good case 
 
                       that some standard practices ARE fads. That is so true. 
 
                        
 
                       A great deal of resources are applied because it is the 
 
                       latest fad , not because it fits the project and if we are 
 
                       luckily we end up where we started. As professionals this

                     <p> - 2.03 Presumably this means engineering documents about 
 
                       the product, not other documents the SE may sign at various 
 
                       times? 
 
                       Yes it refers to Rule 2.</p>
 
                     <p> - 2.07 Wouldn't it be nice to have a level of practice 
 
                       that allowed this? As professionals we should try hard to 
 
                       get there; we have too much finger pointing. </p>

                     <p> - 3.05, 3.06 Are these acts always and without exception 
 
                       unethical? <br>I've been a member of a number of groups in which 
 
                       potential conflicts were managed other than by complete 
 
                       exclusion. Indeed, 3.07 offers an alternative, thereby creating 
 
                       disagreement among 3.05, 3.06, and 3.07. I am not sure I 
 
                       understand your experiences but 3.05 and 3.06 give a guideline 
 
                       for these conditions and 3.07 gives an alternative if 3.05/3.06 
 
                       can not be applied. </p>

                     <p> - 4.01 I agree with Dennis. I think competency is quite 
 
                       recognizable and since you agree with the first reviewer. 
 
                       The commentator paints a very bleak picture of our industry.</p>
 
                     <p> - 4.05 Good sentiment, but imprecise statement. <br>There 
 
                       are many degrees of confidentiality to observe. In particular, 
 
                       copyright material is widely availablle in books but not 
 
                       public domain. 
 
                       Do you really mean an SE should say &quot;I found the algorithm 
 
                       in a standard textbook but must keep it confidential?&quot; 
 
                       That's what this point says. </p>
 
                     <p>First, I haven't seen a standard textbook in a while. Shouldn't 
 
                       it be the responsibility of the SE to bring your example 
 
                       to light? If I use an algorithm for gains what is the ethical 
 
                       thing to do?</p>
 
                     <p> - 4.07 Why just *copyright* laws? Why not *all* laws? 
 
                       We have 5.10. I have seen &quot;Obey all Laws&quot; in ethics 
 
                       documents but find it hard to put general legal factors 
 
                       in ethics for two reasons. To a degree ethics transcends 
 
                       legal and if a concept is legal doesn't necessarily imply 
 
                       ethical.

                       5.08 refers to working with other SEs where as 2.05 is more

                     <p>- 6.02 Is it the intention of the Code to eliminate anonymous 
 
                       refereeing? That wouldn't be consistent with 5.13. More 
 
                       seiously, engineers review engineering artifacts regularly. 
 
                     </p>
 
                     <p>As far as I know, reviewers of public artifacts don't check 
 
                       in first. This would preclude product reviews undertaken 
 
                       without prior warning to the developer; it would impede 
 
                       product selection in the same way. What is this really trying 
 
                       to say? 6.02 is not even related to 5.13.</p>
 
                     <p> Shouldn't a professional be advised that their work is 
 
                       being reviewed? The item doesn't refer to public artifacts. 
 
                       I must be missing the point of anonymous refereeing or without 
 
                       prior warning since I never deal with them. Is it to trap 
 
                       someone? What happened to walkthroughs?</p>
