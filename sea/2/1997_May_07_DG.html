                   <p align="left"> 9.a. IEEE Draft Software Engineering Code of 
 
                     Ethics (http://computer.org/tab/seprof/code.htm)</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The effort of the IEEE task force in generating 
 
                     this code was very much appreciated. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">A number of rather direct, quite general 
 
                     observations were first made by the group: </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">1. the code needs to have its items prioritized 
 
                     in a more evident manner. Items need `stacking'; </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">2. the role of the individual as distinct 
 
                     from the role of the organization should be more clearly delineated; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">3. there are conflicts among some of the 
 
                     items included in the code;</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">4. the code represents idealism; then there 
 
                     is realism, the real world; </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">5. many of the issues raised are not specific 
 
                     to software engineering; </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">6. would some of the issues be more easily 
 
                     incorporated under a code of business ethics? </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">7. are some of the issues raised actually 
 
                     about the management of large projects?</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">8. the code is really a set of guidance notes;</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">9.is any kind of enforcement to be offered/imposed? 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">10. some of the names included in the task 
 
                     force appear to be relatively `new' names to the field of 
 
                     ethics.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Going sequentially through the text, the 
 
                     following remarks are offered: </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">1. Princ. 1: The goals are too high to be 
 
                     achieved! What is then the meaning of such a statement? Some 
 
                     paragraphs have nothing to see with ethics (1.01 `well documented'; 
 
                     1.05 `ensure appropriate methodology', ...) </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">2. Princ. 2: In our view, the emphasis must 
 
                     be put on `disclose the potential danger'. About 2.06, one 
 
                     could wonder if it is feasible when we know that software 
 
                     always contains errors! We also insist on the difficulty of 
 
                     locating the responsibilities in software development </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">3. Princ. 3: Difficult to implement</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">4. Princ. 4: `consistent with the public 
 
                     health, ...': does it mean that Princ. 4 is ranked over Princ. 
 
                     3 (see `always act ...')? Where would you include whistle-blowing? 
 
                     In 4.07? Wouldn't it be better to consider it in a general 
 
                     clause?</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">5. Princ. 5: Curiously most of the statements 
 
                     are related to software engineers in their position towards 
 
                     their subordinates more than to themselves as leaders. It 
 
                     looks like the management (title of Princ. 5) would have the 
 
                     task of enforcing the code! 5.07 (`fair remuneration') may 
 
                     smell as `bribe is allowed in certain limits'. Is it necessary 
 
                     to mention something which is normally regulated by the market? 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">6. Princ. 7: Being so detailed, why not mention 
 
                     the share of work and responsibility with women. Would it 
 
                     be `gender discrepancy'? But, more precisely, SIG9.2.2 would 
 
                     suggest to insist on specific software engineering aspects 
 
                     and not on too general matters. How to interpret 7.03 when 
 
                     thinking about Microsoft Windows 95 unreliability, or other 
 
                     well known products? 7.07 is also a bit wishful thinking when 
 
                     compared to practice! </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">7. Princ. 8: There is a real confusion between 
 
                     what must appear as a duty (updating and deepening their knowledge 
 
                     and competence) and what is linked to the code. 8.05 needs 
 
                     explanation (`the law governing the software'???). The title 
 
                     `Self' is meaningless: SIG9.2.2 thinks that `education' would 
 
                     be more appropriate and needs to be stressed as a principle 
 
                     as such, including the present Princ. 8.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Concluding remarks:</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">1. It would be better to distinguish the 
 
                     statements which belong to `Business Ethics in general' and 
 
                     those which are specific to software engineering as such. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">2. As many codes of this kind, the statements 
 
                     are individualistic, whereas software engineering is more 
 
                     and more a collective task, a work of teams where most of 
 
                     the problems are management problems. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">3. Such a `code' is too consensual and doesn't 
 
                     recognize the conflicting world in which we evolve. It is 
 
                     needed to recognize the conflicts of interests. For instance, 
 
                     nothing is said about the problem of delocalization of software 
 
                     engineering, whereas it is a real ethical question of justice. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">4. Such a `code' would be better named &quot;Guidance 
 
                     notes&quot;, and surely &quot;Code of practice&quot; better 
 
                     than &quot;Code of ethics&quot; (many statements have nothing 
 
                     to see with ethics; present title is misguiding).</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">5. In terms of structure, the three levels 
 
                     as mentioned in the Preamble must appear more clearly in the 
 
                     presentation. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Jacques Berleur asked members of the SIG 
 
                     to send him any further comments on the code. He offered to 
 
                     be in contact with Don Gotterbarn and forward to him our observations.
