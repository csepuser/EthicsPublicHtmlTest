                   <p>CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS</p>
                   <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
 
                   <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, 
 
                     industry, government, medicine, entertainment, and much of 
 
                     ordinary life. Because the utility of computers depends in 
 
                     large part on the instructions written for them, those who 
 
                     design, develop, and test software have enormous opportunities 
 
                     both to do good and to cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, 
 
                     that this power will be used for good, software engineers 
 
                     commit themselves to making the design, development, and testing 
 
                     of software a distinct, useful, and respected profession. 
 
                     In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall 
 
                     adhere to the following standards of conduct.</p>
 
                   <p>1. PRODUCT. Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, 
 
                     assure that the software on which they work is useful to public, 
 
                     employer, and user, completed on time and at reasonable cost, 
 
                     and free of significant error. In particular, software engineers 
 
                     shall, as appropriate: </p>
 
                   <p>1.01. Assure proper goals and objectives for any project 
 
                     on which they work. </p>
 
                   <p>1.02. Assure proper development methodology on any project

                   <p>1.06. Assure proper privacy, accuracy, property, access,

                   <p>1.07. Assure proper estimates of cost, schedule, personnel, 
 
                     and outcome on project on the work. </p>
 
                   <p>1.08. Assure specifications are fully understood. (by whom?) 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.09. Assure environmental issues addressed.(?) </p>
 
                   <p>1.10. Promote maximum productivity and minimum cost to employer, 
 
                     user, and public. </p>
