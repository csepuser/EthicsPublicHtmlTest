       <p>1 The Communications Decency Act
       <p>On February 1, 1996, Congress passed the Senator Exon's
                     Communications Decency Act (CDA) as a part of the Telecommunications
                     Act of 1996. The ACLU announced on February 7, 1996, that
                     it would file suit to challenge the constitutionality of
                     the CDA (CPSR is a named plaintiff in this suit). The ACLU
                     is utilizing section 561 of the Telecommunications Act which
                     provides for expedited judicial review of constitutional
                     challenges. One week later, U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter
                     of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania issued a temporary
                     restraining order, enjoining enforcement of only a portion
                     of the Communications Decency Act, &sect; 223(a)(1)(B). The
                     provision enjoined concerns indecency transmitted over &quot;telecommunication
                     devices&quot; other than &quot;interactive computer networks.&quot; A
                     permanent injunction hearing will take place in the near
                     future. See ACLUPress Release (February 15, 1996).</p>
                   <p>The following is a summary of the requirements and liabilities
                     for &quot;interactive computer networks&quot; under the CDA.
                     This analysis assumes the constitutionality of the Act and
                     makes no comments on its constitutional flaws. For an analysis
                     of the constitutionality of the CDA, see plaintiff's brief
                     in ACLU v. Reno.</p>
                   <p>1.1 Liability and Responsibility Under the CDA</p>
                   <p>The CDA amended 47 USC &sect; 223, which regulates obscene
                     and harassing telephone calls. Pursuant to the CDA, it is
                     illegal to knowingly use an &quot;interactive computer service&quot; to
                     send to or display in a manner available to a person under
                     18 years of age
                   <p> any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other
                     communication that, in context, depicts or describes, in
                     terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
                     standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless
                     of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated
                     the communication.
                   <p>&sect; 223(d)(1). The conferees intended to incorporate
                     into the final version of the CDA the definition of &quot;indecency&quot; from
                     FCC v. Pacifica, and apply this definition to &quot;interactive
                     computer networks.&quot;<br>
   Violators would be liable for each act of posting or sending the offensive
   material and not each act of accessing or downloading. It is the intent of
   the Congressional conferees that the CDA punish content providers and not those
   accessing the content. The CDA could be applied to computer networks as small
   as a two computer LAN.</p>
                   <p>Critics point out that material posted in the open environment
                     of the Internet is available to all users in all communities.
                     An individual posting data will be liable for violations
                     of the CDA wherever that data offends community standards.
                     Therefore, the community which is most easily offended will
                     dictate what material can be posted. Anyone anywhere on the
                     network that violates the standards of the most conservative
                     and restrictive community with access to that network is
                     subject to liability pursuant to the CDA. Thus, all material
                     an individual considers posting must be evaluated by &quot;the
                     lowest common denominator,&quot; the most conservative and
                     restrictive standards applicable. Service providers could
                     be subject to liability if they knowingly permit their telecommunications
                     facilities to be used in a manner that violates the CDA. &sect; 223(d)(2).
                     Service providers would appear to have the responsibility
                     of monitoring all activity that occurs on their service.
                     Violations of &sect; 223 can result in fines under title
                     18 of the United States Code and two years in prison. &sect;<br>
   223(d).</p>
                   <p>1.2 Defenses Provided Under the CDA</p>
                   <p>1.2.1 Access Provider Defense</p>
                   <p>Section 223(e)(1) provides a defense for service providers
                     solely providing access to materials not under their control.
                     Chris McLean of Senator Exon's office stated that this means,
                     for example, that America Online would not be liable for
                     providing to a minor mere access to the Hustler Magazine
                     World Wide Web site on the Internet. This broad defense substantially
                     limits the reach of the CDA. The Internet is a network of
                     thousands of &quot;independent&quot; computer networks. A
                     service provider is generally providing only mere access
                     to the other computers on the Internet. Since Hustler is
                     on a separate computer, a service provider would not be held
                     liable for a violation of the CDA if minors access the Hustler
                     site via the service provider where the provider is providing &quot;mere
                     access to material not under its control.&quot; As long as
                     a service provider is only providing an Internet connection,
                     minors could download every piece of offensive material from
                     every other computer on the Internet without the service
                     provider incurring liability. This analysis changes, of course,
                     if the service provider offers improved services beyond &quot;mere
                     access,&quot; which might include search engines, directories,
                     and other devices assisting users to gain access to the offensive
                     material.</p>
                   <p>1.2.2 Good Faith Defenses</p>
                   <p>1.2.2.1 Defense Against Liability Under CDA</p>
                   <p>Section 223(e)(5) provides the good faith defense: it is
                     a defense if an individual makes a &quot;good faith, reasonable,
                     effective, and appropriate&quot; effort to restrict the access
                     of minors to offensive material. These terms will be difficult
                     to define. Good faith efforts may include </p>
                   <p> systematically and periodically reviewing all material
                     on a server; requiring all subscribers to sign contracts
                     agreeing not to &quot;send&quot; or &quot;display&quot; offensive
                     material; blocking access to certain USENET groups; implementing
                     or making available filtering software which restricts the
                     access of minors to certain Internet sites (See &sect; 230(b)(3)
                     (encouraging the development of filtering software)); restricting
                     access to internet sites through use of PINS, passwords,
                     or credit card numbers; placing warning notices on material
                     that might be considered of an adult nature; setting up special
                     accounts for minors with restricted Internet access; and
                     refusing to sell accounts to minors. </p>
                   <p>These &quot;efforts&quot; raise several concerns. </p>
                   <p> Some of the methods of implementing the &quot;good faith&quot; defense
                     may lead to legal violations, including violations of privacy
                     and First Amendment rights. <br>
   Such efforts may fit under the definition of one term but not under another
   term of the defense. In other words, an effort may be reasonable but far from
   effective. Any effort to monitor the content of e?mail may run afoul of the
   Electronic Communications Privacy Act. 18 USC &sect; 2510. </p>
                   <p>Finally, this defense must be considered in light of the &quot;mere
                     access&quot; defense; where the service provider is providing &quot;mere
                     access,&quot; the provider would appear to be under no duty
                     to make any efforts to block access to material not under
                     its control.</p>
                   <p>1.2.2.2 Good Faith Defense Against Other Liability: The
                     Stratton Defense</p>
                   <p>As a corollary to &sect; 223(e)(5) and in order to overrule
                     the controversial holding in Stratton?Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy, &sect; 223(f)(1)
                     states that no individual who makes a good faith effort to
                     restrict the access of minors to offensive material shall
                     be subject to civil or other liability on account of that
                     effort. Section 230(c)(1) also states that interactive computer
                     services are not republishers of the data transmitted over
                     their computers, protecting service providers from defamation
                     claims. In Stratton, Prodigy, which held itself out as child
                     safe by monitoring and censoring offensive material, was
                     found liable for failing to censor defamatory material posted
                     by a third party. The Judge in Stratton concluded that the
                     act of monitoring its service in order to protect children
                     had made Prodigy a &quot;republisher&quot; of the defamatory
                     material. The CDA good faith defense ensures that service
                     providers are not exposed to such liability when they seek
                     to make their services safe for children.</p>
                   <p>This defense, however, may arguably provide a service provider
                     with unintended protection. By overruling Stratton, Congress
                     intended to protect service providers from liability for
                     an omission (the failure to stop defamatory remarks). Congress,
                     however, also granted protection for<br>
   affirmative acts. Where, for instance, the service provider has violated the
   privacy rights of a user, an affirmative act on the part of the service provider,
   the service provider may be protected from liability. Thus service providers
   may now have the ability to break the law with impunity in the name of restricting
   access to offensive material.</p>
                   <p>1.2.3 Vicarious Liability Defense</p>
                   <p>The third defense, &sect; 223(e)(4) removes some of the
                     risk of vicarious liability to employers for activities of
                     their employees. Employers could be liable for the conduct
                     of their employees, acting within the scope of their employment,
                     when the employer authorizes, ratifies, or recklessly disregards
                     such conduct. The CDA thereby limits common law vicarious
                     liability.</p>
                   <p>1.3 Government Jurisdiction Over the Internet</p>
                   <p>Section 223(e)(6) states that the FCC &quot;may describe
                     measures which are reasonable, effective, and appropriate
                     to restrict access to prohibited communications.&quot; This
                     authority for jurisdiction over the &quot;interactive computer
                     networks&quot; is to be narrowly construed and the FCC otherwise
                     has no role in enforcing of the CDA. The Telecommunications
                     Bill further states that it is the policy of the Federal
                     Government &quot;to preserve the vibrant and competitive
                     free market that presently exists for the Internet and other
                     interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State
                     regulation.&quot;<br>
   Sec. 230(b)(2). Thus, Congress gave the FCC virtually no jurisdiction over
   online medium. Also, the CDA preempts state legislation, but only with respect
   to commercial entities, nonprofit libraries, or institutions of higher learning. &sect; 223(f)(2).</p>
                   <p>2 The Hyde Amendment</p>
                   <p>In the midst of the confusion surrounding the inclusion
                     of the Manager's Amendment in the House's version of the
                     Telecommunications Bill, Congressman Hyde slipped a surprise
                     through the back door. Entitled &quot;Clarification of Current
                     Laws Regarding Communication of Obscene Materials Through
                     the Use of Computers,&quot; Sec. 507 of the Telecommunications
                     Act expands the reach of the federal obscenity laws to cover &quot;interactive
                     computer services.&quot; See 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1462 as amended;
                     18 U.S.C. &sect; 1465 as amended.</p>
                   <p>The amendment of &sect; 1462 has received substantial attention.
                     According to 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1462(c), it would be illegal
                     to transmit any material over online communications concerning
                     abortion. See Congressional Record (comments by Representative
                     Hyde on restriction of abortion communications). According
                     to the ACLU, DOJ has determined that this particular amendment
                     is not worth defending and has conceded that it violates
                     the First Amendment. At the time of the writing of this document,
                     DOJ had not provided the ACLU with a written statement confirming
                     this position. See ACLU Press Release (February 15, 1996).</p>

   Legal Challenge to Internet Censorship</p>
                   <p><br>
   The Electronic Privacy Information Center, in conjunction with the American
     Civil Liberties Union and 18 other organizations, has initiated a constitutional
     challenge to the Communications Decency Act. EPIC is participating as both
     co?counsel and plaintiff. The lawsuit ?? ACLU v. Reno ?? was filed in federal
     court in Philadelphia on February 8 and seeks a declaration that the statute
     is unconstitutional. Materials on the litigation, including significant court
     documents, will be available at this page as the case proceeds.</p>
                   <p></p>
                   <p>Latest Information</p>
                   <p> Federal Court Partially Enjoins the CDA</p>
                   <p>U.S. District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter of Philadelphia
                     has issued a partial temporary restraining order prohibiting
                     enforcement of the &quot;indecency&quot; provision of the
                     Communications Decency Act (CDA). The judge declined to enjoin
                     those provisions of the Act dealing with &quot;patently offensive&quot; communications.</p>
                   <p>The court agreed with the plaintiffs' claim that the CDA
                     will have a chilling effect on free speech on the Internet
                     and found that the CDA raises &quot;serious, substantial,
                     difficult and doubtful questions.&quot; The Court further
                     agreed that the CDA is &quot;unconstitutionally vague&quot; as
                     to the prosecution for indecency. But the Court left open
                     the possibility that the government could prosecute under
                     the &quot;patently offensive&quot; provisions.</p>
                   <p>The court has recognized the critical problem with the CDA,
                     which is the attempt to apply the indecency standard to on?line
                     communications. Nonetheless, online speech remains at risk
                     because of the sweeping nature of the CDA.</p>
                   <p>The entry of the court order is a strong indication that
                     the &quot;indecency&quot; provision of the legislation that
                     went into effect on February 8 will not survive constitutional
                     scrutiny by a special three-judge court that has been impaneled
                     in Philadelphia. The panel will fully evaluate the constitutional
                     validity of the legislation and consider entry of a permanent
                     injunction against enforcement of the new law.</p>
                   <p>According to EPIC Legal Counsel David Sobel, one of the
                     attorneys representing the coalition, &quot;The court's decision
                     is a partial victory for free speech, but expression on the
                     Internet remains at risk. This is destined to become a landmark
                     case that will determine the future of the Internet.&quot;<br>
   Looking ahead to proceedings before the three-judge panel, Sobel said &quot;we
   are optimistic that further litigation of this case will demonstrate to the
   court that the CDA, in its entirety, does not pass constitutional muster.&quot;</p>

   U.S. Telecommunications Bill Fails to<br>
   Serve the Public Interest</p>
                   <p> 6 November 1995 </p>
                   <p>A bill that will change the way we use telephones, television,
                     and electronic networks is currently being considered by
                     the U.S. Congress. The bill claims to promote industry growth,
                     competition, and technological progress, but may well simply
                     end up reducing diversity and public debate. It also sets
                     precedents that we expect to be mirrored in other countries.
                     So non-U.S. residents also have good reason to be concerned
                     with the outcome of this bill. </p>
                   <p>There are four major problems in the bill: </p>
                   <p> 1.It allows oligopolies to form that control the information
                     we receive on radio, television,<br>
   newspapers, and electronic networks. </p>
                   <p> 2.It allows gaps to widen between segments of society (rich
                     and poor, educated and<br>
   uneducated). </p>
                   <p> 3.It censors public discussion on electronic networks. </p>
                   <p> 4.It lets rates rise too fast and too much. </p>
                   <p>But we may still have time to make significant changes. </p>
                   <p>Why is the telecom bill important? </p>
                   <p>The intent of the bill </p>
                   <p>What we want </p>
                   <p>What to do now </p>
                   <p>For more information </p>
                   <p>Redistributing this document </p>
                   <p></p>
                   <p>Problem 1. The bill allows oligopolies to form that control
                     the information we receive on radio, television, newspapers,
                     and electronic networks. </p>
                   <p>The wave of highly?publicized mergers (along with less sensational
                     but still important takeovers) that have reduced the number
                     of people in control of broadcasting will continue after
                     this bill is passed. Although the bill prohibits mergers
                     between telephone companies and cable TV companies, the House
                     version contains many exceptions, waivers, and exemptions
                     that erode this protection against monopolies. For instance,
                     mergers are permitted in communities with less than 50,000
                     population, and the two types of company are permitted to
                     share some transmission facilities. </p>
                   <p>Local telephone companies are allowed to enter the long?distance
                     market too soon, before competition is likely to enter their
                     traditional local market. Local telephone users may end up
                     bearing the costs of expansion. </p>
                   <p>The bill allows cooperation between companies that should
                     be competitors, assuming that abuses will be stopped by anti-trust
                     laws that are not adequate or appropriate for this kind of
                     oversight. </p>
                   <p>In a direct blow to diversity, the bill raises the percentage
                     of national audience that a single person or company can
                     reach from 25% to 35%. A larger foreign ownership of broadcast
                     media is also permitted. Limits are removed on the number
                     of radio stations that an individual can own. The bill makes
                     it easier for broadcasters to keep their licenses indefinitely,
                     without the hearings that are currently held. Finally, it
                     gives existing broadcasters a large amount of unused television
                     spectrum, instead of opening up the spectrum in an auction. </p>
                   <p><br>
   Problem 2. The bill allows gaps to widen between segments of society (rich
     and poor, educated and uneducated). </p>
                   <p>The 1934 communications act guaranteed universal service,
                     meaning that everyone in the country could get telephone
                     service at reasonable rates. The new bill contains protections
                     for rural areas and the disabled, but leaves loopholes in
                     the universal service guarantee. Some of the advanced information
                     services could well become available only to affluent people
                     or to institutions in privileged areas. </p>
                   <p>Moreover, while there are some sections supporting access
                     for schools and public agencies, these are vague and need
                     stronger guarantees. Public libraries, the traditional place
                     where all members of the public can get information, are
                     given special rates in the Senate bill but not the House. </p>
                   <p></p>
                   <p>Problem 3. The bill censors public discussion on electronic
                     networks. </p>
                   <p>Both houses of Congress have inserted sections in the bill
                     criminalizing a broad range of information under the claim
                     that it harms children. These clauses of the bill, while
                     supposedly aimed at pornography, have such vague language
                     (&quot;indecency&quot; and &quot;sexual or excretory activities&quot;)
                     that they could be used to censor literary classics and public
                     health information. </p>
                   <p>Given the open nature of networks such as the Internet,
                     restrictions on sending material that children might look
                     at ends up keeping everyone from speaking freely. The fear
                     of being caught in the law's net will force many networks
                     to shut down. Thus, the free flow of views we now have on
                     the information highway could be replaced by a controlled
                     set of ideas dished out by corporate broadcasters and monitored
                     by prosecutors all over the country. </p>
                   <p>By approving censorship, the Senate rejected a petition
                     signed by 107,000 Internet users. The House voted overwhelmingly
                     to reject government censorship, but sections imposing it
                     were inserted into the bill almost at the last minute as
                     part of a complicated amendment. </p>
                   <p>We do not dismiss the concerns of parents who want to shield
                     their children from inappropriate material. The whole point
                     is that each parent defines what is &quot;inappropriate&quot; differently.
                     There are more flexible and effective ways to screen what
                     children see, than to have the government impose censorship
                     on everybody. </p>
                   <p></p>
                   <p>Problem 4. The bill lets rates rise too fast and too much. </p>
                   <p>Cable TV rates for upper tier services (those offered for
                     extra cost) are deregulated in the bill before there is adequate
                     assurance of competition to keep the rates down. Cable operators
                     are also effectively allowed to deregulate any services they
                     choose by moving them from the basic tier to the upper tier.
                     This would reverse the consumer protections passed in 1992. </p>
                   <p>In other media, states can let rates for services rise with
                     little justification. Both the Department of Justice and
                     the FCC are severely restricted in their traditional powers
                     to review competition and rates. </p>
                   <p>As mentioned under Problem 2, rates are not regulated for
                     advanced information services. These services could end up
                     costing far more than necessary, just as cable TV companies
                     now charge premiums for popular channels. Loopholes allow
                     companies that own media (cables and phone lines) to charge
                     artificially high rates to others who wish to lease them,
                     or restrict the people leasing them to ineffective competitors. </p>
                   <p></p>
                   <p>Why is the telecom bill important? </p>
                   <p>Electronic media are not just another industry like shipping
                     or manufacturing. They deal with the very stuff our minds
                     are made of: the information we use to take political positions,
                     the choices we have in educating ourselves, the cultural
                     resources through which we define ourselves. The struggle
                     over electronic media is a struggle for our thoughts and
                     actions. </p>
                   <p>Electronic media cover a range of giant industries, including
                     radio, broadcast and cable TV,<br>
   telephone companies, wireless communications and satellites, computer networks,
   and traditional news and publishing companies that are moving online. The category
   even touches on financial institutions and electrical utilities. </p>
                   <p>The industries involved are eager to loosen restrictions
                     on their behavior. They have poured large sums of money into
                     influencing Congress, and lobbied intensively for the current
                     versions of the bill: the Telecommunications Competition
                     and Deregulation Act of 1995 in the Senate (S. 652) and the
                     Communications Act of 1995 in the House (H.R. 1555). Unfortunately
                     for the public, in removing these restrictions the telecom
                     bill also removes historic protection for diversity of opinion
                     and reasonable rates. </p>
                   <p></p>
                   <p>The intent of the bill </p>
                   <p>The stated purpose of telecom reform is to increase technology
                     in homes and institutions. While we definitely support an
                     expansion of electronic networking (the information infrastructure
                     or<br>
   information superhighway, as it is often called) we ask, &quot;What will it
   be used for?&quot; </p>
                   <p>Many broadcasting and telecommunications companies seem
                     to view their customers purely as consumers of entertainment
                     or information. But we want individuals and institutions
                     to generate content as well as receive it. </p>
                   <p>We want to see advances in telecom increase public debate
                     on important issues, provide a wealth of culture, and increase
                     our links with one another. If Congress takes its role seriously
                     in managing communications as a public resource, industry
                     growth is quite compatible with universal service and providing
                     an infrastructure for democracy. But currently, we see this
                     bill restricting options and opportunities. </p>
                   <p></p>
                   <p>What we want </p>
                   <p>Our communications channels are a public resource. As the
                     telecom bill prepares to go into conference committee, we
                     call on Congress to safeguard the public interest. </p>
                   <p> Promote diversity of programming by requiring carriers
                     to provide services to other companies at reasonable rates.
                     Protect the free marketplace of ideas by preventing yet larger
                     media monopolies and oligopolies. Keep regulatory safeguards
                     in place until proof of true competition emerges. If telephone
                     companies and cable companies merge in sparsely?populated
                     areas that lack competition, continue price regulation. Do
                     not raise the limits on the percentage of markets owned by
                     one firm or on foreign ownership. Keep the requirements for
                     interconnection and interoperability (the ability of different
                     services to use each others lines and identical protocols)
                     so that users anywhere can reach each other. Ensure that
                     users can keep telephone numbers when switching companies.
                     Reject censorship, which is a big step backward and is totally
                     unacceptable. Leave it up to parents make their own choices.
                     Strip out the provisions on &quot;Obscene or harassing use&quot; and &quot;Protection
                     of Minors.&quot; </p>
                   <p> Ensure equitable access by all segments of the population,
                     including rural areas, low?income areas, and the disabled.
                     Make the Federal-State Joint Board overseeing universal service
                     a permanent institution. Maintain reasonable rates for enhanced
                     cable services as well as basic service, either through robust
                     competition or through continued regulation. Make telephone
                     companies return to consumers some of the savings achieved
                     through greater efficiencies. Preserve preferential access
                     for public, education, and government organizations. In exchange
                     for the extra television spectrum that broadcasters can profit
                     from, require extra services such as public interest programming
                     or more diversity in programming. </p>

                   <p>What to do now </p>
                   <p>Write to your own legislators, to the people on the joint
                     committee, to Senator Robert Dole and Speaker of the House
                     Newt Gingrich, and to President Clinton. Make the points
                     listed in the What we want section of this paper.</p>
                   <p>For more information </p>
                   <p>The traditional media find this issue boring, so they don't
                     report on it. Write your local radio stations and newspapers
                     and tell them the bill has serious consequences for the public
                     and should be covered. One fine article in print is &quot;The
                     Robber Barons of the Information Highway&quot; by Joshua
                     Wolf Shenk, which appeared in the Washington Monthly in June
                     1995. </p>
                   <p> CPSR's mission</p>
                   <p>The mission of CPSR is to provide the public and policymakers
                     with realistic assessments of the power, promise, and problems
                     of information technology. As concerned citizens, CPSR members
                     work to direct public attention to critical choices concerning
                     the applications of information technology and how those
                     choices affect society. </p>
                   <p>Founded in 1981 by a group of computer scientists concerned
                     about the use of computers in nuclear weapons systems, CPSR
                     has grown into a national public?interest alliance of information
                     technology professionals and other people. Currently, CPSR
                     has 22 chapters in the U.S. and affiliations with similar
                     groups worldwide. Our National Office is in Palo Alto, California. </p>
                   <p>Every project we undertake is based on five principles: </p>
                   <p> We foster and support public discussion of, and meaningful
                     involvement in, decisions critical to society. </p>
                   <p> We work to correct misinformation while providing understandable
                     and factual analyses about the impact of societal technology. </p>
                   <p> We challenge the assumption that technology alone can solve
                     political and social problems. </p>
                   <p> We critically examine social and technical issues within
                     the computer profession, both nationally and internationally. </p>
                   <p> We encourage the use of information technology to improve
                     the quality of life. </p>
