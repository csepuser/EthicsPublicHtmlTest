       <p>Joint IEEE Computer Society and Association for Computing Machinery<br>
   Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering as a Profession<br>
   Mario R. Barbacci      
       <p>December, 1994</p>
       <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
       <p>IEEE Computer Society BoG Motion (5/93)</p>
       <p>ACM Council Resolution (8/93)</p>
       <p>Initial Recommendations (11/93)<br>
 &#8226; Rationale<br>
 &#8226; Approach<br>
 &#8226; Organization chart</p>
       <p>Notes:</p>
       <p>On May 21,1993, the IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors approved
         a motion to establish a steering committee for evaluating, planting,
         and coordinating actions related to establishing software engineering
         as a profession.</p>
       <p>
   In August 1993 the ACM Council endorsed the establishment of a Commission on
     Software Engineering to address a number of questions relating to 1) the
     terminology used to describe software engineering and those who work in the
     software area; 2) the identification of generally accepted and desired standards
     of good software practice and 3) our ability to identify, educate, and train
     individuals who are competent with software engineering and design.</p>
       <p>
   An ad-hoc committee of the Computer Society, with participation of the ACM
     worked during the Fall of 1993, defining a process and initial recommendations
     to accomplish these tasks.</p>
       <p>
   In January 1993 the President of the Computer Society made a proposal to the
     President of the ACM to streamline the steering committee and to include
     equal numbers of members appointed by the society presidents. The ACM agreed
     to the proposal and we have been operating as a Joint Steering Committee.</p>
       <p><strong>Mission Statement</strong></p>
       <p>&quot;To establish the appropriate sets(s) of standards for professional
         practice of software engineering upon which industrial decisions, professional
         certification, and educational curricula can be based.&quot;</p>
       <p><strong>Initial Recommendations(11/93)</strong></p>
       <p>Recommendation 1: Adopt Standard Definitions</p>
       <p>Recommendation 2: Define Required Body of Knowledge and Recommended
         Practices (in electrical engineering, for example, electromagnetic theory
         is part of the body of knowledge while the National Electrical Safety
         Code is a recommended practice.)</p>
       <p>Recommendation 3: Define Ethical Standards</p>
       <p>Recommendation 4: Define Educational Curricula for (a) undergraduate,
         (b) graduate (MS), and (c) continuing education (for retraining and migration).</p>
       <p>Notes:</p>
       <p>Rational for recommendation suggested by definition of &quot;Profession&quot;.</p>
       <p>
   <em>As defined by Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary:</em><br>
 &#8226; Profession: A calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long
 and Intensive<br>
   academic preparation; a principal calling, vocation or employment; the whole
   body of<br>
   persons engaged In a calling.<br>
 &#8226; Professional: (1) Relating to or characteristic of a profession; engaged
 In one of the<br>
   learned professions; characterized by or conforming to the technical or ethical
   standards<br>
   of a profession. (2) participating for gain or livelihood In an activity or
   field of endeavor<br>
   often engaged In by amateurs; engaged In by persons receiving financial returns.<br>
 &#8226; Professionalism: (1) The conduct alms or qualities that characterize
 or mark a profession or a professional person. (2) The following of a profession
 (as athletics) for gain or livelihood.</p>
       <p>
         <em>As defined in IEEE Standard 610.12:</em><br>
 &#8226; software Engineering: (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined,
 quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software;
 that Is, the application of engineering to software. (2) The study of approaches
 as is (1).<br>
 &#8226; This definition of software engineering focuses on acquisition and application
 of technical standards. It does not address the application of ethical standards.
 We covered this issue with a specific recommendation.</p>
       <p>
         <strong>Rationale</strong></p>
       <p>The recommendations have implied dependencies and should be implemented
         in the order suggested.</p>
       <p>To implement these recommendations we will establish and appoint working
         committees and task forces as necessary to accomplish the steering committee's
         work.</p>
       <p>Notes:</p>
       <p>The definition of the required body of knowledge and recommended practices
         should be driven by industry needs and should be developed first.</p>
       <p>Curricula recommendations must be consistent with the required body
         of knowledge and recommended practices. </p>
       <p>Licensing, certification, and other such regulatory insturments will
         be addressed next. This is a natural continuation to oru first set of
         reccomendations.</p>
       <p>We need to identify the boyd of knowledge, practices, and education
         required of competent software engineers before we define requred levels
         of competence.</p>

       <p>Developing survey instrument:</p>

         <li> Developed list of topics for survey on
             body of knowledge </li>

       </ul>
       <p>Notes: The required body of knowledge and recommended practices are
         not static because technology evolves and the professionals should keep
         up with
           the field.<br>
 &#8226; The development and maintenance of the set of recommended practices should
   be structured like a technical standard: adopted by consensus and subject to
   periodic revision.<br>
 &#8226; Initial version to be developed by survey of practioner.</p>
       <p><strong>Task Force Status - Ethics and Professional Practices</strong></p>

         <li> Social justice</li>
       </ul>
       <p>Notes:</p>
       <p>The initial recoomendation was to study and customize, if necessary,
         existing codes already adopted by IEEE, ACM, registration boards, and
       other relevant organizations.</p>
       <p>
   It is not clear that we need something terribly different or specific to software
     on the grounds that the standards of ethics and professional practices of
     people building antennas, processors, or databases should be different.</p>
       <p>
   However, due perhaps to the rapid expansion of the field, software developers
     sometimes do things that might be considered unethical in other fields (e.g.,
     indiscriminate copying of software in violation of copyrights or licenses.)</p>
       <p><strong>Task Force Status - Software Engineering Curriculum</strong></p>
       <p>Task force leadership appointed and ready to start working with task
         force developing survey of body of knowledge</p>
       <p>Survey results will be important input to developing curricula for SE
         (education and training)</p>
       <p>Notes: </p>
       <p>There is a debate as to whether Software Engineering is a part of Computer
         Science or vice versa. We should not be distracted by this debate from
       the goal of meeting the needs of industry.</p>
       <p>
   The objective Is to seek agreement on the curricula that should be taught and
     not necessarily on which departments teach it.</p>
