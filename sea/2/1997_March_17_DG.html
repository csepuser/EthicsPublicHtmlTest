 To: Donald Gotterbarn &lt;dgot@dmu.ac.uk&gt;<br>
 Subject: Re: your mail<br>
 <br>
 PREAMBLE<br>
 <br>
 Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, industry,government,
 medicine, education, entertainment, social affairs, and ordinary life. Those
 who contribute, by direct participation or by teaching, to the design and development
 of software systems have enormous opportunities both to do good and to cause
 harm. To assure, &quot;enormous&quot; seems a bit dramatic; &quot;significant&quot;? &quot;substantial&quot;?<br>
 as much as possible, that this power will be used for good, software engineers
 must commit themselves to making the design and development of software a beneficial,
 and respected profession. In accordance with that commitment, software engineers
 shall adhere to the following code of ethics.<br>
                     <br>
 The code contains eight keyword principles related to the behavior of and decisions
 made by professional software engineers, be they practitioners, educators, managers
 and supervisors, or policy makers, as well as trainees and students of the profession.
 The Principles identify the various relationships in which individuals, groups,
 and organizations participate and the primary obligations within these relationships.<br>
 .<br>
 Each principle of this code addresses all three levels of ethical obligation
 remove &quot;all&quot; from &quot;all three levels&quot; in the line above owed
 by professional software engineers in each of these relationships. The first
 level identified is a set of ethical values which they share with all other human
 beings by virtue of their humanity. The second level<br>
 consists of obligations shared by all professionals for a higher order of care
 for those effected by their work. The third and deeper level rewrite (into active):
 The second level obliges professionals to a higher order of care for those effected
 by their work.<br>
 should &quot;deeper&quot; be &quot;deepest&quot;? comprises several of those
 obligations which derive directly from elements unique to the professional practice
 of software engineering.<br>
 The clauses of each principle are illustrations of the various levels of obligation
 included in that relationship.<br>
                     <br>
 (Keith, we need names for each of the three types of statements in the paragraph
 below. The first is &quot;aspirational&quot; and the second and third are called
 ?
       <p><br>
   Level One: Aspire (to be human)<br>
   Level Two: Expect (to be professional)<br>
   Level Three: Demand (to use good practices)</p>
       <p><br>
   As adjectives: aspirational, expected, demanded<br>
   The clauses under each principle consist of three different types of statement.
   Aspirational statements, which provide vision and objectives, are intended
   to direct professional behavior. These directives require significant ethical
   judgement. Statements which express the obligations of all professionals and
   professional attitudes. Again they do not describe the specific behavior details
   but they clearly indicate professional responsibilities in computing. The code
   also contains some<br>
   more specific behavioral responsibilities within software engineering which
   are more closely related to the current state of the art. The range of statement
   is from the more general aspirational statement to specific measurable requirements.<br>
                       <br>
   Although all levels of professional obligation are recognized and because the
   Code contains different types of statements, the Code is not intended to be
   all inclusive nor is it &quot; intended that its individual parts be used in
   isolation to justify errors of omissions or commission (BCS). The list of Principles
   and Clauses is not exhaustive, and should not be read as separating the acceptable
   from the unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical situations.
   The Code is not a simple ethical<br>
   algorithm which generates ethical decision. should &quot;decision&quot; be &quot;decisions&quot;?<br>
   In some situations standards may conflict with each other or with standards
   from other sources. </p>
       <p>These situations require ethical judgement to act in a manner which
         is most consistent with the code of ethics, given the circumstances.
         These change the sentence above to &quot;These situations require the
         software engineer to use ethical judgement ....&quot; ethical tensions
         can best be answered by thoughtful consideration of<br>
   fundamental principles, rather than reliance on detailed regulations. (Keith,
   we should give some indication of how to prioritize here ??- First consider
   Public health safety and welfare(fairness and the well- being of others), then
   consider the impact on your kids college fund, then software quality ...etc.
   Simon says, &quot;Please tidy this up!!&quot;)<br>
   Very tough to be specific on this, Don. How about this: &quot;These principles
   should influence you to consider broadly who is affected by your work (utilitarian);
   to examine if we are treating other humans with due respect (Kantian); to speculate
   on how the public would view your decision (publicity test); to analyze how
   the least empowered will be affected by your decision (Rawlsian); and to consider
   if your acts would be considered worthy of the ideal software engineer (virtue
   ethics).&quot;<br>
   Since this code represents a consensus of those engaged in the profession one<br>
   should determine to act in a manner &quot;likely to be judged by informed,
   respected, and experienced peers in possession of all the facts as the most
   ethical way to act in the circumstances. (ACS)&quot; But even in this generality,
   the code provides support for the software engineer who needs to take positive
   action by documenting the ethical stance of the profession. This provides a
   documented ethical foundation The phrase &quot;documented ethical foundation&quot; appears
   in two many ways here. to which individuals within teams and the team as a
   whole can appeal. By indicating the ethical obligations in a particular relationship,
   the code places constraints on what others may ethically request of software
   engineers. The code helps to define those things which are ethically improper
   to request of an software engineer. </p>
       <p><br>
   Don't the last two sentences give the same information? The code has an educational
     function, by stating what is required of anyone wishing to join or continue
     in the software engineering community. Because it expresses the consensus
     of the profession on ethical issues it can be used as a guide to decision
     making and as means to educate both the public and aspiring professionals
     about the professional obligation of software engineers. Sounds reasonable
     to me.<br>
