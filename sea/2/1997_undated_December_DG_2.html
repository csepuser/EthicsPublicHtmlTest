                     v.1.0 </div>
 
                   <p align="justify">The schedule below is designed as an attempt 
 
                     to meet the Steering Committee's request that this project 
 
                     be completed by December 1997.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">General comment: As can be seen by the schedule 
 
                     below, if completion by Dec 1997 means completion of the code 
 
                     which reflects a consensus of those concerned then it is a 
 
                     very tight schedule. Another concern is that the code ought 
 
                     to be reflective of the results of the other tasks forces 
 
                     and so satisfactory completion of the code and statements 
 
                     of practice is tied to the progress of the other task forces.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> The schedule below reflects the techniques 
 
                     we used to achieve consensus on the ACM code and make clear 
 
                     to the members of the society that the code did represent 
 
                     that consensus. </p>

                     costs etc, determined by societies involved. ? . Proposed 
 
                     Task Force Structure: A balanced code will address, the engineering, 
 
                     the management and the academic facets of software engineering. 
 
                     The structure of the task reflects that balance. Rather than 
 
                     partitioning the leadership along professional association 
 
                     membership lines, the executive committee represents three 
 
                     areas that need to be represented in the code; a software 
 
                     engineering coordinator and a technical management coordinator. 
 
                     The previous organization of the SEEPP task force divided 
 
                     the group along lines of ethical issues into separate working 
 
                     groups. This was not productive. The proposed structure of 
 
                     a single panel of experts allows individual experts to contribute 
 
                     where their specialty is involved. The panel includes members 
 
                     from several professional societies including; the ACM, the 
 
                     IEEE-CS, the ICCP, the BCS, IEE, IDP and the Deutsche Gesellshaft 
 
                     Fur Informatik. It also includes practicing software engineers 
 
                     and ethics advisors for major, multinational corporations. 
 
                     The panel also has an international representation from places 
 
                     such as Egypt, England, Germany, and Scotland. </p>
