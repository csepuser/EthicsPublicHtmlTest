         1 <br>
         Dear Task Force Members, 
      </p>
      <p>1. Thank you!<br>
         I'd like to thank those who commented on my draft on Functions of Codes 
         of Ethics and who contributed to annotating the code. I would especially 
         like to thank Ed for his effort.</p>
       <p>2 Baseline Document<br>
         As you may recall, the plan was, while you are commenting on the Functions 
         of Code paper, I would be collating your contributions to annotating the 
         codes and writing a description of its architecture and then I would distribute 
         a draft of this document to you for you comments. The working copy of 
         that document is attached In the interest of good configuration management 
         please use this as the base from which we work and send your comments 
         to the list or to me. The twelve codes we have used in the comparison 
         are sufficient to demonstrate the roots of the proposed codes in other 
         relevant professional codes. We have integrated Ed's results into the 
         baseline document. The comparison is set up as a table for ease of comparison 
         between codes and code elements The table is attached as a Microsoft Word 
         Document.</p>
       <p>3 Complete Consensus Functions paper<br>
         While you are reviewing the this code comparison and making comments, 
         I will be revising the Functions paper in the light of your comments This 
         will get us well on the way to completing the tasks set for us by the 
         Steering Committee.</p>
       <p>4. Additional Help and Suggested Code Modifications<br>
         I am fortunate to be at the Center for Computing and Social Responsibility 
         this semester, which is supplying both intellectual and clerical support 
         for this effort. We have received many comments on the draft code. We 
         are integrating the comments with the code and making some of the tentative 
         changes to the code based on these comments. That document should be ready 
         for distribution to you for comment shortly.</p>
       <p>5 Tentative Plan<br>
         The process of completing a code of ethics and getting it accepted by 
         professional societies is a complex process In broadest terms, the next 
         steps are 1 to submit a revised code to the steering committee for review 
         and comment, 2. Revise the code in the light of their comments, 3 Circulate 
         the code more widely for comment and revise accordingly. 4. Print the 
         Code in the ACM and IEEE publications with a survey asking for comments 
         and voting on each item. This will include a request for revision of an 
         code element when there is disagreement 5 Revisit the code in the light 
         of these comments and votes. 6. This step will be determined by the results 
         of 5.</p>
       <p>6, Thanks again for you help.</p>
       <p>Regards</p>
       <p>Don<br>

         DRAFT DOCUMENT RELATING<br>
         COMPUTING, ENGINEERING, AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODES. v2 30 Jan 1997</p>
       <p>The Architecture of the Draft Software Engineering Code of Ethics and<br>
         Its Relations to other Codes of Ethics<br>
         Gotterbarn &amp; Rogerson<br>
         Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility</p>
       <p>This document was developed in response to a request for the IEEE?CS/ACM 
         Joint Steering Committee for The Professionalization of Software Engineering. 
         The architecture of the draft Software Engineering Code of Ethics (SECEvl) 
         has been modified in the light of comments from the software engineering 
         and computer ethics communities. It should be noted that we use the term 
         software engineer to include the entire software engineering community; 
         those software engineers practicing in the private and public sector and 
         those in software engineering education.</p>
       <p>The structure of SECEvI was modeled on the format of the National Society 
         of Professional Engineers Code of Ethics(NSPE) in so far as it addresses 
         the various ethical responsibilities of the professional in terms of the 
         particular relationships in which the professional stands Thus the first 
         version was organized around the software engineer's obligations in product 
         development, obligations to the public, obligations to use professional 
         judgement, obligations to the client and the employer, obligations to 
         the profession of software engineering, obligations to colleagues, and 
         obligation to self as a practicing professional Each of these relationships 
         carry different ethical obligations and the practicing professional must 
         be cognizant of all of these obligations. Following this code Following 
         the NSPE code closely led to many of the statements in the SECEvI closely 
         resembling statements in NSPE (See attached table below for details of 
         this relationship)</p>
       <p>The committee then examined other codes including. The .ACM Code of Ethics 
         and Professional Conduct, The IEEE Code of Ethics, Project Management 
         Institute Code of Ethics for the Project Management Profession,. American 
         Institute of Certified Public Accountants Professional Standards Manual, 
         PA State Registration Board of Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors 
         and Geologists The Code of Ethics and the Law, and The Unwritten Laws 
         of Engineering by W J. King American Society of Mechanical Engineers. 
         The members of the committee used these and other codes as models for 
         elements that they thought ought to be included in a code of ethics for 
         software engineers.</p>
       <p>SECEvI was then distributed beyond the committee for comment. In the 
         light of those comments and further cork by the Committee tile structure 
         of the code has been revised to reflect more closely some significant 
         aspects of other engineering and computing codes that were not included 
         in SECEvl.</p>
       <p>Many codes, such as the British Computer Society's Code of Conduct and 
         Code of Practice, and the ACM's Code of Ethics and Professional conduct, 
         include a preamble describing the roles and functions of the code for 
         the practicing professional. These generally include a description of 
         the use of the code and some very high level ethical imperatives. They 
         also make clear that codes of ethics are to be used as guidelines for 
         conduct and not as exhaustive lists of the ethical obligations of professionals. 
         For example the preamble to the British Computer Society Code of Practice 
         states &quot;The Code is to be viewed as a whole Individual parts are 
         not intended to be used in isolation to justify errors of omission or 
         commission. The Code is intended to be observed in the spirit and not 
         merely in the word.&quot; One of the ways to avoid this misunderstanding 
         of reading the code as an ethics checklist is to organize the code into 
         a hierarchy of Cannons, Rules, Principles, or Ethical Imperatives which 
         form the top level of a hierarchy and attach at lower levels guidelines 
         which by way of example make clear the intent of the top level principles. 
         The structure of SECEv1 has been revised in accordance with this model.</p>
       <p>SECEv2 starts with a preamble explaining the roles and functions of the 
         code The Preamble is followed by a set of 7 principles based on the relationship 
         in which a software engineer has ethical obligations. These principles 
         are tied to key words indicating the relationship. The use of keywords 
         is a powerful memory guide for the code Limiting the main body of the 
         code to these seven principles will make it easier to remember and make 
         the code more reflective of the impact of changing technology on the breadth 
         of ethical obligations of the practicing software engineer. For each principle 
         there are several specific examples (many drawn from other codes) which 
         show what these principles require when put in practice. This division 
         of the code makes it consistent with the three levels of professional 
         obligation defined in &quot;Functions of Codes of Ethics&quot;(attached), 
         namely the code contains level 1 ethical obligations based on the humanity 
         of the professional, level 2 ethical obligation based on the higher order 
         of care due by all professionals, and level 3 obligations which are tied 
         directly to the practice of the profession.</p>
       <p>As other professions have realized, in developing a code one cannot leave 
         out obligations that are common to all professions and only consider level 
         three? software engineering practice obligations. To leave out level 1 
         and level 2 obligations reduces software engineering from a profession 
         to a technical practice The revised structure of SECEv1 makes the code 
         comprehensive in that it includes both generic items and profession specific 
         items. Anything short of this would be meaningless and useless in the 
         emergence of software engineering as a profession.</p>
       <p>The following table compares 12 different codes of ethics, conduct and 
         practice to the preliminary version of the Software Engineering Code of 
         Ethics(SECEvl). In the 12 codes, four are from computer organizations, 
         five from engineering organizations and the IEEE code which also covers 
         the IEEE?CS.</p>
       <p>The original purpose of documenting the architecture of the code to show 
         which parts are derived from other codes and which parts are unique to 
         software engineering presumed that there are clear lines of demarcation 
         between engineering, computing, and software engineering. The results 
         of this study into computing and engineering codes of ethics are not consistent 
         with that presumption.</p>
       <p>Several studies have shown that codes of ethics operate on many levels. 
         On the highest level imperatives grounded in our common humanity?? most 
         codes contain ethical principles of honesty and integrity(Level 1). SECEv1 
         has this kind of imperative in common with all of the other codes examined. 
         Professional codes of ethics also have in common the professional's commitment 
         to a higher level of care(Level 2). These obligations of all professions 
         and practicing professionals are stated in terms of commitment to the 
         public interest over self interest. Again all of the codes have similar 
         imperatives about professionals having a higher order of obligation to 
         the public they serve rather than having the kind of moral obligation 
         demanded of the general public.</p>
       <p>The major difference between codes occurs at level 3; the statement of 
         obligations specific to a particular profession. Some imperative may be 
         stated in terms of level 1 in one code while they are stated at level 
         3 in another code For example Rule 7 of SECEvI is compared with IEEE 6 
         IEEE 6 states the professional obligation &quot;.. to maintain and improve 
         technical competence and to undertake technological tasks for others only 
         if qualified by training or experience.&quot; while Rule 7 addresses the 
         same moral obligation at level 3 and talks about more specific competencies 
         within the practice of software engineering. 7 0?7 6 are software engineering 
         specific (level 3) obligations to maintain knowledge in particular software 
         engineering areas. Most of the cross references for 7.0?7 6 refer to a 
         single level 2 admonition to keep current in your profession. The difference 
         between codes occurring primarily at level 3 also helps explain the sparse 
         number of cross references to Rule 1 SECEvI which is software product 
         specific</p>
       <p>Most of the imperatives in SECvl are in several of the codes of ethics 
         used for comparisons. At the moment some imperatives are contained mostly 
         in engineering codes (the outer columns of the chart) and some imperatives 
         are contained mostly in computing codes (the inner columns of the chart). 
         Those elements which currently are sparsely reflected in engineering and 
         computer codes have to do with management issues and some very specific 
         imperatives, some of which are technical issues in software engineering. 
         As the code develops, to include elements that recognize the role of teams 
         in software engineering, there will be more elements at level 3 which 
         distinguish SECEv2 from both computing and engineering codes.</p>
       <p>Explanation of the table: The fast column refers to sections of the SECv1. 
         Only those items which closely matched the statements m SECv1 are referenced 
         If the referenced item in the other code is almost a direct quotation, 
         then the reference appears in single quotes.</p>
       <p>The codes used for comparison, listed in alphabetical order, are The 
         American association of Engineering Societies, Model Crude for Professional 
         Conduct(AAES), Accreditation Board for Engineering Technology's, Code 
         of Ethics for Engineers(ABET C of E) and Guidelines for The Fundamental 
         Cannon of Ethics(ABET G); The Association of Computing Machinery's Code 
         of Ethics(ACM), and Guidelines for Professional Conduct(ACM G), The British 
         Computer Society Code of Conduct(BCS C to C); The British Computer Society 
         , Code of Practice(BCS C of P): The Institute for the Certification of 
         computing Professionals (ICCP); The Engineer's Council for Professional 
         Development, Faith of the Engineer(ECPD Faith); The Institute of Electronical 
         and Electronics Engineers, Code of Ethics(IEEE C of E), The National Society 
         of Professional Engineers, Code of Ethics for Engineers(NSPE C of E), 
         and the Protect Management Institute &quot;Code of Ethics for the Protect 
         Management Profession (PMT Several of these codes did not contain section 
         and paragraph numbers, so the following reference procedure was followed. 
         If the document was not divided into sections, its paragraphs were simply 
         numbered sequentially starting with 1</p>
       <p>If the code was divided into sections and paragraphs, The paragraphs 
         were given an alphabetical designation and the paragraphs within each 
         section were numbered sequentially starting with 1</p>
       <p>Most of the codes are in Ethics in Engineering, Martin and Schinzinger, 
         and the ACM BCS, IEEE codes are on the NET</p>
