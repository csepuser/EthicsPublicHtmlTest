 Subject: A paper from a task force similar to ours in Germany.
       <p>I was going to send this to Don, the keeper of papers and
                     other reference materials, but I thought the rest of you
                     might be interested in reading this and the next paper from
                     the Gessellschaft fur Informatik (GI). I met Karl?Heinz Roediger
                     at the IFIP WG9.1 workshop in Cuba on Ethics and Politics
                     of Systems Design. I think a lot of what the GI is doing
                     is very similar to what we are trying to accomplish on our
                     task force. See especially the next message.<br>

         <strong>1. Computer Science - a maturing profession</strong><br>
         Computer science is a maturing profession that after a long and dynamic
           process of expansion now begins to reflect its role in society. The
           German professional
     association, Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI), supports the generation and
     evolution of professional standards of many types including standards of
           social responsibility and professional ethics. While this process has
           been implicitly
     supported from the beginning it becomes more explicit by the development
           of guidelines for professionally correct behavior.</p>
       <p>Such standards are of course present in the everyday practice
                     of every member of the professional and scientific community,
                     but this proves also that this behavior is derived and supported
                     by many different and sometimes contradictionary experiences,
                     attitudes and values. Once correct and responsible behavior
                     is to be defined in ethical and professional guidelines the
                     extend of these contradictions becomes visible. Under this
                     impression it may look preferable to do without an explicit
                     definition.</p>
                   <p>But this is in clear contrast to the society's demand to
                     plan, to use, to control and to understand information technological
                     processes and products. If computer scientists and professionals
                     do not reach some public agreement with users and buyers
                     there are good chances that some governmental action for
                     the external
                     regulation of these relations will take over, maybe by law
   or by other enforced constraints. Privacy protection, liability law, centralized
                     regulations for the conduct of examinations or the right
                     of informational self?determination are examples of such
                     external regulations, which are to be obeyed strictly, but
                     which sometimes are only the second best choice. It seems
                     to be preferable if such regulations were propagated (and
                     may
                     be even enforced) by the professional community itself.<br>
     Ethical codices and ethical guidelines are two examples how to regulate professional
     quality below the juridical level. In their development professional responsibility
     became a central
                     issue of professional ethics in the last
     decades. Scientific communities in plural societies are part of these societies
     and share its conditions and limits. To speak for all of its members inside
     society, these conditions and limits cannot be ignored. This restricts the
     professional?ethical discourse in its result ? but not in its discussion,
     where plural and conflicting points of view may be discussed.</p>
                   <p><strong>2. Ethical Codices as instruments defining professional
                     attitudes</strong></p>
                   <p>The first ethical codices for computer scientist were proposed
                     by ACM and BCS in the early seventies, following the example
                     of many professional engineering and other scientific societies.
                     BCS voted for such a code in 1971, ACM followed 1972. Both
                     codices underwent revisions in 1992.</p>
                   <p>Since the late eighties IFIP tried to define a global code
                     of ethics, initially driven by the former chairman of the
                     Technical Committee on Computers and Society, H. Sackman.
                     In the technical tradition of information technology and
                     computer science, this code should be trans?cultural, transcending
                     (or ignoring) the quite different cultural, social, economical,
                     political, and juridical borders between IFIP members national
                     societies. This is certainly a very difficult task and the
                     first proposal by the TC9-chairman did not convince TC?members
                     that this task was achieved. Meanwhile a somewhat different
                     track has been proposed. The Council of European Professional
                     Informatics Societies CEPIS recently announced a first proposal
                     on professional ethics and asked their members to think about
                     such regulations within their organizations, but this first
                     CEPIS proposal looks still quite insufficient to many professionals.</p>
                   <p>The idea of a codex that transcends cultural and society
                     borders demonstrates not only that global regulations may
                     be difficult to achieve but also that the codex form by itself
                     is not free of problems. Even within the industrialized countries
                     there is the basic distinction between juridical systems
                     based on the anglo-american case law and juridical systems
                     based on the code Napoleon or the roman tradition. Another
                     basic distinction exists between countries of different economic
                     order or of completely different religious or ideological
                     value tradition. It is hard to belief that a single global
                     IFIP-code should be ethically acceptable for professionals
                     in islamic fundamentalistic traditions, chinese communist
                     or other national traditions. In the best of all perspectives,
                     this case seems to be hopeless, but probably it prolongs
                     an imperiaistic view of technological advancement to be only
                     possible in industrialized countries. Since 1992 the IFIP
                     Ethics Task Group and its chairman Jacques Berleur follow
                     a different route, assembling an ethics reader, which may
                     help to develop some recommendations.</p>
                   <p>Ethical questions appear as singular questions, where a
                     general rule should be applied. To understand the peculiarities
                     and difficulties arising from the individual case, it is
                     considered useful, to discuss such cases. Before any sanctions
                     a public discourse on example cases seems to be useful. Regulations
                     may follow these cases, otherwise they may be of little or
                     no influence to the professional community. The ACM is following
                     arguably the opposite route: First they installed a codex,
                     then they discussed cases. This may be acceptable, when the
                     common foundation of the codex is beyond discussion, but
                     it remains of questionable practical value in a pluralistic
                     society, where dominating (christian) values serve more or
                     less as lip-service. The actual state of computer science
                     and its rapid moving dynamics do hardly allow such a fixed
                     value initialization (e. g., as part of the statutes). Alternatively
                     a more fluid process, namely a formally sanctioned discourse
                     on ethical problems using some initial ethical guidelines
                     seems to be more promising regarding their effective consequences.
                     Guidelines may be used for the discussion
     of actual conflicts as for basic decisions with the advantage that guidelines
     may be adapted to the actual development on medium terms (which is much more
     difficult if it is integral part of the statutes).</p>
                   <p><br>
                     <strong> 3. A Task Force for Professional Ethics</strong><br>
                     Discourses as a formalized procedure are a method of scientific
                       exchange well adopted by the Gesellschaft fur Informatik
                       (GI) since mid-eighties. The Fachbereich
     8 Informatik and Gesellschaft (Technical Committee on Computer Science and
     Society) of the GI initiated a first paper on Computer Science and Responsibility
     in 1988 (Roediger et al., 1991). This paper did not fit the GI?statutes,
                       which had no place for ethical guidelines. This changed
                       with a complete revision
     of the statutes in 1992 where the organization as a whole wanted to integrate
     an ethical guideline in the statutes. This is the first positive formulation
     of such a guideline in the 25 years of the organization's existence. The
                       former GI President Roland Vollmar installed a pluralist
                       and interdisciplinary working
     group within Fachbereich 8, which did not only consist of computer scientists
     and engineers, but also of natural and social scientists, jurists, philosophers
     and theologians. This task force proposed within half a year of rigid work,
     meeting every month, an ethical guideline. This ethical guideline proposal
     was adopted by Fachbereich 8 and is now to be acknowledged by the presidium
     and to be become a by-law of the new statutes. This should happen in January
     1994. Due to the present state of the guidelines there are only very few
                       actual experiences with the discourse. This should change
                       rapidly after the guidelines
     have been finally adopted.</p>
                   <p>The notion ethical guideline was preferred to the notion
                     of a ethical codex to demonstrate the open character of the
                     proposal The guideline differentiates between ethical expectations
                     to a member, members in leading positions, members in research
                     and education and ethical expectations to the organization
                     GI as a whole. Included is the demand for. continued education
                     and acquisition of competence not only in computer science
                     but also in its relevant applications, thus reflecting the
                     dynamic professional growth and change. Ethical discourses
                     as collective learning and self?understanding are central
                     aspects of the guideline. A collection of case studies of
                     conflicts should aid a common ethical reflection and the
                     further development of the guideline and its adaptation to
                     changes in society. Basically the paper recommends and tries
                     to help. As a consequence of this attitude, the guidelines
                     impose no sanctions (though the statutes have some regulations
                     for cases of extremely disorderly professional behavior).</p>
                   <p>The GI has not adopted the ACM?policy of an ethical codex
                     (and certainly not the details of such culturally and politically
                     sensitive instrument, but GI has well adopted the ACM?strategy
                     to make ethical conflicts visible, discussible and solvable.
                     Peter Neumanns Risks of Computing newsletter is considered
                     as a valuable example for a collection of ethical case studies
                     as part of the ethical discourse. This collection shall report
                     on ethical conflicts (necessarily sometimes in alienated
                     form) and it shall be commented by the working group, to
                     support and evoke discussions on professional ethical behavior
                     in the GI. This should support members in conflict situations,
                     helping where professional civil courage needs collective
                     support. The ACM tradition to discuss ethical conflicts in
                     self-assessment form or as discussion papers shall be adopted.
                     The discourse scheme was preferred over the codex scheme
                     because
                     of positive experiences gained in comparable processes in
                     working groups on</p>
                   <p> 
   Juridical Control of Information Technologies (Wilhelm 1993) and on Theory
     of Informatics (Coy et al. 1992). Discourses were considered to be an adequate
     answer to a rapidly growing complexity of the information systems, where
     individual responsibility must be supported by collective processes. The
     actual philosophical and political discussion has given only few and hesitant
     answers. With the ethical discourse project we hope to complement individual
     professional ethics, which can no longer cope with the growing complexities
     of a globally interconnected world of information technology.<br>
