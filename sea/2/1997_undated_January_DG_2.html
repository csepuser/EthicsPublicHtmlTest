                   <p>Keith, </p>
 
                   <p>I hope you have some time. We need to have a draft of an 
 
                     improved code to the steering committee by 14 February, put 
 
                     it must pass through the task force before then. I would like 
 
                     to send the task force a draft on Saturday or Sunday at the 
 
                     latest. The draft to the steering committee is still an incomplete 
 
                     draft, according to the schedule; but it must show significant 
 
                     improvement over the first draft. </p>
 
                   <p>This is the first of three(3) messages, all with the same 
 
                     form. The code below has all revisions indicated by numbers 
 
                     in parenthesis. The meaning of each parenthetical number is 
 
                     at the end of the document. Please print the document and 
 
                     go through the code and the reasons for the changes in paralell, 
 
                     inserting you comments and suggestions for changes to the 
 
                     code and changes to the justifications. Both the changes and 
 
                     the justifications will be tranmitted..</p>
 
                   <p>We tried to address your concerns in this version of Principles 
 
                     1 and 2. The other messages have Principles 3-4 and Principles 
 
                     5-7+. 
 
                     (aside- I called the lower level statements 'clauses' do you 
 
                     have a better term?)</p>
 
                   <p>In your comments , if you could formulate th clause the way 
 
                     you would like to see it, it would help.</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     Thanks for the help. I look forward to seeing you comments.</p>
 
                   <p>Any thoughts on the schdule and the structure documents?</p>
 
                   <p>Best regards,</p>
 
                   <p>don</p>
 
                   <p> code Rules 1-2- version 2 1. </p>
 
                   <p>Strucutre. Code starts with a preamble- yet to be worked 
 
                     out- probably when finish with rest of code.</p>
 
                   <p>Change Rules to Principles.; strucutre the code around the 
 
                     seven key word Principles. Following each principle is a list 
 
                     of clauses(obligations,aspirations,expansions) to that principle. 
 
                     The clauses within the principle are clustered by level- level 
 
                     1 general human ethics, level2 generic professional oligation, 
 
                     level 3 specific SE obligation. Look at what we suggest for 
 
                     Rule 1 as an example of this. The balance of elements at each 
 
                     level will differ from Principle to Principle depending on 
 
                     the nature of the Principle. </p>
 
                   <p> Since the Principles are key to the strucutre we will need 
 
                     to carefully define them</p>
 
                   <p>We see Principle 1 Product, as starting with level 2-3 obligations 
 
                     that lead to useful and acceptable software then stating level 
 
                     1-2 things the SE should aspire toward to reach the goal of 
 
                     a quality product.</p>
 
                   <p align="left">A list justifying the changes we are suggestung 
 
                     for the first two Principles is listed below.. The changes 
 
                     are identified by a number in parenthesis (number). Purely 
 
                     gramatical changes are not identified. </p>

                     February 1967</p>
 
                   <p align="center">INTRODUCTION &lt; SKIP&gt; </p>
 
                   <p>(1) Principle 1: PRODUCT. Software engineers shall, insofar 
 
                     as possible, assure that the software on which they work is 
 
                     useful (2) and of acceptable quality to the public, the employer, 
 
                     the (3) client, and the user, completed on time and at reasonable 
 
                     cost, and free of (3a) error. In particular, software engineers 
 
                     shall, as appropriate:</p>
 
                   <p> 1.01. (4)Ensure that specifications for software on which 
 
                     they work have been (5)well documented, satisfy the user's 
 
                     requirements, and have the customer's approval. </p>
 
                   <p>1.02. (6) Strive to understand fully the specifications for 
 
                     software on which they work.</p>
 
                   <p> 1.03. (4)Ensure that they are qualified, by education (7) 
 
                     or experience, for any project on which they work (8) or propose 
 
                     to work..</p>
 
                   <p> 1.04. (4)Ensure proper goals and objectives for any project 
 
                     on which they work. </p>
 
                   <p>1.05 (4)Ensure (9)an appropriate development methodology 
 
                     on any project on which they work(8) or propose to work. </p>
 
                   <p>1.06. (4)Ensure (9) good management on any project on which 
 
                     they work, including (9) effective procedures for control 
 
                     of quality and risk. </p>
 
                   <p>1.07. (4)Ensure (9)realistic estimates of cost, schedule, 
 
                     personnel, and outcome on any project on which they work (8)or 
 
                     propose to work.</p>
 
                   <p> 1.08. (4)Ensure adequate documentation on any project on 
 
                     which they work, including a log of problems discovered and 
 
                     solutions adopted. </p>
 
                   <p>1.09. (4)Ensure (9) adequate testing, debugging, and review 
 
                     of software and related documents on which they work. </p>
 
                   <p>1.10. (10) Aspire to develop software and related documents 
 
                     that respect the privacy of those who will be subjected to 
 
                     that software. </p>
 
                   <p>1.11 (10)Aspire to use only accurate data derived from legal 
 
                     sources and use only in ways properly authorized. </p>
 
                   <p>1.12. (10)Aspire to identify define and address ethical, 
 
                     economic, cultural, legal, and environmental issues.</p>
 
                   <p> 1.13. Promote maximum (11) quality and minimum cost to the 
 
                     employer, the (3) client, the user, and the public (11a) and 
 
                     make any tradeoffs clear to all parties concerned.</p>
 
                   <p> 1.14. (10) Aspire to use standard practices, departing from 
 
                     these only when technically justified.</p>
 
                   <p> Rule 2: PUBLIC. Software engineers shall, in their professional 
 
                     role, act only in ways consistent with the public safety, 
 
                     health and welfare. In particular, software engineers shall: 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons (12) or authorities 
 
                     any (13) actual or potential danger that the software or related 
 
                     documents on which they work(14) or are aware of may pose 
 
                     to the user, a third party, or the environment. </p>
 
                   <p>2.02. Approve software only if they have a well?(15)founded 
 
                     belief that it is safe, meets specifications, and has passed 
 
                     (15a) appropriate tests,(16) and does not deminish quality 
 
                     of life or harm the environment. </p>
 
                   <p>2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared under 
 
                     their supervision (17) or within their areas of competence 
 
                     (17a) and with which they are in agreement.</p>
 
                   <p> 2.04. Co-operate in efforts to (18) address matters of grave 
 
                     public concern in software or related documents.</p>
 
                   <p> 2.05. Be fair and truthful in all (19) statements, particularly 
 
                     public ones, concerning software or related documents. </p>
 
                   <p>2.06. Not put self?interest, the interest of an employer, 
 
                     the interest of a client (3), or the interest of the user 
 
                     ahead of the public's interest. </p>
 
                   <p>2.07. Accept full responsibility for their own work.</p>
 
                   <p>Rule 3: JUDGMENT. Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, 
 
                     protect both the independence of their professional judgment 
 
                     and their reputation for such judgment. In particular, software 
 
                     engineers shall, as appropriate: </p>
 
                   <p>Modifications 
 
                     1. Change &quot;Rule&quot; to &quot;Principle&quot; since 
 
                     these are not really a single rules but statements that embody 
 
                     a sets of activities. This change lessens the possibility 
 
                     of misreading of the code as a checklist,.</p>
 
                   <p>2. This introduces professional commitment to quality at 
 
                     an early level and helps to answer the &quot;who is to say&quot; 
 
                     question.</p>
 
                   <p>3. Replace all uses of word 'customer with word 'client'. 
 
                     'Client' is a less domain specific word. In a maintenance 
 
                     situation the client is the person who delivered the task 
 
                     to you. Client could also be a student or the professional 
 
                     receiving services from the professional organization. This 
 
                     change introduces some consistency missing from later clauses. 
 
                     &quot;Client&quot; is a person using the services of X.</p>
 
                   <p>3a. We felt uncomfortable with the phrase 'significant error'. 
 
                     It may be used as an escape clause- 'I had lots of errors 
 
                     but didn't think any of them significant'. Instead we deleted 
 
                     the word 'significiant' and handled more detail about error 
 
                     in Principle 2.</p>
 
                   <p>4. Replace 'assure&quot; with &quot;ensure&quot;. 'Ensure' 
 
                     is less legal than 'assure' which carries a formal guarantee 
 
                     and legal connotation (according to the OED); whilst 'ensure' 
 
                     means to strive to make a thing happen and no formal guarantee 
 
                     implied. This change is made for most future occurrences of 
 
                     'assure'. </p>
 
                   <p>5. Replace 'in writing' with more generic 'well documented' 
 
                     to allow for multimedia capture of specifications. </p>
 
                   <p>6. Replace 'assure' with 'Strive to'; used a purely aspirational 
 
                     term here to placate those who appeal to impossibility of 
 
                     precise specs. It is also consistent with Ed's response to 
 
                     the steering committee.</p>
 
                   <p>7. Change ' and' to 'or' in 1.03 to include those who have 
 
                     good technical knowledge and to make clear that 'qualified 
 
                     by education' does not imply paper qualification. </p>
 
                   <p>8. Add clause to 103.105, and 107 'or propose to work' because 
 
                     this encourages a professionals commitment to develop the 
 
                     requisite skills prior to taking on new responsibilities.</p>
 
                   <p>9. Replace 'proper' in several clauses with a less vague 
 
                     phrase. For example in this clause there are technical answers 
 
                     to the question 'which methods are appropriate?'</p>
 
                   <p>Clause 1.01-1.09 are more technical than 1.10-1.14. It is 
 
                     in these clauses where we started to more emphatically introduce 
 
                     commitments to society embodied in product development.</p>
 
                   <p>10 Used more aspirational and intentional phrase for these 
 
                     level 1 type obligations in 1.10-1.14</p>
 
                   <p>11 Replace &quot;productivity&quot; with &quot;quality&quot;.</p>
 
                   <p>11a add &quot;and make tradeoffs clear to all parties concerned&quot; 
 
                     which acknowledges the clients right to informed consent</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 2</p>
 
                   <p>12 Insert word &quot;authorities&quot; because want to refer 
 
                     to someone who can remedy the problem.</p>
 
                   <p>13 Insert 'actual or potential' because if we only respond 
 
                     to actual dangers then one does not have an obligation to 
 
                     address potential dangers.</p>
 
                   <p>14 Added 'or are aware of' because as stated, you only have 
 
                     obligations to report dangers of projects you are working 
 
                     on. Someone next to you can be working on a dangerous project 
 
                     and there is no stated obligation to address the problem. 
 
                     Both ACM and IEEE code require the reporting of dangers 'you 
 
                     are aware of'. </p>
 
                   <p>15 Replace 'well-documented' with 'well-founded'.</p>
 
                   <p>15a Delete 'all' to avoid the suggestion that exhaustive 
 
                     testing is required</p>
 
                   <p>16. Added specific commitments to protect the public and 
 
                     the ability to use the approval process to do it.</p>
 
                   <p>17. Replace 'and' with 'or' to allow for approvals where 
 
                     the SE is not in a supervisory role. </p>
 
                   <p>17a. add &quot;and to which they are in agreement&quot; otherwise 
 
                     clause requires you to sign all things just because they are 
 
                     in your area of expertise.</p>
 
                   <p>18. Restructured this statement to address a public issue. 
 
                     As stated this clause was strictly product related. </p>
 
                   <p>19 The clause as it stood indicated that it was ok to lie 
 
                     in non public statements.</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                   </p>
