                   <p>Don,</p>
 
                   <p> I have reviewed the draft Software Engineering Code of Ethics 
 
                     that you sent me. It is an impressive document, full of interesting, 
 
                     important points, covering a wide range of topics in considerable 
 
                     detail. Your committee clearly decided to go for completeness 
 
                     as opposed to brevity, the opposite of the choice made by 
 
                     the IEEE. (I might mention here that the IEEE Ethics Committee 
 
                     plans to attempt to get the best of both approaches, by developing, 
 
                     over a period of time, an extended set of guidelines for the 
 
                     IEEE code.) </p>
 
                   <p>I don't have enough time to give your draft the kind of really 
 
                     careful study that it deserves, so I will simply pass on to 
 
                     you a few brief suggestions that occurred to me as I went 
 
                     over it. Without debating the merits of the comprehensive 
 
                     approach, it seems to me that, with careful editing, this 
 
                     draft could be compressed to a measurable degree without sacrificing 
 
                     any substance. </p>
 
                   <p>You very possibly have already seen it, but in case you haven't, 
 
                     I am appending a copy of a Swedish code that I found very 
 
                     interesting. I refer to it in my first comment. Again, let 
 
                     me say that I think you and your committee did a really fine 
 
                     job.</p>
 
                   <p> Best regards, </p>
 
                   <p>Steve </p>
 
                   <p align="center">.....................</p>
 
                   <p> 1. Altho your item 1.07 is similar, the wording of item 
 
                     3 of the Swedish code is very nice and perhaps might suggest 
 
                     some adjustment in your statement. It reads: &quot;only take 
 
                     part in projects with the time and resources assigned that 
 
                     make it possible to do a good job.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>2. In item 2.06 you say, &quot;Be fair and truthful in all 
 
                     statements...&quot;. Consider using a term such as &quot;avoid 
 
                     deception&quot;, which not only prohibits falsehoods, but 
 
                     also covers the case of deceiving via not disclosing relevant 
 
                     information, in other words, deception by omission. </p>
 
                   <p>3. It ought to be possible to merge items 3.03 and 3.04 in 
 
                     a single statement that would cover offering, soliciting, 
 
                     and accepting bribes. </p>
 
                   <p>4. Item 4.01 reading, &quot;Provide service only in areas 
 
                     of their competence.&quot; may be a bit too restrictive. There 
 
                     are circumstances where it may be appropriate to accept assignments 
 
                     outside one's area of competence. The important point is to 
 
                     disclose fully one's limitations. (See item 6 of the IEEE 
 
                     code.)</p>
 
                   <p> 5. While it may be implied by the current wording of 5.03, 
 
                     it might be well to make more explicit a requirement that 
 
                     the professional development of subordinates be given some 
 
                     consideration when giving them work assignments</p>
 
                   <p>. 6. Item 6.07. &quot;Only accept remuneration appropriate 
 
                     to professional qualifications or experience&quot; may be 
 
                     a good rule to advocate, but I don't think it is appropriate 
 
                     in an ethics code.</p>
 
                   <p> 7. Item 6.05 reads: &quot;Report anything reasonably believed 
 
                     to be a violation of this code to appropriate authorities.&quot; 
 
                     While I am not prepared to generate a big argument about this, 
 
                     it somehow bothers me. A minor point is that, for many parts 
 
                     of the code, there might not be any &quot;appropriate authorities&quot; 
 
                     to report to. Perhaps more basic is a vague distaste with 
 
                     requiring people to &quot;turn in&quot; delinquent colleagues. 
 
                     This is NOT to deny that there are many cases where this is 
 
                     appropriate and necessary, but I wonder if it should be made 
 
                     into a universal rule. Rule 2.01 covers an important subset 
 
                     of such cases. This might be expanded by including, for example 
 
                     situations where other forms of harm to people, such as theft, 
 
                     fraud, or plagiarism is involved. </p>
 
                   <p>8. Item 7.03, &quot;Credit fully the work of others.&quot; 
 
                     might be expanded by including an item enjoining against taking 
 
                     credit for the work of others. Here, I have in mind the common 
 
                     practice of managers or professors adding their names as coauthors 
 
                     of papers to which they made no substantial contributions. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>9. Item 7.07, &quot;Not interfere in the professional career 
 
                     progression of any colleague.&quot; is one that, while very 
 
                     reasonable on its face, and in many situations clearly one 
 
                     that we would like to see enforced, can easily be perverted 
 
                     to serve unethical purposes. There is a history of such provisions 
 
                     in the codes of engineering societies being used to attack 
 
                     conscientious engineers pointing out serious wrongdoing by 
 
                     other engineers that threatened the public safety or welfare. 
 
                     You might refer to my book for examples. (I failed to prevent 
 
                     such a provision from being inserted in the IEEE code.) </p>
 
                   <p>10. While Principle 7 includes the words, &quot;treat all 
 
                     those with whom they work fairly&quot;, which certainly implies 
 
                     that discrimination on the basis of irrelevant factors is 
 
                     unethical, I believe that, particularly in a comprehensive 
 
                     code, this should be stated explicitly. This isdone well, 
 
                     I believe in item 8 of the IEEE code. ........................................
