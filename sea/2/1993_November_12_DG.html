       <p>Report to the Board of Governors of the IEEE Computer Society from
         the Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering
         as a Profession

   November 12,1993<br>
   1.0 Background</p>
       <p><br>
   On May 21, 1993, the IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors approved a motion
     (Appendix 1) to establish a steering committee for evaluating, planning,
     and coordinating actions related to establishing software engineering as
     a profession.
     The Board of Governors (BoG) also charged
   this committee to report on its initial plan and progress at the November 12,
   1993 Board of Governors meeting to be held in
   Santa Clara, California.<br>
   Pursuant to the motion of the BoG, President Aylor appointed Mario Barbacci
   as the chairman of the steering committee and discussed the constitution of
   the committee. The committee started to work in September of 1993 with 6 members
   (including President Aylor) and were joined
   later on by one additional members (Schneidewind).<br>
   Chairman Barbacci and President Aylor agreed that the November 12 deadline
   was too short for any definitive proposals to emerge from the group. In fact,
   they recognized that the magnitude of the task would require the coordinated
   activities of several task forces, with different assignments
   and schedules, which would require careful planning. They agreed instead that
   the steering committee would define a process and
   agenda for the working committees and task forces, to be appointed later.<br>
   The ACM is also interested in the issue of Software Engineering as a profession
   and, when the BoG action was announced, Stu Zweben volunteered to participate
   in the task force representing ACM. Thus, one of the issues in the background
   of the committee's discussions was inter-society
   cooperation and how to best take advantage of having the US professional computing
   societies working together. Appendix 2provides
   some additional information about the ACM interest. The committee conducted
   its business almost exclusively by electronic mail
   although there were a couple of occasions when a couple of committee members
   had the
   opportunity to have informal discussions.
   This process was continued up until the deadline, with the last meeting taking
   place on Monday, November 8, in Santa Clara, California
   (Aylor, Barbacci, Buckley, Schneidewind).<br>
   This report describes the initial set of conclusions and recommendations of
   the steering committee to the Board of Governors.</p>
       <p><br>
   2.0 Definitions</p>
       <p><br>
   As defined by Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary:<br>
   Profession: A calling requiring specialized knowledge and often long and intensive
   academic preparation; a principal calling, vocation or employment; the whole
   body of persons engaged in a calling.<br>
   Professional: (1) Relating to or characteristic of a profession; engaged in
   one of the learned professions; characterized by or conforming to the technical
   or ethical standards of a profession. (2) participating for gain or livelihood
   in an activity or field of endeavor often engaged in
   by amateurs; engaged in by persons receiving financial returns.<br>
   Professionalism: (1) The conduct aims or qualities that characterize or mark
   a profession or a professional person. (2) The following of a profession (as
   athletics) for gain or livelihood.<br>
   The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, Volume 12, page 536
   The Mcmillan Company &amp; The Free Press] states that the core criteria for
   a profession are:<br>
   (a) A requirement of formal training accompanied by some institutional mode
   of validating both the adequacy of the training and the competence of trained
   individuals,<br>
   (b) A requirement that skills in some form of the use of the training must
   be developed, and,<br>
   (e) the profession must have some means of making sure that such competence
   will be put to socially responsible uses.<br>
   These definitions suggest several interlocking components: (a) a set of individuals
   (b) their education (c) their technical and ethical standards (d) a profit
   or gain motive (Webster).<br>
   Many members of the ACM and the Computer Society consider themselves to be
   software engineering professionals. However, there are other associations of &quot;software
   professionals,&quot; albeit working
   on specialized domains (e.g., manufacturing). Thus, linking the.profession
   with membership in any particular society might be interpreted as self-serving
   or unduly restrictive. Furthermore, the dictionary says that amateurs often
   engage in the activity or field of endeavor. Using profit or financial gain
   as a defining characteristic of a software professional
   might be not useful, relevant, or fair. The Free Software Foundation (FSF)
   and people contributing software to
   the FSF have deeply felt beliefs on this issue, and a great deal of personal
   computer software is developed and made publicly available
   for free.<br>
   We decided to concentrate on (b) education and (c) technical and ethical standards.
   We agreed that it should be clear from the outset that we are not interested
   in &quot;selling&quot; memb erships or in excluding
   groups of people who believe software should be free. That is, it should not
   matter if a person is a member of any particular society, or charges for her
   work, but rather that the person has been appropriately educated, applies
   commonly accepted practices, and adheres to a professional code of conduct.<br>
   Focusing our concerns on these two issues is in the spirit of the definition
   of the term &quot;software engineering&quot; in IEEE Standard<br>
   610.12:<br>
   Software Engineering: (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable
   approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is,
   the application of engineering to software. (2) The study of approaches as
   is (1). This definition of software engineering
   focuses on acquisition and application of technical standards. It does not
   address the application of ethical standards.
   We will cover this issue later on with a specific recommendation.</p>
       <p><br>
   3.0 Recommendations<br>
   Based on these preliminary considerations, we agreed on the following recommendations:</p>
       <p><br>
   3.1 Recommendation 1: Adopt Standard Definitions<br>
   We recommend the adoption of a standard set of definitions. IEEE Standard 610.12
   is a good starting place. Other standard glossaries might be appropriate but
   in any event, these definitions should be carefully examined for appropriateness
   and scope. This task could he entrusted to the
   Standards Activities Board of the Computer Society and the appropriate Standards
   Subcommittee(s).</p>
       <p><br>
   3.2 Recommendation 2: Define Required Body of Knowledge and Recommended Practices<br>
   We recommend the identification of a required body of knowledge and recommended
   practices (in electrical engineering, for example, electromagnetic theory is
   part of the body of knowledge while the National Electrical Safety Code is
   a recommended practice.) The required body of knowledge
   and recommended practices are not static because tech nology evolves and the
   professional, should keep up with the field This
   activity should be entrusted to a task force of industry experts. Industry
   should lead the effort because employers know what their
   software engineers do well, poorly, or indifferently.<br>
   Adoption of new practices often requires cultural changes and these processes
   take years to accomplish. Thus, the initial set of recommended practices ought
   to be modest and easily achievable. The development and maintenance of the
   set of recommended practices should be structured like
   a technical standard: adopted by consensus and subject to periodic revision.<br>
   We should not confuse organizational practices with individual practices. Organizational
   maturity is already the subject of a healthy activity by Software Engineering
   Process Groups (SEPGs) and Software Process Improvement Networks SPINs). Industry
   is adopting standards to assess and improve
   organizational maturity (ISO 9000, SEI CMM) and we should capitalize on these
   developments but not confuse the issues.
   Engaging the process improvement groups might be unconventional but they provide
   leverage.
   The SEPGs are almost exclusively attended by industry
   practitioners
   concerned with organization software engineering practices and will have something
   to contribute to the definition of recommended
   individual practices.</p>
       <p><br>
   3.3 Recommendation 3: Define Ethical Standards<br>
   We recommend to study and customize, if necessary, existing codes already adopted
   by IEEE, ACM, registration boards, and other relevant organizations. It is
   not clear that we need something terribly different or specific to software
   on
   the grounds that the code of ethics of professionals
   building antennas, processors, or databases should be different. However, due
   perhaps to the rapid expansion of the field, software
   developers sometimes do things that might be considered unethical in other
   fields (e.g., indiscriminate copying of software in violation
   of copyrights or licenses.) This task should be charged to the Committee on
   Public Policy (COPP) of the Computer Society.</p>
       <p><br>
   3.4 Recommendation 4: Define Educational Curricula<br>
   We recommend the definition of curricula for (a) undergraduate, (b) graduate
   (MS), and (c) continuing education (for retraining and migration). This should
   be charged to an academic task force drawn from educational boards within the
   SEI, ACM and IEEE Computer Society, and relevant affiliate
   societies.<br>
   There is a debate as to whether Software Engineering is a part of Computer
   Science or vice versa. We should not be distracted by this debate from the
   goal of meeting the needs of industry. The education needed by competent software
   engineers could be acquired in different ways. For example,
   we might identify the need for a foundation on statistics; at a given school,
   the courses could be offered by Computer Science,
   Software Engineering, or other departments. The objective is to seek agreement
   on the curricula that should be taught and not necessarily
   on which departments teach it.</p>
       <p>4.0 Approach<br>
         To implement these recommendations we will establish and appoint working
             committees and task forces as necessary to accomplish the steering
             committee's work. The
     goal of the steering committee is to pose the questions, and consider and
             document the issues involved relating to establishing
     software engineering as a profession. As a part of this, the steering committee
     will identify the bodies of experts
     who can contribute to this effort.<br>
     Additional activities will include coordinating the work of the steering
     committee other with Computer Society boards and committees, other professional
     societies
     and other communities. Finally, we will organize and facilitate the debates
     so that the questions and issues are
     addressed in the appropriate settings and by the right audiences.<br>
     The process should be open to the full community. This requires early dissemination
     of proposals and engaging the appropriate communities. The following meetings
     are illustrative of suitable venues to gather inputs, identify concerns,
     and float trial balloons:<br>
     IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering, SEI Software Engineering
     Education Symposium, and National Software Engineering Process Groups (SEPG)
     meetings. These meeting are attended (in different ratios) by software practitioners,
     computer science and software
     engineering educators, and technology transition agents.</p>
       <p><br>
   5.0 Epilog<br>
   Our initial work will concentrate on definitions, education, and technical
   and ethical practices. The four recommendations listed above have implied dependencies
   and they should be implemented in the order suggested. In particular, it would
   be imprudent to develop a set of recommendations about
   curricula that turns out to be inconsistent with the required body of knowledge
   and recommended practices. The definition of
   the required body of knowledge and recommended practices should be driven by
   industry needs and should be developed first.
   We expect that the industry task force would include members from the academic
   community to provide an education/academic perspective
   to those discussions, but would not overemphasize the education area at the
   expense of the technical area. By the same token,
   the academic task force should include members from the industry community.<br>
   Licensing, certification, and other such regulatory instruments will be addressed
   next. This is a natural continuation to our first set of recommendations. Only
   after we identify i the required body of knowledge and recommended practices
   expected of competent software engineers we could suggest
   mechanisms to assess their level of competence<br>
   In our next report we will expand on all of these recommendations and will
   offer detailed plans and schedules to implement them.</p>

   Appendix 2<br>
   ACM Council Resolution (8/93)<br>
   As background for our discussion, Stu Zweben described actions taken at the
   August 1993 meeting of the ACM Council. In that meeting, the Council endorsed
   the establishment of a Commission on Software Engineering to address a number
   of questions relating to 1) the terminology
   used to describe software engineering and those who work in the software area;
   2) the identification of generally accepted and desired
   standards of good software practice; and 3) our ability to identify, educate,
   and train individuals who are competent with software
   engineering and design.<br>
 &quot;Council endorses the establishment of a Commission on Software Engineering
 to address the questions contained in Council backup, Item 3.7, Pages 3-4 of
 7.
 If possible, this activity shall be done jointly with the IEEE Computer Society.
 The Executive Committee shall appoint (ACM's)
   members of the commission, provide it with a reasonable expense budget, and
   take other steps as may be necessary to assure that the
   commission may complete its work in a timely fashion.&quot;</p>
       <p><br>
   The text of the material on pages 3-4 of 7 alluded to in the resolution reads
     as follows:<br>
   Draft 8 (SHZ) 7/15/93<br>
   ACM Commission on Software Engineering</p>
       <p><br>
   Background:<br>
   There are ongoing concerns about the persistent inability to construct software
   systems that are reliable, dependable, usable, on time, and within budget.
   These concerns are exacerbated by the widening reliance on computers and networks
   for conduct of all business and other human activities,
   and by the increasing role of software in supporting human activities of all
   kinds. The term &quot;software engineering&quot; is
   typically used to designate the broad field of study and practice that addresses
   these concerns. Terms such as &quot;software design&quot; and &quot;software
   architecture&quot; also have been used for
   this purpose, to. focus attention on important and fundamental questions that
   must be answered satisfactorily before good software can be built routinely.<br>
   ACM has a long history of interest in these concerns. A large fraction (about
   40%) of its members are professionally directly involved with software development.
   Through its SIGs (especially SIGSOFT and SIGCHI, and their newsletters and
   many conferences), publications (especially TOSEM,
   TOCHI, and the new INTERACTIONS), education activities (such as &quot;Computing
   as a Discipline&quot; and curriculum recommendations),
   and public policy activities (such as the RISKS forum), ACM plays a major role
   in defining the states of the art and
   practice of the broad software engineering field. ACM also has a long history
   of involvement
   and cooperation with IEEE-CS in many
   of these endeavors.<br>
   As Ills software engineering field matures and society places increasing demands
   and reliance on software systems, there is a need to increase the overall quality
   and reliability of these systems, to raise the level of responsibility and
   accountability of those who develop them, and to
   increase public confidence in them. Terms such as &quot;discipline&quot; and &quot;profession&quot; have
   been used to characterize software.engineering, and to argue for varying degrees
   of regulation for individuals in this field. At the same time, strong objections
   to these characterizations and to any regulatory efforts have been voiced.
   There are strong disagreements about whether software engineering is properly
   regarded
   as engineering, whether software engineering adequately covers all relevant
   aspects of design, whether software engineering should
   be separated from computer science, and whether software engineering is mature
   enough to be called a discipline. ACM therefore feels
   that the time is now ripe to assess where we are as a field with respect to
   software engineering. There is a strong need to clarify terminology,
   to identify both generally accepted and desirable standards of good software
   practice, and to further our ability to educate
   and train individuals to be competent with software engineering and design.</p>
       <p><br>
   Action:<br>
   The ACM chatters a Commission on Software Engineering to provide a white paper
   that assesses the field of software engineering relative to the issues raised
   above. The commission will address the following questions.<br>
   1 What activities are usually considered part of software engineering? How
   is design currently formulated within software<br>
   engineering? What other formulations of software design are in use? How can
   they be brought together?<br>
   2 What is a profession? What is the state of software engineering as a profession?<br>
   3 What is a discipline? What is the state of software engineering as a discipline?<br>
   4 What standard practices currently exist for software engineering? How do
   they compare with those in other fields recognized as disciplines or professions?<br>
   5 What responsibilities are generally expected of persons with the title of &quot;software
   engineer&quot;? &quot;Designer&quot;? &quot;Architect?&quot; Are there useful
   distinctions in the responsibilities of persons with related job titles?<br>
   6 What are the important issues to be confronted within the various sub areas
   of software engineering?<br>
   7 What are the implications of the above for education? Curriculum? Accreditation?<br>
   8 What are the implications of the above for certification? Licensing?<br>
   9 What actions are recommended for ACM?<br>
   The commission should include leading people from software engineering, academia,
   industry, and government. It should gather information from other knowledgeable
   groups and from related published material, and should cooperate with other
   organizations having an interest in similar questions.</p>
       <p><br>
   Due Date:<br>
   The Commission should complete its work by April 30, 1994.<br>
