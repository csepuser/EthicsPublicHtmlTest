                     ____________________________________________________________________<br>
 
                     Dear Members,</p>
 
                   <p> In this issue, I am very pleased to share with you the name 
 
                     of the
 
                     newly- appointed chair of our subcommittee on standards, David
 
                     Aucsmith. Dave, a security architect with the Intel Corp. 
 
                     in
 
                     Hillsboro, Oregon, brings great strength to our executive 
 
                     committee.
 
                     Clearly a company such as Intel is always heavily involved 
 
                     in setting
 
                     and making standards. Within the security realm, Dave has 
 
                     oversight of
 
                     activities involving cryptography, integrity, and secure data
 
                     communications. I think Dave will be an outstanding addition 
 
                     to our
 
                     executive committee, bringing both significant knowledge and 
 
                     an
 
                     industrial perspective. With this new addition to our executive
 
                     committee, I would like to take a moment to explain what our 
 
                     executive
 
                     committee is, and who are its members. With an organization 
 
                     with
 
                     approximately 2500 members (by IEEE Computer Society count), 
 
                     it is
 
                     difficult to get all, or a quorum, or even a significant fraction
 
                     together to conduct business on a frequent basis. Our annual 
 
                     meeting
 
                     held during the Symposium on Security and Privacy in May is 
 
                     the only
 
                     formal meeting we hold. Fortunately, most of our business 
 
                     is involved
 
                     in providing services for our members, so direction from the 
 
                     members is
 
                     not required frequently. However, a formal structure of
 
                     responsibilities and areas of concern, and a set of people 
 
                     to whom to
 
                     refer for a consensus opinion, make an executive committee 
 
                     very
 
                     desirable.</p>
 
                   <p> My predecessor as Chair, Deborah Cooper formalized what 
 
                     had until then
 
                     been an informal executive committee, with permanent positions 
 
                     for 
 
                     chairs of the subcommittees on conferences, academic affairs, 
 
                     communications, and standards, as well as the vice-chair and 
 
                     the 
 
                     immediate past chair. Tom Berson, our vice-chair is also chair-elect, 
 
                     to take office in 1999. Deborah Cooper served as chair from 
 
                     1995-1997 
 
                     and has been an invaluable source of guidance. The past chair, 
 
                     chair, 
 
                     and chair-elect constitute a very important corporate memory 
 
                     of our 
 
                     technical committee. The subcommittee chairs also serve significant 
 
                     functions in their own area. Our chair of conferences, Michael 
 
                     Reiter, 
 
                     is also the chair of our Symposium on Security and Privacy. 
 
                     Our chair 
 
                     of academic affairs is Cynthia Irvine. Our chair of communications 
 
                     is 
 
                     our newsletter editor, Carl Landwehr, who is soon to be replaced 
 
                     by 
 
                     Paul Syverson and Avi Rubin (see the other articles in this 
 
                     issue of 
 
                     Cipher). With Dave Aucsmith to round out our slate, we now 
 
                     have a 
 
                     complete executive committee. All of these people serve as 
 
                     unpaid 
 
                     volunteers, with only the thanks that we too infrequently 
 
                     give them. 
 
                     These officers, and their contact details, are listed on our 
 
                     technical 
 
                     committees web page at www.itd.nrl.navy.mil/ITD/5540/ieee/index.html

                     www.computer.org.</p>
 
                   <p> Remember that this organization is meant to help its members. 
 
                     If you 
 
                     can think of other things that we could do to help in the 
 
                     area of 
 
                     security and privacy, please contact either me or the appropriate 
 
                     subcommittee chair with your suggestion. And don't be surprised 
 
                     if you 
 
                     are invited to help implement your suggestion.</p>

                     Letter #2 from the TC Chair<br>
 
                     ____________________________________________________________________<br>
 
                     Dear Members,</p>
 
                   <p> You think about your electric service only when you turn 
 
                     on the switch 
 
                     and the light doesn't go on. Fortunately, for Cipher readers, 
 
                     the light 
 
                     has always gone on thanks (and without having been thanked) 
 
                     to Carl 
 
                     Landwehr. Carl has been our editor for more years than I can 
 
                     remember. And the highest compliment we can give Carl is that 
 
                     readers 
 
                     knew he was editor only by reading the electronic masthead. 
 
                     For you 
 
                     readers, Cipher just appeared; for those of us who contributed, 
 
                     the 
 
                     same was true.</p>
 
                   <p> It was Carl who brought us into the information age, first 
 
                     by 
 
                     distribution of Cipher by e-mail, and then, to save our mailboxes 
 
                     from 
 
                     overflow, by what he called the postcard distribution, in 
 
                     which he sent 
 
                     a brief e-mail message advising readers that a new edition 
 
                     had been 
 
                     posted at the web site. He maintained a mailing list of addresses 
 
                     that 
 
                     changed daily, as people changed affiliations and, more frequently, 
 
                     as 
 
                     organizations changed addressing conventions. He tirelessly 
 
                     repaired 
 
                     failed e-mail addresses in the best traditions of any postal 
 
                     service: 
 
                     the [e-]mail must get through.</p>
 
                   <p> Now, after long and faithful service, Carl has decided it 
 
                     is time for 
 
                     someone else to take over from him. And, as if to underscore 
 
                     the 
 
                     amount of work he has done for us, he will be replaced by 
 
                     not one but 
 
                     two editors: Avi Rubin of Bell Laboratories and Paul Syverson 
 
                     of the 
 
                     Naval Research Laboratory. These two have an extremely high 
 
                     standard 
 
                     to follow. Please join me in a heartfelt expression of thanks 
 
                     to Carl, 
 
                     and best wishes to our new editors.</p>

                     Letter from the Editor<br>
 
                     ____________________________________________________________________<br>
 
                     Dear Readers,</p>
 
                   <p> As you may already have discovered from Chuck's kind words 
 
                     above, this 
 
                     will be my last issue as Editor of Electronic Cipher. I enjoyed 
 
                     the 
 
                     opportunity to launch Cipher into the world of paperless distribution, 
 
                     but roughly three years and 25 issues later, I think it is 
 
                     time for 
 
                     some new blood. As a Cipher reader, you (and I) are fortunate 
 
                     to have 
 
                     two volunteers as capable as Paul Syverson and Avi Rubin willing 
 
                     to 
 
                     devote their time and creativity to keeping Cipher lively 
 
                     and current.</p>
 
                   <p> Cipher is not the product of one person; I expect there 
 
                     have been more 
 
                     than 50 contributors since we began electronic distribution. 
 
                     While I 
 
                     can't thank each of you individually, I do want to thank Hilarie 
 
                     Orman, 
 
                     Mary Ellen Zurko, Jim Davis, and Bob Bruen for their excellent 
 
                     and 
 
                     sustained efforts to make Cipher lively, up-to-date, and accurate. 
 
                     And 
 
                     I would also like to thank Terri Benzel, Deb Cooper, and Chuck 
 
                     Pfleeger 
 
                     for their support as TC officers.</p>
 
                   <p> Paul and Avi plan to bring out their first issue towards 
 
                     the end of 
 
                     January or in early February, and in the meantime I will be 
 
                     working 
 
                     with them to ease the transition. I plan to continue to contribute 
 
                     to 
 
                     Cipher, and I hope you will, too.</p>

                     President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection<br>
 
                     Warns of Vulnerabilities, Calls for Action<br>
 
                     ____________________________________________________________________<br>
 
                     The President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection 
 
                     (see 
 
                     Cipher EI#16, July 28, 1996), the unclassified version of 
 
                     its report in 
 
                     late October, generating considerable press coverage and discussion. 
 
                     The New York Times quoted the commission's chair, Gen. Robert 
 
                     (Tom) 
 
                     March, retired, of the Air Force, as calling attention to 
 
                     the need for 
 
                     the government's computer networks to be the benchmark by 
 
                     which the 
 
                     nation's digital security is measured. He also called attention 
 
                     to the 
 
                     threat from insiders: &quot;You can have good firewalls, good 
 
                     password 
 
                     control, but if you have an insider who intends to do harm, 
 
                     he can 
 
                     bypass many of these good safeguards.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p> Some advocates of relaxing controls on the export of strong 
 
                     encryption 
 
                     were disappointed that the commission did not go further in 
 
                     recognizing 
 
                     the defensive uses of cryptography. Others responded that 
 
                     &quot;the 
 
                     Commission properly spoke to cryptography in the context of 
 
                     its 
 
                     assigned task; namely, protecting the critical infrastructure. 
 
                     Equally 
 
                     properly, it did not -- and should not -- address cryptography 
 
                     as a 
 
                     national policy issue. The latter debate belongs elsewhere 
 
                     and it is 
 
                     elsewhere.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p> The report also called for the government and private sector 
 
                     to share 
 
                     responsibility for improving the resilience of the nation's 
 
                     infrastructures. This brought criticisms from some industry 
 
                     representatives that &quot;shared responsibility is a code 
 
                     word for 'You are 
 
                     going to pay for it.'&quot;</p>

                     IETF forms S/MIME Working Group<br>
 
                     ____________________________________________________________________<br>
 
                     Secure Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions, or S/MIME, 
 
                     gained 
 
                     momentum as a standard for secure e-mail as RSA re-submitted 
 
                     it to the 
 
                     IETF on 3 November, and the IETF formed an S/MIME working 
 
                     group chaired 
 
                     by Russ Housley on 7 November. From the charter:</p>
 
                   <p> The S/MIME Working Group will define MIME encapsulation 
 
                     of 
 
                     digitally signed and encrypted objects whose format is based 
 
                     on 
 
                     PKCS #7. [1] X.509 Certificates and CRLs as profiled by the 
 
                     existing PKIX Working Group will be used to support authentication 
 
                     and key management. The Working Group will base its work on 
 
                     the 
 
                     S/MIME version 2 specification (available from RSA Data Security), 
 
                     but the Working Group will be free to change any part of that 
 
                     specification. In particular, the Working Group will prepare 
 
                     a new 
 
                     document that allows algorithm independence, based on PKCS 
 
                     #7 
 
                     1.5.</p>
 
                   <p> The creation of the working group followed RSA's agreement 
 
                     to renounce 
 
                     its rights to ownership of the technology and trademark, according 
 
                     to 
 
                     an article by Elinor Mills of the IDG News Service published 
 
                     in Network 
 
                     World Fusion. RSA also announced a new consortium of 12 manufacturers, 
 
                     resellers, and distributors in Japan, as well as an effort 
 
                     to merge 
 
                     S/MIME with the Message Security Protocol (MSP) developed 
 
                     by the U.S. 
 
                     Dept. of Defense.</p>
 
                   <p> The IETF's working group on Open PGP, co-chaired by John 
 
                     Noerenberg and 
 
                     Charles Breed, which is to develop a MIME framework for exchanging 
 
                     &quot;PGP-processed objects&quot; via e-mail and other transport 
 
                     protocols

                     Among the news reports of attacks, flaws, and penetrations 
 
                     since the 
 
                     last issue of Cipher were the following:</p>
 
                   <p> * October 15: Microsoft confirmed a security flaw in Windows 
 
                     NT 
 
                     registry system that could permit an NT user to perform 
 
                     unauthorized software installations. According to an article 
 
                     in 
 
                     Infoworld, the problem was reported by David LeBlanc of Internet 
 
                     Security Systems. Microsoft has posted an article about the 
 
                     flaw 
 
                     at 
 
                     http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q126/7/13.asp. 
 
                     * October 17, November 4, November 11, and November 21 were 
 
                     the 
 
                     dates on which Microsoft posted successive security fixes 
 
                     for 
 
                     different security problems in Internet Explorer 4.0 identified 
 
                     by 
 
                     users worldwide; see 
 
                     http://www.microsoft.com/ie/security<br>
 
                     * October 20: NASA report that ground systems supporting e-mail<br>
 
                     communications with the space station Mir were infected with 
 
                     a<br>
 
                     macro virus. In addition, a web server at the Johnson Space 
 
                     Flight<br>
 
                     Center was shut down and all passwords were reset after they<br>
 
                     learned a password file might have been compromised. In a 
 
                     separate 
 
                     incident, a NIST spokesperson reported that,following an anonymous 
 
                     tip, a password sniffer was discovered and removed from a 
 
                     NIST 
 
                     system.<br>
 
                     * November 10: Government Computer News reports that organizers 
 
                     of a Federal Web conference had misconfigured a Lotus Notes<br>
 
                     database and inadvertently exposed credit card information 
 
                     on an 
 
                     open web site.<br>
 
                     * November 10: Security issues in cable modem systems such 
 
                     as those 
 
                     being marketed by @Home Network were the subject of an article 
 
                     in 
 
                     Infoworld. A California subscriber to @Home's service discovered 
 
                     that he could, with a few mouse clicks, gain information from 
 
                     computers located in about 150 remote systems listed in the 
 
                     Network Neighborhood.<br>
 
                     * November 17: An article in Government Computer News reported 
 
                     that 
 
                     a citizen of the People's Republic of China working for a 
 
                     contractor to the U.S. Air Force had, more than a year ago, 
 
                     stolen 
 
                     passwords for an unclassified computer system, copied them, 
 
                     and 
 
                     posted them on the Internet. Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan, director 
 
                     of 
 
                     the National Security Agency, revealed that more than 250 
 
                     Defense 
 
                     Department systems were penetrated last year, and that that 
 
                     number 
 
                     is expected to double this year, according to a separate GCN 
 
                     report.<br>

                     Better DNS Security Coming?<br>
 
                     ____________________________________________________________________<br>
 
                     RSA Data Security, Inc. and the Internet Software Consortium 
 
                     announced<br>
 
                     an agreement providing ISC with a free license for DNSsafe, 
 
                     an 
 
                     implementation of the RSA cryptosystem, limited for use only 
 
                     in 
 
                     authenticating Domain Name System resource records</p>
 
                   <p> According to a widely distributed e-mail message from Carl 
 
                     Malamad,</p>
 
                   <p> The donation allows the implementation of the DNS Security 
 
                     standards in BIND, a publicly-available implementation of 
 
                     the 
 
                     Domain Name System. RSA has also agreed to offer the same 
 
                     license 
 
                     to other DNS developers for a three-year period, so that 
 
                     non-BIND-based DNS products can also be secured. Virtually 
 
                     every 
 
                     device on the Internet currently implements the existing 
 
                     (insecure) DNS. We believe the DNSsafe security engine will 
 
                     be 
 
                     embedded in a wide variety of products, including routers 
 
                     and 
 
                     firewalls, and we hope that eventually Secure DNS will appear 
 
                     in 
 
                     every device on the Internet.<br>

                     following announcement on 1 November:</p>
 
                   <p> The Annual COMPuter ASSurance (COMPASS) Conference, that 
 
                     has been 
 
                     held yearly at NIST in Gaithersburg, MD, and is sponsored 
 
                     by the 
 
                     IEEE National Capital Area and the IEEE Aerospace and Electronic 
 
                     System Society will not be held in 1998. On September 15, 
 
                     1997 the 
 
                     COMPASS Board of Directors passed a motion to pursue becoming 
 
                     a 
 
                     Technical Committee (TC) under the IEEE Computer Society. 
 
                     The 
 
                     former Board of Directors, which is now the Interim COMPASS 
 
                     Task 
 
                     Force, is currently preparing a formal request to the IEEE<br>
 
                     Computer Society for this to occur.</p>
 
                   <p> If this request is granted, then the newly formed Technical<br>
 
                     Committee will have the authority to hold future conferences. 
 
                     The 
 
                     earliest that these conferences could be held is 1999. It 
 
                     is 
 
                     anticipated that the new COMPASS conference(s) will be held 
 
                     in new 
 
                     locations and will remain focused on the principles of software 
 
                     assurance. Building systems with assurance and measuring that 
 
                     assurance will remain in the mission statement and charter 
 
                     of this 
 
                     new organization as fundamental goals.</p>
 
                   <p> After twelve years of serving the information systems community, 
 
                     the Board of Directors felt that it was time to freshen and 
 
                     revamp 
 
                     the COMPASS organization (which began its mission in the 
 
                     mid-1980s). By doing this, the software community will be 
 
                     better 
 
                     served with information and events that are more in line with 
 
                     problems that researchers, practitioners, and theorists are 
 
                     facing 
 
                     as we near the close of this century. Interested parties in 
 
                     participating in the Technical Committee should contact Bonnie 
 
                     Danner at bonnie.danner@faa.dot.gov.<br>

                     Summers has divided the book into four parts: (1) Foundations, 
 
                     (2)<br>
 
                     Methods (3) Security in Computer Networks and (4) Management 
 
                     and<br>
 
                     Analysis. These parts provide the outline for a well organized<br>
 
                     presentation, balanced between technical topics such as cryptography 
 
                     and management topics such as policy. She has done an excellent 
 
                     job in 
 
                     both areas, not as common a feat as one would like. Her information 
 
                     theory and models based discussions of policy are clear and 
 
                     precise, as 
 
                     are the comprehensive descriptions of cryptographic methods 
 
                     (yes, she 
 
                     defines the terms cryptology and cryptanalysis as well).</p>
 
                   <p> The book works as a handbook for technology managers, as 
 
                     a textbook and 
 
                     as a good book to read about computer security. In spite of 
 
                     the 
 
                     comprehensive approach, there is generally enough detail in 
 
                     each 
 
                     subject to get a good grasp of each idea. She has summarize 
 
                     instead of 
 
                     glossed over ideas, making sure there are plenty of pointers 
 
                     if you 
 
                     want to expand your knowledge. The bibliographies and references 
 
                     are 
 
                     extensive, indicating the research done for the book. A security 
 
                     professional might like to see more detail in the individual 
 
                     sections, 
 
                     but there will not be any complaints about how thorough she 
 
                     has been.</p>
 
                   <p> Foundations includes a good introduction, a helpful chapter 
 
                     on the 
 
                     context in which we find computer security, a chapter on threats 
 
                     and 
 
                     the fourth chapter is about policies and models. For most 
 
                     computer 
 
                     managers, threats seen to come from everywhere, but Summers 
 
                     helps to 
 
                     narrow it down. The policy chapter is really a gem. She goes 
 
                     past the 
 
                     usual problem of trying to convince management to pay for 
 
                     it into the 
 
                     technical basis of integrity and several theoretical models.</p>
 
                   <p> Methods is almost half the book, covering cryptography, 
 
                     designing and 
 
                     building secure systems, protection mechanisms, operating 
 
                     systems 
 
                     security, and database security. The database chapter is up 
 
                     to date 
 
                     with a section on object oriented databases. The operating 
 
                     systems 
 
                     chapter covers principles about built in OS security, then 
 
                     looks at 
 
                     commercial operating systems, such Unix, MVS, VMS, NT, etc, 
 
                     with a 
 
                     slight bias toward MVS, but then she did spend some time at 
 
                     IBM working 
 
                     on security.</p>
 
                   <p> Network security is separated into basic network security 
 
                     and 
 
                     distributed systems. These are straight forward and well covered. 
 
                     Novell Netware has its own section, as does distributed file 
 
                     systems, 
 
                     remote access and mobile computing. Kerberos is covered as 
 
                     part of the 
 
                     section on authentication, but there are other aspects of 
 
                     authentication as well.</p>
 
                   <p> Management and analysis has a chapter on each topic. Management 
 
                     covers 
 
                     the job that needs to be done, the organization, employees, 
 
                     contingency 
 
                     planning and incident response. In analysis, we find risk 
 
                     analysis, 
 
                     auditing, vulnerability testing and intrusion detection. Through 
 
                     these 
 
                     chapters we have step by step methods, examples, techniques 
 
                     and 
 
                     financial considerations. If you are new to this field, you 
 
                     will not 
 
                     miss much if you follow her advice. If you are experienced, 
 
                     you might 
 
                     be reminded of something to pay attention to.</p>
 
                   <p> This a valuable resource from an experienced security professional 
 
                     who 
 
                     knows how to write. Recommended reading.<br>

                     &quot;Privacy is the capacity to negotiate social relationships 
 
                     by<br>
 
                     controlling access to information about oneself&quot; (from 
 
                     the dust jacket)<br>
 
                     is a far cry from privacy as the &quot;right to be let alone&quot; 
 
                     as described 
 
                     by Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren in their 1890 landmark 
 
                     paper &quot;The 
 
                     Right to Privacy.&quot; But 107 years later the issue of privacy 
 
                     has moved 
 
                     just as far or even farther. In fact, in the past decade the 
 
                     issue has 
 
                     moved as far as in the last 100 years, mainly as a consequence 
 
                     of 
 
                     technology. As with the usual advances in technology, information 
 
                     moves 
 
                     faster, gets collected in larger quantities and is analyzed 
 
                     in more 
 
                     detail. This excellent collection of papers is right on the 
 
                     mark 
 
                     presenting the policy problem from various vantage points. 
 
                     Almost all 
 
                     the papers have useful references in the form of endnotes 
 
                     or 
 
                     bibliographies.</p>
 
                   <p> Agre's introduction starts off listing all the things the 
 
                     book is not, 
 
                     such as a source for genetic, medical, international, etc. 
 
                     privacy 
 
                     issues. Privacy is a big area for which there are other books 
 
                     that 
 
                     cover these issues. The New Landscape attempts to help &quot;frame 
 
                     the new 
 
                     policy debate,&quot; which I think it does. The introduction 
 
                     not only 
 
                     summarizes the papers in the book, but also provides good 
 
                     insight into 
 
                     each topic.</p>
 
                   <p> What I took away from the book was a sense that the issues 
 
                     are 
 
                     international with important differences in approaches from 
 
                     the US. One 
 
                     can not ignore the potential difficulties inherent in fundamental 
 
                     approaches to privacy between our closet world partners in 
 
                     Canada and 
 
                     Europe. Nor can one ignore the potential threats in the Internet's 
 
                     lack 
 
                     of respect for international boundaries. The death of privacy 
 
                     was 
 
                     declared by Time Magazine on August 25 of this year, but since 
 
                     it was 
 
                     at the personal level we need to also look at the larger consequences 
 
                     at the international policy level. There are no end to the 
 
                     sources of 
 
                     problems as technology not only gets better, but more of it 
 
                     gets into 
 
                     the hands of more people. For what it is worth, people are 
 
                     pretty much 
 
                     the same. Technology just gives them better tools to do whatever 
 
                     it is 
 
                     that they do. A quick look at history shows a mixed bag of 
 
                     good, bad 
 
                     and indifferent.</p>
 
                   <p> While the range of the New Landscape is intended to be somewhat 
 
                     narrow, 
 
                     there is a still a broad enough range in the papers to be 
 
                     interesting 
 
                     and balanced. The best chapter is Cryptography, Secrets and 
 
                     Trust by 
 
                     David Phillips. The crypto summary was well done and interesting, 
 
                     but I 
 
                     especially liked his discussion of the structure of trust. 
 
                     He sets up a 
 
                     good baseline that makes the jump from technology to policy. 
 
                     His 
 
                     references contain the right choices for such a paper. He 
 
                     did not say 
 
                     it, be he gives cause for concern that not only will privacy 
 
                     disappear, 
 
                     but so will trust as we understand it.</p>
 
                   <p> Burkert's paper on privacy enhancing technologies (PET) 
 
                     provides 
 
                     another dimension in which personal identity is protected. 
 
                     He first 
 
                     lays out a starting point for a typology of interactions that 
 
                     could be 
 
                     subject to protections by technology, then critiques PET design 
 
                     as it 
 
                     exists today. The problems raised by him are well worth thinking 
 
                     about: 
 
                     anonymity, trust and identity.</p>
 
                   <p> The papers by Bennett, Davies and Mayer-Schonberg cover 
 
                     Europe in a 
 
                     helpful way. Europe's approach overall is to provide better 
 
                     individual 
 
                     privacy protection than the US where private information is 
 
                     a commodity 
 
                     to be bought and sold, which gives rise to strange notion 
 
                     that the 
 
                     right to privacy can be a commodity as well. Even though Europe 
 
                     is 
 
                     working towards a coherent privacy approach, the usual local 
 
                     differences are still making it a rocky road for them.</p>
 
                   <p> The Canadian contributions are from Flaherty and Samarajiva, 
 
                     both of 
 
                     which emphasize surveillance. Flaherty is an academic who 
 
                     became the 
 
                     first Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia. 
 
                     He 
 
                     offers a unique perspective on the rules are being written 
 
                     today. He is 
 
                     critical of the US approach because the federal government 
 
                     seems to 
 
                     prefer being sued to making any real progress over taking 
 
                     the 
 
                     initiative to protect its citizens.</p>
 
                   <p> Samarajiva's paper discusses a project in Quebec called 
 
                     UBI (Universal, 
 
                     Bidirectional, Interactivity) which intends to create an electronic 
 
                     mall providing commercial services to the homes of subscribers. 
 
                     The 
 
                     service will be free to subscribers, but information will 
 
                     be easily 
 
                     collected about buying habits. The fears of private industry's 
 
                     surveillance should surpass those of government surveillance.</p>
 
                   <p> Bellotti's paper is also about surveillance in private industry 
 
                     at 
 
                     Apple. The work was done as research about how visual media 
 
                     affects 
 
                     people. Some of the first attempts seem clumsy, as in the 
 
                     public coffee 
 
                     stand and some of the attempts seem successful as in offices 
 
                     where 
 
                     users have some control.</p>
 
                   <p> Surveillance generally brings about thoughts of illegal 
 
                     activity, but 
 
                     as shown by this book, there is a fair amount of surveillance 
 
                     of legal 
 
                     and sometimes uninteresting activity. The law has its due 
 
                     in Gellman's 
 
                     paper which asks if it works. Privacy law does exist in the 
 
                     US, but it 
 
                     is a patchwork that is constantly under attack. How many people 
 
                     realize 
 
                     that the infamous &quot;Deadbeat Dads&quot; law passed in 
 
                     1996 gave the FBI 
 
                     permission to gather up data on every person who gets a new 
 
                     job after 
 
                     October 1, 1997? Remember the CDA? Gellman does a good presenting 
 
                     some 
 
                     history as he tries to answer his question.</p>
 
                   <p> Lastly, Agre's chapter on the Mirror World is an historical 
 
                     look at 
 
                     privacy and PETs going back to the 1910 then progressing to 
 
                     today. He 
 
                     demonstrates effectively how the thinking of pre-computing 
 
                     days has 
 
                     been passed down to our current thinking and why it is important 
 
                     to 
 
                     understand it.</p>
 
                   <p> This is a well constructed, interesting and useful book. 
 
                     It helps to 
 
                     expand the notion the all that matters is the technical side 
 
                     of things 
 
                     to a more properly balanced approach that includes policy 
 
                     making and 
 
                     social change. Definitely recommended.<br>

                     New Security Paradigms Workshop '97 was held this year in 
 
                     Langdale,<br>
 
                     Cumbria, England, from September 23 - September 26. The goal 
 
                     of the<br>
 
                     workshop is to provide a highly interactive and supportive 
 
                     forum for<br>
 
                     brand new and radically different work in computer security. 
 
                     NSPW is<br>
 
                     an invitation-only workshop, generally restricted to accepted 
 
                     authors, 
 
                     organizers, and sponsors. It's home page is

                   <p> Session 1 was on &quot;Formalism and Pragmatism,&quot; and 
 
                     run by Hilary Hosmer, 
 
                     who founded the workshop. The first paper was &quot;Integrating 
 
                     Formalism 
 
                     and Pragmatism: Architectural Security&quot; by Ruth Nelson. 
 
                     Ruth was 
 
                     motivated by her perception that nobody listens to security 
 
                     people. She suggested we can change that, by focusing on things 
 
                     that 
 
                     matter to the world, and not just to us. While correctness 
 
                     is a really 
 
                     handy thing to worry about, universality is hard: to get the 
 
                     world 
 
                     right is difficult. She categorized security people as either 
 
                     formalists who mostly access control or pragmatists who mostly 
 
                     worry 
 
                     about intrusion detection. Neither school has great effect 
 
                     on system 
 
                     design. Someone suggested that penetrate and patch had an 
 
                     influence on 
 
                     system design by making systems like Java more complex (and 
 
                     hence 
 
                     worse). Ruth had several possible solutions to these 
 
                     problems. Architects can be intermediaries between the specific 
 
                     and 
 
                     general. We could work on general but not necessarily universal 
 
                     countermeasures. We can try to get more input from the real 
 
                     world 
 
                     (such as from system manager). We shouldn't buy into any one 
 
                     model of 
 
                     the world, because the bad guys don't have to. Instead of 
 
                     discussing 
 
                     issues with jargon (which is good for hiding structure and 
 
                     information) we should discuss things in pidgins and creoles 
 
                     (inter-languages). We can take a risk-based approach and work 
 
                     with 
 
                     attacks and countermeasures. We can include actual users within 
 
                     the 
 
                     boundary of the systems we're designing. There is a tension 
 
                     with 
 
                     security work. Security people come from the &quot;don't do 
 
                     this&quot; 
 
                     direction; functionality people come from the &quot;do do 
 
                     this&quot; direction.</p>
 
                   <p> The second paper was &quot;A Practical Approach to Computer 
 
                     Security&quot; by 
 
                     Darrell M. Kienzle and William A. Wulf. Darrell presented. 
 
                     The 
 
                     security people working on the Legion system needed a practical 
 
                     approach to evaluating security. It needed a minimal learning 
 
                     curve 
 
                     and had to allow formality to applied incrementally, where 
 
                     it was most 
 
                     useful. The goal was to give the user (the Legion application 
 
                     writer) 
 
                     the information to make the decision about whether the system 
 
                     is 
 
                     secure enough. They used system fault trees as the basis of 
 
                     their 
 
                     approach to produce Methodically Organized Argument Tree (MOAT). 
 
                     They 
 
                     produce a tree of uninterpreted predicates that are combined 
 
                     with AND 
 
                     or OR gates. Arguments are accessible and amenable to 
 
                     discussion/inspection. Further refinements of the trees go 
 
                     after the 
 
                     next weakest link in the arguments or the node that seems 
 
                     to have the 
 
                     best benefit/cost ratio. Chenxi Wang is doing research on 
 
                     assigning 
 
                     numbers to the nodes and composing them. One much discussed 
 
                     aspect of 
 
                     the work was that it chose a tree representation instead of 
 
                     a 
 
                     graph. It is trying to represent a formal argument. The results 
 
                     from 
 
                     using this method with Legion were that it was inexpensive, 
 
                     formality 
 
                     proved unnecessary, and they benefited from some reuse. It 
 
                     provided a 
 
                     systematic approach to trade-offs, aided problem understanding, 
 
                     and 
 
                     uncovered implicit assumptions. It aided communication in 
 
                     that 
 
                     arguments were accessible to inspection and assumptions were 
 
                     well 
 
                     communicated. They need tools to manage larger analyses; the 
 
                     gestalt 
 
                     approach begins to break down as the system scales up. Dixie 
 
                     Baker 
 
                     suggested that this approach also needs to communicate to 
 
                     the<br>
 
                     customers how much risk is left.</p>
 
                   <p> Session 2, on &quot;Protection,&quot; was chaired by Steven 
 
                     Greenwald. The first<br>
 
                     paper in that session was &quot;Meta Objects for Access Control: 
 
                     Extending 
 
                     Capability-Based Security&quot; by Thomas Riechmann and Franz 
 
                     J. Hauck. Thomas presented. Their work was in a distributed, 
 
                     object-oriented system where an object reference is already 
 
                     a 
 
                     capability (controlled by the system and necessary and sufficient 
 
                     for 
 
                     calling an object). Their Security Meta Objects place restrictions 
 
                     on 
 
                     these capabilities. They are fully programmable, so can be 
 
                     used for 
 
                     policies involving revocation and expiration. Bob Blakley 
 
                     pointed out 
 
                     that you can encode policy that changes member functions to 
 
                     return 
 
                     different values for different policy states. These SMOs can 
 
                     apply 
 
                     policy to references that are returned from calls to methods 
 
                     they 
 
                     point to, or simply disallow their return. This approach encourages 
 
                     library reuse allowing object classes to be security unaware. 
 
                     SMOs 
 
                     also work when their reference is passed as a parameter to 
 
                     a method on 
 
                     an untrusted object. One future direction mentioned was to 
 
                     integrate 
 
                     ACLs and principals into SMOs. They are implementing their 
 
                     work in a 
 
                     Java prototype. Bob Blakley pointed out that Java can turn 
 
                     references 
 
                     into strings, then back into references, which would circumvent 
 
                     this 
 
                     approach.</p>
 
                   <p> The next paper was &quot;A Tentative Approach to Constructing 
 
                     Tamper-Resistant Software&quot; by Takanori Murayam, Masahiro 
 
                     Mambo, and 
 
                     Eiji Okamoto. Masahiro presented. They are working on defining 
 
                     tamper 
 
                     resistance as information stored in a device or software that 
 
                     is hard 
 
                     to read or modify by tampering. In terms of cost vs. performance 
 
                     and 
 
                     ease of handling, it is better to achieve tamper resistance 
 
                     without 
 
                     using any physical device. They are starting by making programs 
 
                     hard 
 
                     to analyze, so that it is uneconomic to guess the algorithm 
 
                     and 
 
                     impractical to guess the place in the module of a given piece 
 
                     of 
 
                     functionality. They attempted to generate hard to analyze 
 
                     programs 
 
                     without modifying the original algorithm (one attendee suggested 
 
                     they 
 
                     could hire some programmers who wrote spaghetti code that 
 
                     was hard to 
 
                     understand). Their basic techniques to generate elementary 
 
                     tamper-resistant code are irregularly order the instruction 
 
                     streams, 
 
                     insert dummy codes, eliminate useful patterns and redundancy 
 
                     via 
 
                     optimization. Heather Hinton pointed out that their method 
 
                     of turning 
 
                     two lines of assembly language into nine would produce a significant 
 
                     size issue. Bob Blakley suggested looking over the obfuscated 
 
                     C 
 
                     handbook to see how to do things like this without unreasonable 
 
                     code 
 
                     expansion. Another concern was that if this process can be 
 
                     automated, 
 
                     then it can be undone by an automated process.</p>
 
                   <p> Session 3, &quot;Design of Secure Systems,&quot; was run 
 
                     by Cathy Meadows, who 
 
                     authored the paper &quot;Three Paradigms in Computer Security&quot; 
 
                     that was 
 
                     used as a touchstone for this discussion session. Her paper 
 
                     was 
 
                     inspired by a panel she was on last year called &quot;High 
 
                     Assurance 
 
                     Systems: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.&quot; The Ugly are 
 
                     solutions that 
 
                     are practical but messy and of doubtful assurance (like most 
 
                     things in 
 
                     the world). Cathy suggested that firewalls and virus checkers 
 
                     fall in 
 
                     this category. The Bad are sound but impractical solutions 
 
                     (the Orange 
 
                     Book being a favorite example). The Good are sound and practical 
 
                     solutions, such as connecting system high computers at different 
 
                     security levels via one-way flow devices. Cathy's conjecture 
 
                     about 
 
                     what makes the difference between these approaches is in the 
 
                     attitude 
 
                     to existing infrastructure. Cathy proposes three paradigms 
 
                     based on 
 
                     this conjecture: Live With It (Ugly), Replace It (Bad), and 
 
                     Extend It 
 
                     (Good). The Live With It Paradigm takes the infrastructure 
 
                     as a given 
 
                     and applies security patches without modifying or extending 
 
                     the 
 
                     underlying structure. The Replace It Paradigm states &quot;Replace 
 
                     X with a 
 
                     secure X&quot; while ignoring entrenchment of X. The Extend 
 
                     It Paradigm 
 
                     pays close attention to infrastructure. It identifies necessary 
 
                     modifications, but keeps them to a minimum. Adding components 
 
                     to the 
 
                     infrastructure is usually better than trying to replace them. 
 
                     One 
 
                     question that received much discussion was &quot;How do we 
 
                     distinguish 
 
                     between the different paradigms?&quot;, particularly between 
 
                     Live With It 
 
                     and Extend It. Extend It seems easiest to apply when a function 
 
                     does 
 
                     not yet exist or is inadequate. I pointed out that Digital's 
 
                     A1 
 
                     Virtual Machine Monitor overcame the Replace It issues, but 
 
                     died for 
 
                     other reasons, so that following the Extend It paradigm might 
 
                     be 
 
                     necessary, but not sufficient. One participant suggested coming 
 
                     up 
 
                     with a problem architecture before coming up with the solution 
 
                     architecture.</p>
 
                   <p> Session 4, &quot;Trust and Distrust,&quot; was chaired by 
 
                     Marv Schaefer. The 
 
                     first paper was &quot;Patterns of Trust and Distrust&quot; 
 
                     by Daniel Essin. Dan 
 
                     took a look at policies in the context of a service organization 
 
                     such 
 
                     as a hospital, where high quality work is the goal. Activities 
 
                     are 
 
                     highly regulated and there is a potential for catastrophic 
 
                     loss. Many 
 
                     tasks have a specification and require permission (not just 
 
                     data 
 
                     system tasks). Each component of an individual's work may 
 
                     be governed 
 
                     by different policies and permissions. For example, the organization 
 
                     may suspend the privileges to do elective surgery, but in 
 
                     an emergency 
 
                     they may be temporarily granted, if the suspension was due 
 
                     to 
 
                     non-compliance with administrative policy. The nature of the 
 
                     task and 
 
                     the circumstances may affect the decision to allow the action 
 
                     and the 
 
                     evaluation of its deliverables. There is no training on how 
 
                     to make 
 
                     policy; it's assumed people who can breathe can make policy. 
 
                     The 
 
                     number of policies defined goes up while the number carried 
 
                     out 
 
                     remains flat. One of the many questions raised was &quot;How 
 
                     do you 
 
                     determine in retrospect what the situation was so that you 
 
                     can be sure 
 
                     that the right policy was applied?&quot;. It hinges on having 
 
                     a detailed, 
 
                     contemporaneous record. Actors motivation is to have as few 
 
                     policies 
 
                     as possible so they only need to be held to as few as possible. 
 
                     Trust 
 
                     represents a conclusion about whether an outcome will be positively 
 
                     affected by allowing an actor to interact with resources in 
 
                     the 
 
                     context of the risks involved. John Dobson pointed out that 
 
                     policy 
 
                     making is not a rational act; it's a visible manifestation 
 
                     of the 
 
                     exercise of power.</p>
 
                   <p> The next paper was &quot;A Distributed Trust Model&quot; 
 
                     by Alfarez Abdul-Rahman 
 
                     and Stephen Hailes. Farez presented. He quoted Diego Gambetta, 
 
                     a 
 
                     sociologist, from Can We Trust Trust?, &quot;trust ... is 
 
                     a particular 
 
                     level of the subjective probability with which an agent will 
 
                     perform a 
 
                     particular action, both before [we] can monitor such action 
 
                     ... and in 
 
                     a context in which it affects [our] own action.&quot; This 
 
                     points out that 
 
                     trust is subjective and contingent on the uncertainty of a 
 
                     future 
 
                     outcome. Another quote states &quot;Human interaction would 
 
                     be impossible 
 
                     without trust.&quot; Trust is made necessary by a lack of 
 
                     knowledge. Their 
 
                     approach is a generalization of existing approaches. Agents 
 
                     exchange 
 
                     (recommend) reputation information about other agents. The 
 
                     'quality' 
 
                     of the information depends on the recommender's reputation. 
 
                     While 
 
                     Farez stated that managing your own policy is a downside to 
 
                     recommendation-based trust, many of the attendees disagreed, 
 
                     and 
 
                     considered it to be necessary (even full delegation was considered 
 
                     self management). Chenxi Wang stated that recommendation works 
 
                     well in 
 
                     a contract based society but not in a reputation based society 
 
                     like 
 
                     China or Russia. John Dobson pointed out that evidence from 
 
                     psychological studies showed that trust is not even partially 
 
                     ordered, 
 
                     and that you can change your amount of trust without any evidence. 
 
                     Ian 
 
                     Welch suggested the notion of back flow; if A recommends B, 
 
                     and B 
 
                     stings me, I don't trust A or B. Marv Schaefer pointed out 
 
                     that B 
 
                     could undermine A on purpose this way. Ruth Nelson noted that 
 
                     tracking 
 
                     who to refresh (trust values are refreshed by their recommenders) 
 
                     is 
 
                     unwieldy.</p>
 
                   <p> The last paper in this session was &quot;An Insecurity Flow 
 
                     Model&quot; by Ira 
 
                     S. Moskowitz and Myong H. Kang. Ira presented. Ira started 
 
                     by listing 
 
                     the issues and assumptions not covered by this work: it's 
 
                     insecurity 
 
                     flow, not information flow; time is not considered; the model 
 
                     cares 
 
                     about the invader getting in, not about anything getting out; 
 
                     the 
 
                     model does not address if you know if anyone gets in; and 
 
                     all &quot;layers&quot; 
 
                     are independent (this simplifies the current model, though 
 
                     it is a 
 
                     very major assumption). Their motivation was Moore and Shannon 
 
                     on 
 
                     &quot;Reliable Circuits Using Less Reliable Relays.&quot; 
 
                     Layers of defenses 
 
                     such as firewalls and access control systems are composed. 
 
                     They ask 
 
                     questions such as: What is the vulnerability for a path? How 
 
                     do they 
 
                     aggregate? Are there redundant or useless mechanisms? How 
 
                     do we 
 
                     analyze cost? 0 is secure; 1 is insecure (the probabilities 
 
                     measure 
 
                     intrusion). For parallel circuits, if there are 3 ways in, 
 
                     it's less 
 
                     secure than one way in. This matches our intuition. All probabilities 
 
                     are &gt;= 0. In sequence, cheap, high probability components 
 
                     more secure 
 
                     than one alone. The probability of insecurity flowing through 
 
                     two 
 
                     identical components in series that are again replicated in 
 
                     parallel 
 
                     is: 1 - (1-p^2)^2. When this function is plotted against the 
 
                     single 
 
                     component option, it has a nice little wiggle in it and becomes 
 
                     more 
 
                     insecure than the single component at p = .618. Ira then outlined 
 
                     the 
 
                     formalism for considering multiple paths. The probability 
 
                     of 
 
                     insecurity is union of all of the &quot;non-stupid&quot; paths. 
 
                     They have some 
 
                     reduction formulas for common topologies.</p>
 
                   <p> Session 5 on Emergent Systems was led by Cristina Serban. 
 
                     The first 
 
                     paper in that session was &quot;Principles of a Computer Immune 
 
                     System&quot; by 
 
                     Anil Somayaji, Steven Hofmeyr, and Stephanie Forrest. Anil 
 
                     presented. They looked at computers as complex systems, where 
 
                     software 
 
                     is updated, configurations change, and system administrators 
 
                     are 
 
                     overburdened. We build them, but we do not understand them. 
 
                     Ruth 
 
                     Nelson classified our attempts to make models that accurately 
 
                     reflect 
 
                     these systems as &quot;a desperate move.&quot; Anil outlined 
 
                     what they 
 
                     considered to be general properties of complex adaptive systems: 
 
                     distributability, diversity, adaptability, disposability, 
 
                     and 
 
                     autonomy. They then tried to turn these properties into 
 
                     principles. For example, no small set of cells is 
 
                     irreplaceable. Steven Greenwald pointed out that infectious 
 
                     disease 
 
                     was a major issue, but now auto-immune diseases are. However, 
 
                     immune 
 
                     systems are still essential. Tom Lincoln stated that medicine 
 
                     is 15% 
 
                     science and models of dubious completeness. The models give 
 
                     us great 
 
                     clinical courage. Anil pointed out how immune systems are 
 
                     not computer 
 
                     security systems. There is no confidentiality, no data integrity, 
 
                     little accountability, and (perhaps most importantly) no 
 
                     guarantees. There is a physical barrier. Dixie suggested we 
 
                     consider 
 
                     analogies with the skin and brain as well as the immune system. 
 
                     Anil 
 
                     talked about identity being determined by behavior, which 
 
                     is 
 
                     spoofable, but intrinsic. In a sense, you have to become the 
 
                     thing 
 
                     you're pretending to be. Ruth Nelson pointed out that viruses 
 
                     spoof 
 
                     cells without being them. Anil concluded that we still need 
 
                     traditional security mechanisms. They provide the first level 
 
                     of 
 
                     defense.</p>
 
                   <p> The next paper was &quot;Composition and Emergent Properties&quot; 
 
                     by Heather 
 
                     Hinton. Heather started her research by looking at why composition 
 
                     fails and how properties emerge on composition. Previous approaches 
 
                     focused on information flow. Properties are the formal instantiation 
 
                     of the informal policy goals at a given system. While changes 
 
                     in a 
 
                     system and its environment may affect a system's properties, 
 
                     the 
 
                     system's policies are usually unchanged by composition. Heather 
 
                     classified properties by whether their satisfied by individual 
 
                     systems 
 
                     and/or the two systems' composition. She defined emergent 
 
                     behaviors as 
 
                     new behaviors relevant to a composite system but not its 
 
                     components. Ruth Nelson asked about disappearing properties, 
 
                     which 
 
                     Mike Williams suggested were submergent behaviors. Heather 
 
                     indicated 
 
                     that emergent behaviors are unpredictable or surprising behaviors 
 
                     arising from a composition. This implies that they are subjective 
 
                     and 
 
                     might be learnable from experience (such as what happens when 
 
                     you mix 
 
                     colors). Bob Blakley suggested that as you compose more things, 
 
                     more 
 
                     of the system behavior is underspecified and surprising. Emergent 
 
                     behaviors may lead to the emergence of desired properties 
 
                     on 
 
                     composition. No matter how we represent the system, we have 
 
                     to deal 
 
                     with effects of composition. Tom Lincoln was reminded of the 
 
                     difficulty of composing valid laws.</p>
 
                   <p> The final session, Session 6 on Networks, was chaired by 
 
                     Mike 
 
                     Williams. The first paper was &quot;Protecting Routing Infrastructures 
 
                     from Denial of Service Using Cooperative Intrusion Detection&quot; 
 
                     by<br>
 
                     Steven Cheung and Karl N. Levitt. Steven presented. Their 
 
                     models<br>
 
                     attempt to deal with a compromised router that can remove 
 
                     (blackhole)<br>
 
                     or misroute packets. Good routers diagnose each other to detect 
 
                     and<br>
 
                     respond misbehaving routers. Their approach makes assumptions 
 
                     about<br>
 
                     the networks, develops their system model and failure models 
 
                     for<br>
 
                     routers, designs the diagnosis protocols, and proves detection 
 
                     and<br>
 
                     response properties of the protocols. They design their responses 
 
                     so<br>
 
                     that they cannot be used against them by an attacker. They 
 
                     assume<br>
 
                     that the well-behaved routers are connected (no partitioning 
 
                     by bad<br>
 
                     routers), that neighboring routers can send packets directly 
 
                     to each<br>
 
                     other, and that routers know the network topology and the 
 
                     cost of<br>
 
                     every link. They do shortest path based routing. Misrouting 
 
                     routers<br>
 
                     are routers that forward a transit packet to a router that 
 
                     is not on<br>
 
                     the shortest path to its destination. They developed a classification<br>
 
                     of the strength of a bad router. A bad router can misbehave<br>
 
                     permanently, probabilistically (on every packet with a certain<br>
 
                     probability), almost permanently, or intermittently. They 
 
                     can<br>
 
                     misbehave on all packets, packets determined by addresses, 
 
                     or packets 
 
                     determined by address and/or payload. For a permanent bad 
 
                     router that 
 
                     acts on all or address specific packets, can they can use 
 
                     distributed 
 
                     probing: if C is closest to B, it can send a packet to B and 
 
                     see if it 
 
                     gets it back. For diagnosing intermittently bad routers that 
 
                     may be 
 
                     address or payload aware, they can use flow analysis: the 
 
                     amount of 
 
                     transit packets going into B should be the same as the amount 
 
                     going 
 
                     out. A good router never incorrectly claims another router 
 
                     as a 
 
                     misbehaving router (soundness). If a network has misbehaving 
 
                     routers, 
 
                     one or more of them can be located (completeness). Misbehaving 
 
                     routers 
 
                     will eventually be removed; good routers will remain connected 
 
                     (responsiveness).</p>
 
                   <p> The concluding paper of the workshop was &quot;A Security 
 
                     Model for Dynamic 
 
                     Adaptable Traffic Masking&quot; by Brenda Timmerman. Her thesis 
 
                     is on 
 
                     traffic masking for traffic flow confidentiality, and this 
 
                     paper is 
 
                     one chapter of it. She calls her approach Secure Dynamic Adaptive 
 
                     Traffic Masking (S-DATM). The model can also be self-modifying. 
 
                     She 
 
                     began by outlining a variety of incidents from Desert Storm 
 
                     which 
 
                     would have allowed for traffic analysis. She said that about 
 
                     2% of 
 
                     users needed traffic flow confidentiality (TFC). TFC masks 
 
                     the 
 
                     frequency, length, and source and destination traffic patterns. 
 
                     The 
 
                     fundamental mechanisms for TFC are encryption, traffic adding 
 
                     and 
 
                     delaying, and routing controls. Her model supports adaptable 
 
                     traffic 
 
                     masking for trade-offs between user protection needs and efficiency 
 
                     and performance. Early work on TFC encrypted the link and 
 
                     kept it full 
 
                     of noise. More recent work on adaptable transport layer traffic 
 
                     masking work well for normal low traffic, but large spurts 
 
                     makes it 
 
                     adapt, which gives away information. Mike Williams suggested 
 
                     considering multiplexing across multiple channels. Cathy Meadows 
 
                     pointed out that you need the people doing the innocuous stuff 
 
                     to mask 
 
                     the people doing the important work that needs to be hidden. 
 
                     S-DTAM 
 
                     mask statistical anomalies with bursts of traffic. It precisely 
 
                     specifies the acceptable ranges of system behavior and can 
 
                     model 
 
                     dynamic adjustments. Previous work required global knowledge, 
 
                     which 
 
                     didn't scale to the size of the Internet. A profile of masked 
 
                     traffic 
 
                     behavior is defined at installation time, including burst 
 
                     size, 
 
                     inter-arrival delay, and throughput. Statistics provides precision 
 
                     and 
 
                     reduces processing and storage. The model can change the statistical 
 
                     critical values. For example, in times of extreme crisis, 
 
                     people know 
 
                     you're going to react, so TFC can go down. Heather Hinton 
 
                     suggested 
 
                     considering an algorithm that ramps up and ramps down; prediction 
 
                     is 
 
                     hard.

                     Workshop on Education in Computer Security, Asilomar Conference<br>
 
                     Center, Pacific Grove, CA, January 19-21, 1988. (submissions 
 
                     due:<br>
 
                     December 15, 1997). [posted here 11/9/97] The Workshop on 
 
                     Education in 
 
                     Computer Security is intended to bring together those interested 
 
                     in 
 
                     developing and enhancing instruction in computer security 
 
                     within 
 
                     undergraduate and graduate computer science programs. The 
 
                     Workshop's 
 
                     objectives are to provide a forum for discussion of ideas 
 
                     and 
 
                     techniques in computer security education. The theme for the 
 
                     1998 
 
                     workshop will be the use of laboratory activities to enhance 
 
                     educational objectives. It is expected that the outcome of 
 
                     the 
 
                     workshop will be a set of laboratory exercises that can be 
 
                     used by the 
 
                     participants and others to enhance the teaching of security 
 
                     objectives. The meeting will also feature a half-day tutorial 
 
                     on 
 
                     Penetration Testing by Daniel Faigin, of the Aerospace Corporation. 
 
                     Penetration Testing is a holistic flaw assessment approach 
 
                     that is 
 
                     applied to expose weaknesses in an implemented system. This 
 
                     form of 
 
                     system stress testing is likely to be appealing to students 
 
                     and 
 
                     provides a rigorous framework from which instructors may fashion 
 
                     laboratory and course material. All participants must: (a) 
 
                     Submit a 
 
                     laboratory exercise, (b) Make conference center reservations, 
 
                     and (c) 
 
                     Complete the workshop registration form. Educators from undergraduate 
 
                     and graduate programs wishing to participate in the workshop 
 
                     are 
 
                     requested to submit a laboratory exercise or project description 
 
                     used 
 
                     to provide instruction on a topic in Computer or Network Security. 
 
                     Exercises should be submitted on or before 15 December 1997. 
 
                     All 
 
                     exercises will be organized in a collection which will be 
 
                     prepared for 
 
                     distribution to participants at the meeting. Submissions should

                     new 
 
                     results in the theories of computer security and in papers 
 
                     and panels 
 
                     that explore open questions and raise fundamental concerns 
 
                     about 
 
                     existing theories. The paper submission deadline is February 
 
                     6, 1998.

                     February 28, 1998) [posted here: 11/9/97] Computer security 
 
                     is 
 
                     concerned with the protection of information in environments 
 
                     where 
 
                     there is a possibility of intrusion or malicious action. The 
 
                     aim of 
 
                     the European Symposia on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) 
 
                     is to 
 
                     further the progress of research in computer security by establishing 
 
                     a European forum for bringing together researchers in this 
 
                     area, by 
 
                     promoting the exchange of ideas with system developers and 
 
                     users and 
 
                     by encouraging links with researchers in related areas. A 
 
                     complete 
 
                     list of topics can be found on the conference web page at 
 
                     www.dice.ucl.ac.be/esorics98. Papers should be written in 
 
                     English and 
 
                     limited to 6000 words, full page figures being counted as 
 
                     300 words. 
 
                     Each paper must include a short abstract and a list of keywords. 
 
                     Since 
 
                     special sessions will be devoted to posters and demonstrations, 
 
                     it 
 
                     should be indicated in the paper submission if a demonstration 
 
                     can 
 
                     accompany the paper presentation. A call for posters and 
 
                     demonstrations will be published with the preliminary program.

                   <p> Data Security Letter Subscription Offer<br>
 
                     ________________________________________________________________________<br>
 
                     A special subscription rate of $25/year for the Data Security 
 
                     Letter<br>
 
                     is now available to IEEE TC members. The DSL is an external, 
 
                     nonpartisan<br>
 
                     newsletter published by Trusted Information Systems, Inc. 
 
                     Eleven issues<br>
 
                     (usually 16 pages each) per year are published. The DSL welcomes 
 
                     reader<br>
 
                     suggestions and contributions and accepts short research abstracts 
 
                     (about 130 words) for publication on an ongoing basis. On 
 
                     occasion, the 
 
                     DSL will be republishing Cipher articles (with authors' approval), 
 
                     but 
 
                     such articles will constitute a small portion of DSL content 
 
                     (thus there 
 
                     will be very little duplication of Cipher material).</p>

                   <p> Sorry! Strong response has reduced our stocks of old proceedings, 
 
                     and 
 
                     we have closed this year's conference books, so we will not 
 
                     be 
 
                     accepting any more orders until spring 1998. You may still 
 
                     order 
 
                     current (1997) and some back issues from IEEE CS Press at 
 
                     http://www.computer.org/cspress/catalog/proc9.htm.</p>
 
                   <p> This year's Computer Security Foundation Workshop took place 
 
                     the 10th 
 
                     through 12th of June in Kenmare, Ireland. Topics included 
 
                     authentication protocols (specifications, analysis, and attacks), 
 
                     formal security policies (non-interference style and access 
 
                     control), 
 
                     and intrusion detection.</p>
 
                   <p> Copies of the proceedings are available from the publications 
 
                     chair 
 
                     for $25 each. Copies of last year's proceedings are also available 
 
                     at 
 
                     $20, and several earlier years at $15. Checks payable to &quot;Joshua
