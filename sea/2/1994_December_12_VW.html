       <p>Concept For a Project on the Creation of Software, Professionalism,
         and Responsibility
       <p>
   This project is concerned with two chief issues that bear on assuring reliability
     and quality of software and appropriate protection of consumers from injury,
     monetary loss, or inconvenience. One has to do with the formation of a profession
     in a robust sense, with the education and occupational self?identification
     of practitioners. The other, not entirely separate, has to do with establishing
     appropriate standards of care, especially with the division of labor between
     technical standards and procedures and ethical standards. </p>
       <p>
   Many people are tempted to refer to practitioners as soft are engineers although
     many practitioners did not graduate from accredited engineering programs
     or even receive specific preparation at the college level. Of those prepared
     at the college level, many received their training from computer science
     departments. Almost all states in the U.S. bar software creators from presenting
     themselves as engineers unless they have degrees from bona fide engineering
     programs. Corresponding to this split in the educational preparation of those
     who create software are two professional associations whose membership includes
     the creators of software, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
     (IEEE) and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).</p>
       <p><br>
   The history of the various engineering disciplines shows a pattern of formation
     of professional associations and of formulation and adoption of technical
     codes and procedures (some of which become government mandated) and of adoption
     and revision of codes of ethics. This orientation toward professionalism
     appeared early and continues to the present, with a period of intensive activity
     in revising codes in the late 70's and the formation of an umbrella organization,
     the American Association of Engineering Societies in the mid 80's. The current
     upswing of interest in the IEEE and the ACM in jointly promoting professionalism
     of software creators and establishing appropriate technical and ethical standards
     attests to the timeliness of these issues. These organizations are apparently
     ready to respond to some notable lacks: the absence of shared understandings
     among practioners about their individual responsibilities and the absence
     of orientation toward defining and maintaining appropriate standards of care
     in creating and reviewing software.</p>
       <p>
   In the meantime, specialists within and outside the professional associations
     have been investigating and devising technical procedures for creating and
     reviewing software in order to insure reliability and prevent loss and injury
     to consumers. It is yet to be determined what should be the division of labor
     between technical methods and procedures and ethical standards for helping
     practioners to identify and meet an appropriate standard of care.</p>
       <p>
   Lawyers concerned with liability for injury and loss from software defects
     and failures have an obvious interest in how relevant parties in the world
     of software address issues of individual responsibility, company responsibility,
     appropriate standards of care, technical methods and procedures, and ethical
     standards in order to assure quality and reliability. At the same time, the
     experience of thoughtful members of the bar in dealing with problems arising
     from software defects and failures can inform the efforts of those within
     the software world and observers, such as ethics specialists, who are concerned
     with individual and company responsibility and appropriate standards of care.</p>
       <p>This project would: 1) draw from the history and experience of the IEEE
         and other major engineering societies in promulgating technical and ethical
         standards to assist the IEEE and the ACM in establishing an orientation
         toward individual responsibility and?professionalism among software specialists.
         It would be directed to software specialists, whether they have been
         trained in engineering,
   computer science, another college major, or in companies. 2) study the various
         technical procedures and standards which are being proposed and tested
         to determine whether some have been or can be adopted or recommended
         by professional societies as options for improving quality,<br>
   reliability, and safety. 3) study the codes of ethics of IEEE, ACM, and other
   engineering societies to see whether they are adequate or how they might be
   supplemented to meet the needs of software specialists. 4) study the legal
   environment in which producers of software operate to see what legal resources
   presently exist to support the aims of 1), 2), and 3) above and what new measures
   might be considered. The project will seek ways to overcome any tensions between
   the approaches of<br>
   engineering and computer science to training and between the role of technical
   methods and ethical standards in promoting appropriate standards of care.?December
