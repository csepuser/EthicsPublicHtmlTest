                     Second, you are probably already aware of the joint effort 
 
                     of IEEE CS and ACM to make Software Engineering a profession. 
 
                     One part is a Code of Ethics. It can be reviewed and commented 
 
                     upon on the below web page. If you can, would you pass this 
 
                     page on to your members.<br>

                   <p>Dear Mr. Mechler:</p>
 
                   <p>Thanks for the correspondence. </p>
 
                   <p>In reference to your first e-mail, you might want to send 
 
                     a message to &quot;accreditation@ieee.org&quot; and inquire 
 
                     if they do in fact need evaluators in the field of software 
 
                     engineering. If you don't get a quick response, you can contact 
 
                     Carolyn Solimine at 1-908-562-5484 or e-mail &quot;c.solimine@ieee.org&quot;.</p>
 
                   <p>When I have a chance, I will look at the Web sites you listed 
 
                     and pass along any comments.</p>

                   <p>Greg Gillespie Editor<br>
 
                     While reading your article on IEEE/ABET accreditation of SE 
 
                     in the July, 97 issue a number of questions developed. What 
 
                     is the relationship of this activity to the Joint Steering(IEEE 
 
                     and ACM) to make SE a Profession? Since so much work has been 
 
                     done in this project it seems reasonable to have a connection. 
 
                     Also in the same issue you ask for evaluators, is it possible 
 
                     to become an evaluator for this category? I would like to 
 
                     participate in this area.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     Thanks<br>

                     I went to www.computer,org/tab/seprof without a problem but 
 
                     when I added the code.htm I get the message &quot;The requested 
 
                     item could not be loaded by the proxy.&quot; I'll try it again 
 
                     latter today or on Monday. Just wanted to let you know that 
 
                     I did not forget about you.<br>
