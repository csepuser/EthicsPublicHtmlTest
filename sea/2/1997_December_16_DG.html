       <div align="justify">December 16, 1997 </div>
       <p align="justify">To the Joint IEEE-CS/ACM Steering Committee on the Professionalization
         of Software Engineering and Executive Committees of the ACM and the IEEE-CS:</p>
       <p align="justify">The Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
         Practices has completed its work in developing a Software Engineering
         Code of Ethics and Professional Practice and recommends its approval
         by both professional societies. We recommend this action for the following
         reasons: Support by both societies will be a public assertion by the
         profession of a unified commitment to ethical responsibility, The Code
         represents an international standard of practice, The Code has been reviewed
         and adopted by industry, The Code presents a broad consensus of the profession,
         and There is wide demonstrated positive support, including from Academia,
         for the Code.</p>
       <p align="justify"> This Code complements the more general codes of ethics
         of both societies which address the issues of the computing profession
         as a whole. The Code of Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
         Practice addresses the ethical issues and standards of conduct which
         specifically arise within the practice of software engineering. In this
         sense the code is not a replacement for any existing code.</p>
       <p align="justify">The approval of this Code by both societies will be
         a significant forward step for the software engineering profession. The
         cooperative support given by both societies to the development and approval
         of this Code underscores the importance of a commitment to ethical practices
         by the profession and will serve as a model for other developing professions. </p>
       <p align="justify">The development of this Code was unique in its international
         flavor. The task force and the executive committee had international
         representation, including from Europe, Africa, Australia, and North America.
         As the process of development and revision proceeded, this network of
         international participation and comment spread throughout the world.
         In an effort to be consistent with the codes of the major computing professional
         societies throughout the world, the task force solicited responses from
         members of the major computing societies. Comment and support was also
         received from the International Federation of Information Processing
         (IFIP). The task force also included two lawyers specializing in computer
         law, and one representative from the military.</p>
       <p align="justify"> The Code has been positively reviewed by several ethics
         officers and ethics directors of multinational organizations after sharing
         it with software engineers in their organizations. Such industries included:
         Lockheed Martin, Northrup Gruman, and Digital Equipment. We also heard
         from CEO's of smaller companies indicating strong support for the Code.
         In fact, the Code has already, in its preliminary form, been adapted
         by St.Paul Companies as their information systems code of ethics with
         only minor modifications, such as, replacing the expression &quot;software
         engineer&quot; with &quot;IS professional&quot;.</p>
       <p align="justify">The Code was developed using a process of continuous
         review and revision. The final draft of the Code, together with a questionaire,
         was published on several web sites, in some ACM SIG journals and in Computer
         and CACM. The results of the survey were that most items had greater
         than 95 percent support with many at 100 percent. The highest level of
         opposition to any clause was 12%. In the light of feedback, the Principles
         and associated Clauses have been reviewed and modified where necessary.
         We are confident that if the survey were to be taken again, all Clauses
         would receive an approval rating of over 95% The Code has also received
         a positive response from academe. We have received several requests to
         have the Code included in computer ethics and software engineering textbooks
         and have been asked to develop case studies for software engineering
         classes based on the Code.</p>
       <p align="justify">The Code has already proven to be a dynamic and useful
         document becoming a model within at least one industry. Both societies
         have already recognized that education about their codes of ethics is
         an important issue. Several members of the SEEPP task force are on the
         IEEE-CS and the ACM committees which are responsible for the maintenance
         of their codes and education of the membership about their codes of ethics.
         To support the maintenance of and education about the Code, we plan to
         maintain it initially on the Software Engineering Ethics Research Institute's
         and Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility's web sites. The SEEPP
         Task Force will continue to gather input from the community about the
         Code and develop and share examples of using the Code. Industry has already
         donated case studies related to the Clauses of the Code. It would be
         beneficial to the profession if both societies endorsed this effort and
         approved the Code.</p>
