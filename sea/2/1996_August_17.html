       <p>I guess I misunderstood your memo of July 10. I didn't realize you intended
         to do the final draft. I thought I would get the suggestions and incorporate
         them. I think this would be better for two reasons: 1) to keep a single
         style (a minor matter); and 2) to take into account suggestions Bernstein
         and Weil have made-and with which I agree (a more significant matter).
         I also had left some loose ends I wanted to clean up. I guess I should
         have put all this on e-mail--like everyone else--but I didn't. So, I'm
         now doing this fax to give you some idea of thinking here. 
       <p>Attached you'll find my latest draft, which takes into account
                     both the changes you included in yours and the changes suggested
                     here. What follows below is a commentary on the two drafts
                     so that you can see the differences. But, before getting
                     into the details, I should add that--except for the change
                     of &quot;its&quot; to &quot;the&quot; in the last line of
                     the introduction and addition of &quot;endeavor&quot; at
                     end of Rule 7--all changes are confined to the subsidiary
                     clauses and even these changes leave more than 900 of the
                     text untouched. In other words, we are definitely in the
                     polishing stages. (Numbers with M preceding refer to your
                     draft; numbers with D preceding, to mine.) </p>
                   <p>D1.01. New. Bernstein's suggestion. </p>
                   <p>D1.02. New. Bernstein's suggestion. </p>
                   <p>D1.03. Same as M1.02, except for addition of &quot;by education
                     and experience&quot;. Bernstein's suggestion. [Change of
                     order is attempt to catch order of relevance better.] </p>
                   <p>D1.04. Same as M1.03. </p>
                   <p>D1.05. Same as M1.04, except that &quot;including...&quot; has
                     been moved to D1.06. </p>
                   <p>D1.06. Same as M1.05, except that reference to control of
                     quality and risk. Bernstein thought that quality control
                     belonged here and that risk control was an equally important
                     consideration. </p>
                   <p>D1.07. Same as M1.06. </p>
                   <p>D1.08. Same as M.108, except that &quot;adequate&quot; has
                     replaced &quot;proper&quot; (not enough to be proper), and
                     documentation has been partially defined by &quot;including
                     a log&quot;. </p>
                   <p>D1.09. Same as M1.07, except for addition of &quot;and related
                     documents&quot;. Bernstein worries that supporting documents
                     don't get the attention they deserve. </p>
                   <p>D1.10. Same as M1.09, except for addition of &quot;and related
                     documents&quot;. </p>
                   <p>D1.11. Same as M1.10. </p>
                   <p>D1.12. Same as M1.11. </p>
                   <p>D1.13. Basically the same as M1.12, but a bit shorter. </p>
                   <p>D2.01. Basically the same as M2.02, except for &quot;and
                     related documents&quot;. Moved to improve order. </p>
                   <p>D2.02. Same as M2.01, except for &quot;and related documents&quot; and &quot;well-documented&quot; before &quot;belief&quot;.
                     (Bernstein did not think merely believing to be good enough.) </p>
                   <p>D2.03. Same as M2.03. </p>
                   <p>D2.04. Same as M2.06 (except for addition of &quot;and related
                     documents&quot;). --M2.04 deleted because seemed to be equivalent
                     to M2.07 (or, at least, to D2.05). --M2.05 moved to employer
                     section (D4.06). </p>
                   <p>D2.05. Same as M2.07, except for substitution of &quot;fair&quot; for &quot;objective&quot; (and
                     addition of &quot;and related documents&quot;). Not clear
                     what &quot;objective&quot; means if it means something different
                     from &quot;fair&quot;. </p>
                   <p>D2.06. Same as M2.08, except for addition of &quot;or customer&quot;. </p>
                   <p>D2.07. Same as M2.09. </p>
                   <p>D3.01. Same as M3.01 (except for &quot;and related documents&quot;). </p>
                   <p>D3.02. Same as M3.03. (M3.02 moved to end because it seems
                     like a catch-all.) </p>
                   <p>D3.03. Same as M3.04. </p>
                   <p>D3.04. Same as M3.05. </p>
                   <p>D3.05-3.06. Attempt to cover &quot;self-dealing&quot; worry
                     in ? you deleted. Happy to delete if no one is really worried
                     about these issues. </p>
                   <p>D3.07. Revised M3.02. A bit shorter. Emphasis shifted from
                     avoiding to disclosing. </p>
                   <p>D4.01-D4.05. Same as M4.01-M4.05. </p>
                   <p>D4.06. Basically the same as M2.05. </p>
                   <p>D4.07. Same as M4.06. </p>
                   <p>D4.08-D4.09. Same as M4.07-M4.08. --M4.09. Assuring accuracy
                     of data seems to belong under Rule 1. Assuring authorization
                     for use of data [?] seems belong under Rule 3. Not clear
                     what &quot;legitimate&quot; adds. What does this rule add?
                     Recommend drop or . move. </p>
                   <p>D5.01-D.5.04. Same as M5.01-5.04. </p>
                   <p>D5.05. M5.05 substitutes &quot;properly constituted&quot; for &quot;appropriate&quot;.
                     Two words instead of one. Seems to all for bodies that, though
                     properly constituted, are not appropriate. What is point
                     of change? To rule out bodies which, though improperly constituted,
                     are appropriate? Odd. </p>
                   <p>D5.06. Incorporates new idea in M5.06, but with fewer words. </p>
                   <p>D5.07. Same as M5.07. (Accepts change from &quot;appropriate&quot; to &quot;commensurate&quot;.) </p>
                   <p>D5.08-D5.09. Same as M5.08-5.09. </p>
                   <p>D5.10. Accepts suggestion in M5.10, but extends it a bit
                     further for the sake of clarity. </p>
                   <p>D5.11. Same as M5.11. </p>
                   <p>D5.12. Follows M5.12. </p>
                   <p>D5.13. Same as M5.13, except for addition of &quot;knowledge&quot;. </p>
                   <p>D5.14. Same as M5.14. </p>
                   <p>D6.01-D6.04. Same as M6.01-M6.04. </p>
                   <p>D6.05. Follows M6.07, moving it here because it fits in
                     better, and (hopefully) improving style a bit. </p>
                   <p>D6.06. Same as M6.05. </p>
                   <p>D6.07. Same as M6.06. </p>
                   <p>D6.08. Slightly shorter version of M6.09. </p>
                   <p>D6.09. Attempt to clarify meaning of M6.08. </p>
                   <p>D6.10-D6.14. Same as M6.10-M6.14. </p>
                   <p>D7.01. Basically the same as the new M7.04. Moved here to
                     leave &quot;this code&quot; as final word. </p>
                   <p>D7.02. Same as M7.02 (except for &quot;and related documents&quot;).
                     Move seems appropriate given new D7.01. </p>
                   <p>D7.03. New. Parallels D7.02. Consistent with new emphasis
                     on supporting documents. </p>
                   <p>D7.04. Same as M7.01 (except for &quot;and related documents&quot;). </p>
                   <p>D7.05. New. Bernstein's suggestion. </p>
                   <p>D7.06. Same as M7.03 (except for &quot;and related documents&quot;).</p>

                   <p>CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS </p>
                   <p>INTRODUCTION </p>
                   <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce,
                     industry, government, medicine, entertainment, and ordinary
                     life. Because the utility of computers depends in large part
                     on the instructions written for them, those who design, develop,
                     and test software have enormous opportunities both to do
                     good and to cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, that
                     this power will be used for good, software engineers commit
                     themselves to making the design, development, and testing
                     of software a distinct, beneficial, and respected profession.
                     In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall
                     adhere to the following standards of conduct. The seven main
                     paragraphs state general rules. Each subsidiary clause is
                     a specific application of its general rule, one experience
                     has shown needs express statement; but no set of subsidiary
                     clauses exhausts the general rule. </p>
                   <p>Rule 1: PRODUCT. Software engineers shall, insofar as possible,
                     assure that the software on which they work is useful to
                     public, employer, customer, and user, completed on time and
                     at reasonable cost, and free of significant error. In particular,
                     software engineers shall, as appropriate: </p>
                   <p>1.01. Assure that specifications for software on which they
                     work have been put in writing, satisfy the user's requirements,
                     and have the customer's approval. </p>
                   <p>1.02. Assure that they understand fully the specifications
                     for software on which they work. </p>
                   <p>1.03. Assure that they are qualified, by education and experience,
                     for any project on which they work. </p>
                   <p>1.04. Assure proper goals and objectives for any project
                     on which they work. </p>
                   <p>1.05. Assure proper development methodology on any project
