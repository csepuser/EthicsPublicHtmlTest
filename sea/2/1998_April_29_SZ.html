                   <p>Background</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     In 1993 the IEEE Computer Society and the ACM established 
 
                     a Joint Steering Committee lilt for the Establishment of Software 
 
                     Engineering as a Profession.</p>
 
                   <p></p>
 
                   <p>In November of 1993 the joint steering committee made four 
 
                     initial recommendations: (1) adopt standard definitions, (2) 
 
                     define the required body of knowledge and recommended practices 
 
                     (in electrical engineering, for example, electromagnetic theory 
 
                     is part of the body of knowledge while the National Electrical 
 
                     Safety Code is a recommended practice.), (3) define ethical 
 
                     standards and (4) define curriculum and related matters for 
 
                     software engineering. These recommendations were based on 
 
                     the way established technical professions have traditionally 
 
                     been defined. The steering committee decided to accomplish 
 
                     these tasks via three tasks forces. At different times, there 
 
                     have been from one up to three task forces in operation as 
 
                     a result of this effort. The code of ethics and body of knowledge 
 
                     task forces have been active for several years and this report 
 
                     contains recommendations based on their results. The curriculum 
 
                     task force was only recently activated because its work depends 
 
                     on the other two.</p>
 
                   <p>Accomplishments</p>
 
                   <p>The purpose of the task force on the Body of Knowledge and 
 
                     Recommended Practices is to define the body of knowledge and 
 
                     practices at different levels of knowledge/skill needed at 
 
                     different points in the career of a Software Engineer. The 
 
                     approach recommended is to conduct a series of surveys to 
 
                     capture the categories of components of knowledge. The format 
 
                     of the surveys will allow us to analyze the common core of 
 
                     the profession as well as those areas that are particular 
 
                     to an industry segment. To test the approach, the task force 
 
                     organized several working meetings of volunteer experts to 
 
                     create the task statements for their area of expertise and 
 
                     conducted a pilot survey during November and December of 1996. 
 
                     We are publishing the analysis and recommendations &lt;http://www.computer.org/tab/seprof/survey.htm 
 
                     on the pilot survey to solicit comments from practitioners 
 
                     and other interested parties.</p>
 
                   <p>The purpose of the task force on Software Engineering Ethics 
 
                     and Professional Practices is to document the ethical and 
 
                     professional responsibilities and obligations of software 
 
                     engineers. The task force developed a code for a sub?specialization 
 
                     within the constituencies of both of the professional societies. 
 
                     In an attempt to reflect the international character of both 
 
                     organizations and the profession itself, the composition of 
 
                     the task force is multinational in both citizenship and in 
 
                     membership in professional computing organizations. We have 
 
                     published the proposed draft Code of Ethics &lt;http://www.computer.org/tab/seprof/code.htm 
 
                     for Software Engineers to solicit comments from practitioners 
 
                     and other interested parties. Next the proposed Code of Ethics 
 
                     was published in both Computer and the Communications of the 
 
                     ACM with a turn around ballot. Most items had at least a 95% 
 
                     approval rating. The code was also reviewed by ethics officers 
 
                     of various multi-nationals.Lockheed Martin, DEC, Northrop 
 
                     Grumman, etc. It was also reviewed by other professional computer 
 
                     organizations, such as the British Computer Society, the Australian 
 
                     Computer Society, and IFIP. The review process spread beyond 
 
                     our initial plan ,companies like TI and Hitachi asked and 
 
                     received permission to put it on their company bulletin boards 
 
                     for review and comment by their employees.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     The purpose of the task force on Education is to develop education 
 
                     curriculum and accreditation criteria for software engineers. 
 
                     They are also to coordinate with related accreditation programs 
 
                     in pursue of their goals. This task force has defined a draft 
 
                     set of accreditation standards and begun working on curriculum.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     Other deliverables of this steering committee have included 
 
                     public awareness presentations at several appropriate panel 
 
                     discussions at workshops, symposia and conferences, and position 
 
                     statement white papers.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     In 1997 the Steering Committee was approached by the Engineering 
 
                     Licensing Committee of the Texas Board of Professional Engineers 
 
                     to assist it with the issue of software engineering licensing. 
 
                     Through the efforts of this committee and others, the board 
 
                     was informed of the scope of software engineering, the key 
 
                     issues associated with defining it as a profession, and the 
 
                     professional organizations that represent practicing software 
 
                     engineers. The Texas Licensing Committee will formally request 
 
                     that the ACM and the Computer Society jointly work with it 
 
                     to define a body of knowledge on which national engineering 
 
                     licensing examinations will be based.</p>
 
                   <p>Recommendations of this Steering Committee.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     (a) We strongly encourage the IEEE Computer Society and the 
 
                     ACM to participate in efforts that continue the work began 
 
                     by this steering committee. Future work needs to be aligned 
 
                     with the confirmed needs of organizations or customers in 
 
                     education, licensure, standards development, and professional 
 
                     development. Furthermore, given that Software Engineering 
 
                     is an evolving discipline whose methods, principles and body 
 
                     of knowledge evolve over time, we believe that the determination 
 
                     of an appropriate body of knowledge, and the curriculum to 
 
                     support such body of knowledge, will evolve over time. This 
 
                     suggests that a permanent entity be formed to assure that 
 
                     there is ongoing communication and there are periodic revisions 
 
                     as necessary.</p>
 
                   <p>We recommend that the chair and vice?chair of the Joint Steering 
 
                     Committee be authorized to develop, in consultation with the 
 
                     other members of the Committee and the affected bodies of 
 
                     the two societies, a management structure for a joint, replacement 
 
                     activity that aligns more closely with existing functions 
 
                     within the two societies and is more responsive to the needs 
 
                     of industry, government and academia.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     (b) The survey conducted to determine the body of knowledge 
 
                     validated the use of the methodology to find what a software 
 
                     engineer should know. This Steering Committee believes in 
 
                     this process to determine, and refine over time, the body 
 
                     of knowledge. However, we also recognize the value of determining 
 
                     what a software engineer does, and this was not covered in 
 
                     the initial survey. This task force believes that the ACM 
 
                     and the IEEE Computer Society have to be drivers of the professional 
 
                     aspects of Software Engineering.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     We believe that the production of professional?quality surveys 
 
                     requires qualified professional support. Our experience with 
 
                     a volunteer?only group has been that the end products cannot 
 
                     be achieved with the needed timeliness and quality. Technical 
 
                     expert volunteers can provide contents but the quality is 
 
                     not uniform and the effort lacks continuity. We now appreciate 
 
                     the level of effort required and we note that other societies 
 
                     that have attempted to define bodies of knowledge have ultimately 
 
                     utilized professional staff because of these factors.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     We recommend that a new group representing the appropriate 
 
                     elements of ACM and the Computer Society be formed to own 
 
                     the process and product of the survey and testing effort. 
 
                     We suggest that the responsibility be given, respectively, 
 
                     to appropriate ACM SIGs (such as SIGSOFT) and IEEE CS Technical 
 
                     Activities (such as TCSE and others).</p>
 
                   <p></p>
 
                   <p></p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     29 April 1998 Final Report from SW Engineering Profession 
 
                     Committee 2<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     (c) The current draft of the Code of Ethics is ready for review 
 
                     in a formal consensus process. The review process should include 
 
                     balanced selection of representatives from software practitioners, 
 
                     educators, producers and users. The process should follow 
 
                     the principles of due process such as those used in standards 
 
                     development. Upon completion of the formal review it will 
 
                     be suitable for consideration by the appropriate bodies.</p>
 
                   <p>We recommend that the appropriate committees of the ACM and 
 
                     the Computer Society be charged with conducting this formal 
 
                     review. We also recommend that the appropriate committees 
 
                     support future activity by the software engineering code of 
 
                     ethics task force to address ongoing issues that may arise 
 
                     in this area.</p>
 
                   <p>(d) The education task force has been active for about a 
 
                     year. They have prepared draft criteria for accreditation 
 
                     of software engineering programs. They have begun the curriculum 
 
                     guidelines. Their end product should tie in with the continuing 
 
                     education of Software Engineer professionals.</p>
