        Small Grants for Exploratory Research</p>
      <p>The Foundation funds small-scale exploratory work in all fields of science,
        engineering, and education supported by NSF, through brief proposals
        without the usual external review. Such work includes preliminary research
        on untested and novel ideas; ventures into emerging research areas; research
        requiring urgent access to specialized data, facilities, or equipment;
        or similar exploratory efforts likely to catalyze innovative advances.</p>
      <p>Programs may use up to 5 percent of theur budgets for SGER awards. SGER
        proposals are normally for one year and may not exceed $50,000, with
        the average amount depending on the particular program; they are not
        renewable. Only one copy of a brief proposal is required. NSF program
        officers are not required to seek advice from external reviewers before
        making their recommendations, thus, principle investigators are strongly
        encouraged to contact the appropriate program officer to see if the proposed
        research would be suitable for SGER support or if a fully reviewable
        proposal should be submitted. </p>
      <p>[p. 4]</p>
      <p>...support from whatever source (for example, Federal, state, or local
        government agencies, private foundations, industrial or other commercial
        organizations) must be listed. The list must include the proposed project
        and all other projects requiring a portion of time of the Principle Investigator
        and other senior personnel, even if they receive no salary support from
        the project(s). The number of person-months to be devoted to the project
        must be stated, regardless of source of support. Similar information
        must be provided for all proposals already submitted or submitted concurrently
        to other possible sponsors, including NSF.</p>
      <p>If the project now being submitted has been funded previously by a source
        other than NSF, the information requested in the paragraph above should
        be furnished for the last period of funding. </p>
      <p>If the proposal is being submitted to other possible sponsors, all of
        them must be listed. Concurrent submission of a proposal to other organizations
        will not prejudice its review by NSF. Note the Biological Science Directorate
        exception to this policy identified on page 1.</p>
      <p><br>
        9. Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources &#8211; Proposal Section
        H</p>
      <p>A model formation,<em> Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources</em> is shown
        in section IX, Proposal Forms Kit. Information on NSF Form 1363 is used
        to assess the adequacy of the institutional resources available to perform
        the effort proposed in the Project Description. Proposers should describe
        only those resources that are applicable to the effort proposed. The
        instructions provided on the form should be [illegable]owed.</p>
      <p>10. Special Information and Supplementary Documentation &#8211; Proposal
        Section I</p>
      <p>Except in the areas indicated below, special information and supplementary
        documentation should be included in the proposal as part of the 15-page
        project description (or as part of the budget justification) where it
        is relevant to determining the quality of the proposed work. Information
        in the following areas should be included in Section I of the proposal
        and not counted as part of the 15 page Proposal Description limitation.
        This Special Information of Supplementary Documentation Section is not
        considered an Appendix. Specific guidelines on the need for additional
        documentation may be obtained from the organization&#8217;s sponsored
        research administration office or the <em>Grant Policy Manual</em>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rationale for performance of all or part of the project off-campus
          or away from organizational headquarters.</li>
        <li>Documentation of collaborative arrangements of significance to the
          proposal through letters of commitment.</li>
        <li>Environmental impact statement for activities that have an actual
          or potential impact on the environment</li>
        <li>Work in foreign countries. Some governments require nonresidents
          to obtain official approval to carry out investigations within their
          borders
            and coastal waters under their jurisdiction. Investigators are responsible
            for obtaining the required authorizations and for advising NSF that
          they have been obtained or requested. Advance co ordinations should
          minimize
            disruption of the research. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Projects involving the following are subject to supplemental documentation</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Research in the Antarctic or Greenland </li>
        <li>Research in a location designated or eligible to be designated a
          registered historical place.</li>
        <li>Research involving field experiments with genetically engineered
          organisms.</li>
        <li>Research involving the use of human subjects, hazardous materials,
          vertebrate animals or endangered species. </li>
        <li>Projects that involve technology utilization/transfer activities
          require a management plan which should identify special reports or
          final products. </li>
        <li>Projects containing a special component, such as Research Opportunity
            Awards or Publication Awards for Scients and Engineers with Disabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, Section I should alert NSF officials to unusual circumstances
        that require special handling, including, for example, proprietary or
        other privileged information in the proposal, matters affecting individual
        privacy, required intergovernmental review under E.O 12372 for activities
        that directly affect state or local governments or possible national
        security implications.</p>
      <p>II Appendices &#8211; Proposal Section J</p>
      <p>All information necessary for the review of a proposal should be contained
        in section A through I of the proposal. Appendices may not be included
        unless a deviation has been authorized. Section II.A contains information
        on deviations.</p>
      <p>12. Special Guidelines</p>
      <p>a.	Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER)</p>
      <p>Proposals (one copy only) for small-scale exploratory, high-risk research
        in the fields of science, engineering, and education normally supported
        by NSF may be submitted to individual programs. Such research is characterized
        as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preliminary work on untested and novel ideas;</li>
        <li>Ventures into emerging research areas;</li>
        <li>Applications of new expertise and new approaches to &#8220;old &#8221;research
          topics. </li>
        <li>Multi-disciplinary work, particularly crossing NSF program boundaries. </li>
        <li>Research having a severe urgency with regard to reliability or access
            of data, facilities, or specialized equipment</li>
        <li>Efforts of similar character likely to catalyze rapid and innovative
            advances. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The project description should be brief (two to five pages) and include
        clear statements as to why the proposed research should be considered
        particularly exploratory and high risk, the nature and significance of
        its potential impact on the field, and why an SGER grant would be a suitable
        means of supporting this work. </p>
      <p>Brief biological information is required for the Principal and Co-Principal
        Investigators only, and should list no more than five significant publications
        or other research projects.</p>
      <p>This type of proposal will not be subject to external review and the
        award amount will be substantially less than a program&#8217;s average
        amount. In any event, the amount with not exceed $50,000. The project&#8217;s
        duration will normally be one but may be up to two years. Renewed funding
        may only be requested through a non-SGER proposal, which will be subject
        to full merit-review. Processing of SGER proposals will be assisted by
        checkign the box for &#8220;Small Grant For Exploratory Research&#8221; on
        the <em>Cover Sheet for Proposal to the National Science Foundation</em>, NSF
        Form 1207.</p>
      <p>Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact the NSF program(s)
        most germane to the proposal topic before submitting an proposal to tertermine
        whether the proposed work meets the guidelines described above and SGER
        funding is likely to be available, or whether the idea should be considered
        for initial submission as a fully-reviewed proposal (See Appendix A for
        Programs).</p>
