       <p>&quot;Informational note- Sent December 11 1995&quot;
       <p>Bob, </p>
       <p>I have had trouble contacting you. I hope this email gets through. I
         am sending it to your computer.org address and home address. Below are
         two message I will send out by the end of this week so people can start
         to get some work done. And make plans for attending a meeting of the
         task force. Let me know what you think. </p>
       <p>don</p>
       <p>==================================================</p>
       <p>Dear SEEPPers, </p>
       <p>I am concerned by our lack of progress. I am not aware of any working
         groups starting work. I know you have all been quite busy but we need
         to get started.</p>
       <p>In March several of us met in Washington and wrote a statement defining
         the scope of the task force and reworked the formal procedures of deliverables
         from the task force. Bob has these documents and will forward them to
         the group.</p>
       <p>As a means of getting started, for each of our groups let me suggest
         the following:</p>
       <p> 1. We need to develop a series of preliminary statements to get discussion
         going in our working groups. Each group should have a statement of scope
         defining their primary activity. I understand our direction as being
         one of identifying potential ethical issues within particular domains.
         Those domains have been tentatively identified by working group designations.
         These preliminary statements can be developed by having some one individual
         write a DRAFT from scratch. This could them be circulated for a group
         response. Another approach to getting this document could be to ask your
         group to identify potential ethical issues within your area and actions
         that could be taken to reduce the likelihood of these activities. You
         or someone in your group could put these together and try to abstract
         a statement for the multiple inputs.</p>
       <p>2. It would probably help to enlist the aid of one or two volunteers
         on your committee to help get and keep things going. One these two documents
         are circulated a single list could be abstracted. The next issue is to
         identify and define more specific codes of practice related to your working
         group. But I think this can wait until we have identified the relevant
         ethical issues within each group.</p>
       <p>3. You have got to be ready to follow through. I have started my group
         TWICE but each time I did not follow through (see below). This has drawn
         some heat directed at me.</p>
       <p>4. Please keep in touch with me and let me know what you are doing.
         It would help if we shared our efforts with each other.</p>
       <p>5. I have reserved a meeting space for Saturday, February 17th at the
         upcoming Computer Science Conference in Philadelphia. The meeting is
         intended to report progress of our groups and plan new directions. Please
         let me know if you can attend.</p>
       <p>6. If I can be of any help getting your group started, please let me
         know.</p>
       <p> ====================================================</p>
       <p>MESSAGE TO BE SENT TO MY TASK FORCE ON PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE.</p>
       <p>To the members of the professional competence working group of the Software
         Engineering Ethics and Professional Practice task force. You have all
         recently received a letter from Professor El-Kadi expressing concern
         about the lack of progresses of our group,</p>
       <p>I must apologize for this lack of progress of our working group, especially
         to those who have already done work for the group.</p>
       <p>I have been concerned about the activity of the SEEPP task force The
         last task force activity took place in March, when several of us met
         to finalize the task force guidelines and set the direction and scope
         of the task force. This material has not yet been distributed to the
         SEEPP working group leaders. As one of the co-chairs of the SEEPP task
         force, I have tried to motivate it from the bottom up by developing a
         plan of action for our working group and sharing that plan with other
         members of the SEEPP task force. Although you all started the work of
         our working group, there is very little happening from the task force
         and I did not feel right asking any more from you until I see some positive
         indications that you work will ultimately bear fruit.</p>
       <p>Please have patience, I am taking a more direct approach to the problem.</p>
       <p>I have set up a new mail list for our group. Messages sent to the list
         will be forwarded immediately to all member of the group. Everybody will
         be able to see all messages. That is the way this message was circulated.
         A reply to this message will be sent to everyone in the group. Three
         members of the group have already done some work in response to my July
         message. I will forward the material to you shortly.</p>
       <p>Again, my personal apologies to each of you. </p>
       <p>Sincerely,</p>
       <p>Don Gotterbarn</p>
