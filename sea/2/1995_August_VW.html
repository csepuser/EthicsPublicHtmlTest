       <p>Task Force to Survey Software Engineers in 1996<br>
         by Patricia Douglas, IBM<br>
 	     <em>Computer</em> Vol. 28, No. 8, 100-101.
       <p>Patricia Douglas, IBM<br>
   0ne of the factors associated with recognized formal professions, as Capers
     Jones outlined in &quot;Legal status of software engineering&quot; (Computer,
     May 1995, pp. 98?99), is a well?defined body of knowledge. Often this knowledge
     includes many subsets of more specialized knowledge. Also necessary is an
     appropriate academic curriculum to transfer knowledge to students.<br>
   In keeping with the above principles, the Joint Task Force on Software Engineering
   Ethics and Professional Practices, established by the IEEE Computer Society
   and the ACM, is working to have software engineering recognized as the 37th
   engineering profession.<br>
   The joint steering committee has chartered four task forces. The first task
   force was established to adopt standard definitions, and this has been completed.
   The second task force was established to define the required body of knowledge
   and recommended practices. (In electrical engineering, for example, electromagnetic
   theory is part of the body of knowledge, while the National Electrical Safety
   Code is a recommended practice.) The third task f was established to define
   ethical standards. The fourth task force was established to define educational
   curricula. (The steering committee has also begun to study certification or
   licensing in other engineering professions.)<br>
   The second task force, for establishing the body of knowledge and recommended
   practices, is chaired by the author, joined recently by cochair Anthony Cocchi.
   A senior designer/programmer with IBM Research, Cocchi brings a background
   in systems architecture, software design, and programming to this work.<br>
   Our task force is developing a series of surveys to incrementally define the
   body of knowledge and practices that apply to different skill levels needed
   at different points in the career of a software engineer. These surveys will
   identify knowledge components falling into two categories: generic knowledge
   (such as mathematics and science engineering) and specific knowledge (for example,
   software analysis and software architecture). In each area, we will address
   static as well as dynamic knowledge.<br>
   We began focus groups in early 1994 to define a list of possible areas for
   consideration. The results were organized for inclusion in an international
   survey. The survey methodology was chosen because it enabled the most farreaching
   industry coverage. In addition, the survey format will let us analyze areas
   of commonality in worldwide software engineering as well as unique aspects
   of a given industry segment.<br>
   The survey will consist of statements concerning the tasks performed by professionals
   at different levels of expertise (see sidebar called &quot;Sample survey questionnaire&quot;).
   Our goal is to complete this phase by the end of October We are currently identifying
   industry subchairs who will have the following responsibilities:</p>
       <p>&#8226; Serve as a project manager within an industry sector to see
         that task items are completed on schedule and returned to the chair.
         Sectors include transportation, consumer products, engineering/design,
         medical/ health, education, insurance, pharmaceutical, telecom munications,
         aerospace/defense, public utility, financial banking, state and local
         government, manufacturing, library, legal, publishing,general business,
         federal government, and other.<br>
 &#8226; Arrange for the task writing workshop with respect to location, mailing
 notices, and hosting.<br>
 &#8226; Identify and work with key individuals to assist in distributing the
 survey and collecting the completed survey.<br>
 &#8226; Serve as a communications point for work in progress.<br>
 &#8226; Identify a mechanism within an industry sector to publicize ongoing work
 and gain support.</p>
       <p>We expect to have the survey created by the end of October and conducted
         early in 1996. So far, we have identified only 58 topics for survey questions,
         which is about 10 percent of what we will eventually require. If you
         can participate as a subchair in this work, please contact Patricia Douglas
         at pjd@vnet.ibm.com; or Tony Cocchi at tony@watson.ibm.com.</p>
