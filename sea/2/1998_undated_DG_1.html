                   <p>Comments: Overall I find this to be an excellent and much 
 
                     needed standard. I offer a few minor editorial comments for 
 
                     the committee's consideration. p.1 item 2. I recommend saying 
 
                     &quot;client and employer&quot;. It is necessary to balance 
 
                     the needs of both perspectives. A p.2 Preamble. 2nd sentence. 
 
                     I recommend adding &quot;operations and certification&quot; 
 
                     to the list. Operations and certification are also critical 
 
                     phases of the lifecycle in which software engineers are involved. 
 
                     p. 4 PRODUCT Several items listed here (3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 
 
                     etc.), while important, are actually process issues. Recommend 
 
                     changing the title of this section to &quot;PRODUCT and PROCESS&quot;. 
 
                     p. 4 item 2.09 The intent of this statement is unclear; recommending 
 
                     rewording. </p>

                   <p>Comments: IEEE Final Ballot General comments: 1. Although 
 
                     a preferred title would simply be Software Engineering Code 
 
                     of Professional Practice, one could accept Code of Ethics 
 
                     for the short version and Code of Professional Practice for 
 
                     the full one. Both titles together are confusing. 2. Even 
 
                     if the drafters claim the code is not prescriptive -in the 
 
                     short version preamble, the levels of fine detail often make 
 
                     it appear so. The full version preamble will specify the code 
 
                     prescribes these as obligations of anyone ...! </p>
 
                   <p>Does the IEEE have specific plans to lobby to see the code 
 
                     introduced as a means of discussion in educational curricula? 
 
                     And where? Please avoid technology imperialism and stress 
 
                     aspirations more than prescriptions and details. 3. A clearer 
 
                     hierarchy of concerns is now more evident than in previous 
 
                     drafts e.g., the public; client or employer, etc. This i!s 
 
                     useful. There are, however, still clear conflicts of interest 
 
                     that ariseA the conflict between Public and Client or Employer 
 
                     is one of major concern. 4. Nowhere is what is ethics or an 
 
                     ethical approach made clear.</p>
 
                   <p> There is no reference to any underlying philosophies or 
 
                     theories of ethics. Hence, there is no really clear, delineated 
 
                     assistance for the individual/group in making ethical decisions 
 
                     about particular behaviors. Though fundamental principles 
 
                     are referred to in passing, the ordinary software engineer 
 
                     would have no idea of what these are as a result of reading 
 
                     the code. Perhaps the drafters take an implicitly utilitarian 
 
                     approach? How to help in enforcing then item 8.08? See also 
 
                     comments on the Preamble of the full version and its vicious 
 
                     circle of self-foundation.</p>
 
                   <p> 5. Both Preambles stress: Making software engineering a 
 
                     beneficial and respected profession94: isnt it a bit ethno-ce!ntric 
 
                     ... and contradictory to another assertion the public interest 
 
                     is central to this code? 6. There is no indication of any 
 
                     method of enforcement or potential penalties to be made if 
 
                     the content is transgressed. See in 6.11-6.13, items lost 
 
                     among others, and which could constitute the basis for enforcement 
 
                     and complaint procedures. Specific comments on the Short version: 
 
                     Item 5. Why the word ethical here and only here? </p>
 
                   <p>Suggestion: promote an approach to ... which is in accordance 
 
                     with this code. Specific comments on the Full version: Preamble: 
 
                     - Growing role in ...: Why to put commerce in first? - Obligations 
 
                     founded in the software engineers humanity? What does it mean? 
 
                     And later The Code provides en ethical foundation ... We are 
 
                     in a vicious circle of self-foundation? - In general, the 
 
                     code appears overly illustrative, eve!n down to rather fine 
 
                     details about very particular behaviors: no doubt, however, 
 
                     its drafters have distinct examples of particular personal 
 
                     or organizational behaviors in mind that they wish to see 
 
                     countered.</p>
 
                   <p> But is it really needed to go so far? Will a too long code 
 
                     not be quickly forgotten? Wouldnt be better to alleviate the 
 
                     full version and have a kind of accompanying comment more 
 
                     explicit on what you have in mind? - Many items, although 
 
                     probably interesting for the quality of the profession, are 
 
                     out of scope from an ethical point of view, like for instance 
 
                     2.04, 3.05 to 3.11, 5.02 and ff., but also others. </p>
 
                   <p>It weakens the code. Principles and details: A- 1.01 to 1.08: 
 
                     the sequence order is all but clear. 1.07 for instance, although 
 
                     quite welcomed, looks like a lost item in the list! - 2.02 
 
                     is badly formulated. How could you sign a code of ethics and, 
 
                     at the same time, retain something illegally or une!thically? 
 
                     I was thinking reading more the Software Publishers Associations 
 
                     Statement on Anti-piracy than a Code of professional responsibility! 
 
                     - 2.09: incomprehensible. - 3.03 is a hidden item in the list. 
 
                     In my view, it is not a detail, but the principle. - 3.04: 
 
                     Could specifically include on-the-job training which is particularly 
 
                     evident in the work of e.g., Japanese and British software 
 
                     engineers. - 4.04 is so obvious that the reason why it is 
 
                     here is not clear. </p>
 
                   <p>Moreover, what is its specific relation to software engineering? 
 
                     It may also depend on cultures and countries! 0A- Principle 
 
                     5: see comment about ethical in the Comment on the short version. 
 
                     - 5.11 and 5.12 are most probably the cause of conflicts of 
 
                     interests. It would be better to put them at the beginning 
 
                     of the list, or even to put them in the principle, as suggested 
 
                     in my comment supra. - Certain clauses in this managerial 
 
                     section !are highly contingent on specific organizational 
 
                     practices, responsibility for which may be outside the control 
 
                     of software engineers or their managers, e.g., human resource 
 
                     or personnel departments, salary sections, ... - 6.02: what 
 
                     is the meaning of such an assertion? - 6.06 is not clear.</p>
 
                   <p> A- 6.11 is spelled out in such terms that is something which 
 
                     is more professional than ethical! - 8.08 is a duplication 
 
                     of 6.11 </p>

                     which appear to apply to any engineered product and not just 
 
                     a software product.</p>
 
                   <p> This bothered me because we should acknowledge the corresponding 
 
                     engin!eering principles instead of presenting them as pertaining 
 
                     to software only. 0A 2) I find the concept of software as 
 
                     a component in part of a larger system context missing. The 
 
                     fact that software is pervasive, interfaces to humans, can 
 
                     be embedded, can run stand-alone on another system platform 
 
                     needs to be highlighted. </p>
 
                   <p>I believe this wider context of software mandates a requirement 
 
                     for a &quot;humble &quot; attitude or respect of the pervasiveness 
 
                     and implications of software. 3) A specific issue that should 
 
                     be highlighted is &quot;lowest-life cycle cost&quot; vs. &quot;lowest 
 
                     development cost&quot; as this is a major instigator of ethical 
 
                     tensions. I really liked principle 3 dealing with the product 
 
                     as I was able to clearly relate software issues to this item.

                   <p>Comments: At first I was overwhelmed by the amount of information, 
 
                     especially as my prior experience with Code of Ethics, e.g. 
 
                     IEEE, was limited to what are referred to here as &quot;aspirational 
 
                     elements&quot;. However, on reviewing the Code a couple of 
 
                     times, and browsing other Codes, I became comfortable with 
 
                     the aspirational elements being something I could remember 
 
                     and &quot;hang my hat on&quot;, and the clauses being analagous 
 
                     to &quot;stories&quot; to help connect with the intent and 
 
                     meaning of the aspirations.</p>
 
                   <p> My only lingering concern is that others who are not as 
 
                     patient as myself may not have the fortitude to wade through 
 
                     the entire code and may actually be discouraged by the length 
 
                     and verbosity of it. The phrase &quot;inebriated by the exuberance 
 
                     of our own verbosity&quot; comes to mind. However, on reflection 
 
                     I prefer having both short and full versions of the code, 
 
                     and my decision to vote &quot;affirmative&quot; is based on 
 
                     the coverage o!f the Code, the spirit of the Code, and the 
 
                     rather perverse observation that it will provide excellent 
 
                     material for a thorough analysis in student education and 
 
                     hence bring home the concept and application of a professional 
 
                     code of ethics. Thanks for your hard work.</p>

                   <p>Comments: I proposed the following change twice already - 
 
                     once at version 3 level and again at version 4.0 , both times 
 
                     in Jan.1998 - . Since the reason for the change seemed to 
 
                     me self-evident, I kept the reasoning down to a minimum and 
 
                     suspect, that this might have been a reason why it was ignored. 
 
                     Since I feel, that this is important, this time I will give 
 
                     you the full reasoning. If you decide to override my objections, 
 
                     I would still like to hear your reasons. ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
                     Second sentence of the third paragraph of the PREAMBLE to 
 
                     the Full Version says: The list of Principles and Clauses 
 
                     is not exhaustive, and should not 0Abe read as separating 
 
                     the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional 0Aconduct 
 
                     in all practical situations. </p>
 
                   <p>When we analyse this sentence, we can say about &quot;the 
 
                     list&quot; that it contains a. Principles b. Clauses ... and 
 
                     that it ... c. is not exhaustive d. should not be read as 
 
                     separating ... We therefore have two distinctive parts of 
 
                     the list, which can be said to have two properties each. Let 
 
                     us look at the four possible combinations: 1. The list of 
 
                     Clauses is not exhaustive OK, the list of Clauses can of course 
 
                     be continued infinitely. 2. The list of Clauses should not 
 
                     be read as ... OK, Necessary condition, otherwise inflexible. 
 
                     3. The list of Principles is not exhaustive The list of Principles 
 
                     IS the base of the Code. Of course, we might later find omissions, 
 
                     but that can be adjusted when we get there. If we say NOW 
 
                     that the list of Principles is not exhaustive, we better sit 
 
                     down and think again. </p>
 
                   <p>4. The list of Principles should not be! read as ... It is 
 
                     not the Principles, but it is their application - embodied 
 
                     e.g. in the Clauses - , which can separate the acceptable 
 
                     from the unacceptable. It is not necessary to state that something 
 
                     impossible does not apply. Considering the four combinations 
 
                     we can see, that while the properties of the Clauses are well 
 
                     defined by the sentence, we can NOT say the same about the 
 
                     properties of the Principles.0D I therefore propose the sentence 
 
                     to be changed to read: 0AThe list of Clauses is not exhaustive, 
 
                     and should not be read as separating the acceptable from the 
 
                     unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical situations.</p>

                     disapproval): * 2.06. Identify, document, and report to the

                   <p>Comments: This document is, in general, excellent and with 
 
                     a few modifications (listed below) you may convert my vote 
 
                     to affirmative. I applaud and congratulate the Task Force 
 
                     for their fine efforts. I believe you can resolve item #2 
 
                     by referencing at the beginning of the Code an independent 
 
                     document, which can be worked on in parallel with this one. 
 
                     #1: (Preamble, paragraph 1) Change to &quot;..design, development, 
 
                     maintenance, testing, and acceptance/approval of software 
 
                     systems have ..&quot; #2: (Preamble, paragraph 2) Who is a 
 
                     &quot;professional software engineer&quot;.</p>
 
                   <p>A &quot;professional engineer&quot; (note PE after my name) 
 
                     is a legally defined entity in each State of the US. It may 
 
                     not be used loosely! It is imperative that this Code of Ethics 
 
                     clearly and unambiguously specify the population of individuals 
 
                     to whom it pertains (e.g., only graduates of computer science 
 
                     !programs, anyone who writes/scripts code, or licensed professional 
 
                     engineers [note new Texas licensure procedures]). Not defining 
 
                     the requisite population drastically undermines the utility 
 
                     of this document. Using terms outside of their legally defined 
 
                     meaning is not in the &quot;Public Interest&quot;! This criticism/concern 
 
                     applies everywhere throughout the document where the terms 
 
                     22professional&quot;, &quot;software&quot;, and &quot;engineer&quot; 
 
                     are used in conjunction. #3. (Principle 3.05) Change &quot;methodology&quot; 
 
                     to &quot;set of methods&quot;. To quote Ivar Jacobson &quot;.. 
 
                     a method is a planned procedure by which a specified goal 
 
                     is approached step by step, not to be confused with methodology, 
 
                     which is the science of methods.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p> Methodology refers to the study of methods and is inappropriate 
 
                     for 3.05. #4: (Principle 4.05) Begin sentence with the word 
 
                     &quot;Fully&quot; and end sentence &quot;in a timely manner&quot;. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: Including or not includin!g the following

                     safe, reliable, useful and reusable quality software ...22. 
 
                     Reusability throughout the various engineering disciplines 
 
                     has decreased costs, increased reliability, and decreased 
 
                     project completion times. Imagine, for example, having to 
 
                     build your computer out of discrete logic or building your 
 
                     keyboard buttons individually! </p>

                   <p>Comments: I am in FULL AGREEMENT with the proposed V 4.0 
 
                     of the IEEE-CS/ACM Code of Ethics. However I have the following 
 
                     comments : Personally I believe the word &quot;Software&quot; 
 
                     can apply to more than just computers, e.g. &quot;software&quot; 
 
                     for the Music &amp; Recording Industry in the form of Songs, 
 
                     or even Films.</p>
 
                   <p> Hence I feel that since the Code is so carefully worded, 
 
                     there should be at least in some of the principles 1 to 8, 
 
                     more explicit use of the terms 'Computer Software' which can 
 
                     then be followed by the general appelation 'Software'. D Again 
 
                     with regard to Principle 6 : Profession 6.12 : Express concerns.....are 
 
                     detected UNLESS THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, OR DANGEROUS. 
 
                     Again, here I feel that such a clause should be ABSOLUTE. 
 
                     0AThe rider of impossible, etc should not, in my view, be 
 
                     tagged on, because the effect is mitigat!ed. We may provide 
 
                     this &quot;seeing things in perspective&quot; in a separate 
 
                     clause. Same view with clause 6.13. So much for my initial 
 
                     reaction. Thanks for the opportunity. Anthony Lobo ACM - 4062584

                   <p>Comments: section 1.03 -- suggested changes in wording 1.03 
 
                     Approve software ... and does not diminish the quality of 
 
                     life, impinge on constitutional or civil rights, or harm the 
 
                     environment. Explanatory comments: Individual privacy and 
 
                     the free expression of ideas is increasingly impacted by software 
 
                     and digital communication systems. The only reference to privacy 
 
                     in the draft document is in section 3.12 which applies to 
 
                     the software PRODUCT.</p>
 
                   <p> While that addresses the necessity of incorporating privacy 
 
                     preserving features into new software, it does not clearly 
 
                     relate to the ACTIONS of the software engineer, the USES to 
 
                     which the software is applied, and the broader PUBLIC INTEREST 
 
                     in preserving political democracy. The suggested wording changes 
 
                     are intended to emphasise the responsibility of a software 
 
                     engineer to the this significant aspect of the public interest.

                   <p>Comments: Add 1.06A Avoid criticism of software engineers 
 
                     or their work with the purpose of winning a contract for work 
 
                     currently or in preparation to be contracted to or assigned 
 
                     to the other software engineers. This does not limit the right 
 
                     to have and publicly express professionally critical opinions 
 
                     or reviews of work of other software engineers. Append to 
 
                     2.01 In particular, they shall accept work only within their 
 
                     area of competence. Beyond this limit, they shall seek collaboration 
 
                     of appropriate experts. Add 2.01A Work only by themselves 
 
                     or with their employees or subcontractors towards fulfilling 
 
                     their contract or assignment; they shall not pass the work 
 
                     onto other persons without the client's consent. </p>
 
                   <p>Add 2.01B Shall not accept a professional assignment if they 
 
                     are aware or have reasonable cause to suspect that other software 
 
                     engineer is acting for the client in respect of the same assignment, 
 
                     until either the first cont!ract has been determined by the 
 
                     client, or the other software engineer has consented to them 
 
                     acting. Add 3.11A Identify themselves on documents including 
 
                     software resulting from their work; they shall do so only 
 
                     on those documents, which they worked on either personally 
 
                     or as collaborators. A </p>

                   <p>Comments: Dear Colleagues, Version 4 appears to be a fine 
 
                     piece of work, the product of much sensitivity, cooperation 
 
                     and agonising over detail, set out in an inspired and clear 
 
                     fashion. In my humble opinion, it is very good the way it 
 
                     stands. HoweverC having had a close look at it, and comparing 
 
                     it with the ACS (Australian Computer Society)'s Code of Ethics, 
 
                     I can offer a few observations... COMMENT 1: (grammatical 
 
                     only) In the (Full) Preamble, paragraph 2, the sentence beginning 
 
                     &quot;The Principles identify...&quot; doesn't read well, 
 
                     in my view. Perhaps the addition of 2firstly&quot;, a comma 
 
                     and &quot;secondly&quot; might help: &quot;The Priciples identify 
 
                     firstly the ethically.. ..participate, and secondly the primary..&quot;. 
 
                     COMMENT 2: Version 4 compares favourably with the ACS Code 
 
                     of Ethics (http:F/www.acs.org.au/national/pospaper/acs131.htm), 
 
                     which is quite nicely put, but needs to be read TOGETHER WITH 
 
                     a rather clumsy set of documents comprising the &quot;ACS 
 
                     Code of Professional Conduct and Professional Practice&quot; 
 
                     (to be found in the same web directory, in files: codintro.htm, 
 
                     codeprof.htm, codeb.htm, codec.htm, coded.htm, codeg.htm, 
 
                     and codei.htm). </p>
 
                   <p>Comparing the two complete codes is no mean task, as they 
 
                     are set out so differently, but after a few hours sifting 
 
                     through them, although they are surprisingly similar, there 
 
                     emerge a couple of apparent &quot;gaps&quot; in Version 4, 
 
                     which could (optionally) be addressed either now or in the 
 
                     future:... {A}: Principle 5 MANAGEMENT is much lighter weight 
 
                     than in the ACS combined documents. Some keywords that I feel 
 
                     are missing from Version 4 are, for example: &quot;Business 
 
                     strateg!y&quot; (ACS Code of Prof.Conduct(CPC): pt.B1), &quot;Accountability22 
 
                     (ACS CPC: pt.B4), &quot;Competence&quot; (ACS Code of Ethics 
 
                     (CE29: pt.2), &quot;good match (to needs)&quot; &amp; &quot;good 
 
                     value&quot; (ACS CE: 2.1, 2.2), &quot;continuity of services&quot; 
 
                     (ACS CE: 1.1)2C and &quot;respect my employees&quot; (ACS 
 
                     CE: 4.3, (4.4)). A {B}: Principle 6 PROFESSION - A sentiment 
 
                     that I feel is missing is &quot;I will go beyond my brief, 
 
                     if necessary, in order to act professionally&quot; (ACS CE: 
 
                     2.7) {C}: Principle 8.05 could possibly include the phrase 
 
                     &quot;relevant standards and&quot; between '..knowledge of' 
 
                     and 'the law..'. (Ref: ACS CE: 2.3).</p>
 
                   <p> COMMENT 3: (A personal recommendation) Para 3.03 IS OF UTMOST 
 
                     IMPORTANCE, yet appears in a very condensed form. It is the 
 
                     only clause that: - refers to &quot;eth!ical issues&quot; 
 
                     per se; - cultural issues; and - environmental issues. I believe 
 
                     that the &quot;Flow-on effects&quot; of IT is of paramount 
 
                     significance to the community and environment, and awareness 
 
                     and concern about this aspect is growing rapidly and should 
 
                     be more explicit in the code than &quot;public interest&quot; 
 
                     in the preamble and Principle 1 (1.03),and the diminished 
 
                     giant in 3.03!! </p>
 
                   <p>This aspect is also becoming politically charged, therefore 
 
                     requiring specific professional awareness/expertise for giving 
 
                     suitable advice when called upon, and in any case 0D for sensitive, 
 
                     holistic, 21st century design. ...Maybe the answer to this 
 
                     lies in a new clause (or two)... EG, preceding Principle 1.03: 
 
                     1.02a Advise, specify and design acutely aware of the possible 
 
                     &quot;flow-on effects&quot; upon the public safety, community 
 
                     ethos and the Aenvironment of an IT developme!nt. Best wishes 
 
                     and congratulations, Chris Simpson. (16/7/98) </p>

                     upon correction of identified problems) Comments: This document 
 
                     is, in general, excellent and with a few modifications (listed 
 
                     below) you may convert my vote to affirmative. I applaud and 
 
                     congratulate theD Task Force for their fine efforts. I believe

                     the Code an independent document, which can be worked on in 
 
                     parallel with this one. #1: (Preamble, paragraph 1) Change 
 
                     to &quot;..design, development, maintenance,D testing, and 
 
                     acceptance/approval of software systems have ..&quot; #2: 
 
                     (Preamble, paragraph 2) Who is a &quot;professional software 
 
                     engineer&quot;.</p>
 
                   <p> A &quot;professional engineer&quot; (note PE after my name) 
 
                     is a legally defined entity in e!ach State of the US. It may 
 
                     not be used loosely! It is imperative that this0D Code of 
 
                     Ethics clearly and unambiguously specify the population of 
 
                     individuals to whom it pertains (e.g., only graduates of computer 
 
                     science programs, anyone who writes/scripts code, or licensed 
 
                     professional engineers [note new Texas licensure procedures]).</p>
 
                   <p> Not defining the requisite population drastically undermines 
 
                     the utility of this document. Using terms outside of their 
 
                     legally defined meaning is not in the &quot;Public Interest&quot;! 
 
                     This criticism/concern applies everywhere throughout the document 
 
                     where the terms &quot;professional&quot;, &quot;software&quot;, 
 
                     and &quot;engineer22 are used in conjunction. #3. (Principle 
 
                     3.05) Change &quot;methodology&quot; to &quot;set of methods&quot;. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>To quote Ivar Jacobson &quot;.. a method is a planned procedure 
 
                     by which a specified goal is approached step by step, not 
 
                     to be confused with m!ethodology, which is the science of 
 
                     methods.&quot; Methodology refers to the study of methods 
 
                     and is inappropriate for 3.05. #4: (Principle 4.05) Begin 
 
                     sentence with the word &quot;Fully&quot; and end sentence 
 
                     &quot;in a timely manner&quot;. Additional Comments: Including 
 
                     or not including the following will not impact my vote. #1: 
 
                     (Principle 8.02) Change to &quot;... safe, reliable, useful 
 
                     and reusable quality software ...&quot;. </p>
 
                   <p>Reusability throughout the various engineering disciplines 
 
                     has decreased costs, increased reliability, and decreased 
 
                     project completion times. Imagine, for example, having to 
 
                     build your computer out of discrete logic or building your

                   <p>Comments: Recommended Changes: Delete the first paragraph 
 
                     of the short version preamble which begins &quot;The short 
 
                     version of the code....&quot; This material is too tutorial 
 
                     in nature. Mandatory changes: 1.03 does not seem to recognize 
 
                     that there are legitimate applications of software technology 
 
                     that may have negative consequences on the quality of life 
 
                     of some individuals or result in some harm to the environment. 
 
                     A smart weapons system is an example. The subprinciple 0Ashould 
 
                     be reword to indicate something like &quot;substantially dimminish 
 
                     quality of life or substantially harm the environment.&quot;

                   <p>1.05 Change 22co-operate&quot; to &quot;cooperate.&quot; 
 
                     In at least all of the following subclauses a direct reference 
 
                     is made to some issues about software. I firmly believe that 
 
                     a software engineering professional must be concerned about 
 
                     issues that go beyond ju!st the software that he/she may be 
 
                     working on or with. I suggest that a more inclusive word be 
 
                     used such as product, project, or system. See subprinciples 
 
                     1.05, 1.06, 2.02, 2.07, 3.08, 3.10, 3.12, 4.03C 4.06, 6.07, 
 
                     6.08, 8.01, 8.02, 8.04, 8.05. </p>
 
                   <p>2.08 Why is the concern for &quot;work detrimental to&quot; 
 
                     restricted to the &quot;primary22 employer? It seems that 
 
                     one should be concerned about work detrimental to any employer 
 
                     or group. As worded it seems to be OK to work for a second 
 
                     employer and one is no longer bound to ensure that the work 
 
                     isn't detrimental in some way. I suggest the wording: &quot;Accept 
 
                     no outside work detrimental to the work they perform for their 
 
                     primary or additional employers.&quot; 3.04 should include 
 
                     a reference to &quot;training&quot; in addition to the reference 
 
                     to &quot;education.&quot; They are not the same. Reword as 
 
                     &quot;..combination of education a!nd training, planned education 
 
                     and training, and experience...&quot; 3.05 editorial change: 
 
                     &quot;Ensure an appropriate methodology is used for any project...&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>5.09 should also address the issue of giving proper credit 
 
                     for development of intellectural property not just the ownership 
 
                     of intellectual property. Suggest that this be reworded as 
 
                     &quot;Ensure that there is a fair agreement concerning credit 
 
                     for development of and ownership of any software, processes,...&quot;

                   <p>Comments: 1.05 I would change section 1.05 to &quot;Cooperate 
 
                     in efforts to address matters of public concern caused by 
 
                     software, its installation, maintenance or support.&quot; 
 
                     While there are grave matters that affect the public interest, 
 
                     there are other non-grave Aones that are of concern to public 
 
                     interest: e.g., gluttonous software that demands huge memory 
 
                     and high-speed motherboards and processors which are of little 
 
                     value to the general public, e.g., a feature-glutted program 
 
                     only useful to techies and not to the general public. For 
 
                     many standard applications, e.g., wordprocessing, less is 
 
                     better than more. Perhaps software could/should be written 
 
                     to disable (and not load in memory) undesireable features. 
 
                     Secondly, there is the issue of software support: unlimited 
 
                     or free installation, maintenance and troubleshooting phone 
 
                     calls, ta!lking to real people and not automated and time-wasting 
 
                     irritations of menus and pre-recorded messages.</p>
 
                   <p> Thirdly, there should also be mandatory notification of 
 
                     pathces, updates and fixes. Many vendors have taken on the 
 
                     posture of not being responsible for their software. One buys 
 
                     it, cannot get support without charge, and there is never 
 
                     any notification of patches, updates, etc. You have indirectly 
 
                     alluded to this issue in this section and section 3, but these 
 
                     issues should be explicitly stated. 3.15 should be changed 
 
                     to: Treat software maintenance, currency and improvement with 
 
                     the same professionalism as new development. By currency, 
 
                     I mean that the since society and the working 0D environment 
 
                     change, software should always to checked to see if it meets 
 
                     current circumstances and has not become obsolete in some 
 
                     way. 0D I see software improvement! as an ongoing obligation 
 
                     to the public interest (social responsibility29. </p>
 
                   <p>In general, I want to congratulate those who worked on this 
 
                     code. It is very thoughtful. I especially liked the preamble 
 
                     in its caution to any blind reliance on detailed regulations, 
 
                     the realization of ethical tensions and the need for ongoing 
 
                     ethical deliberation. </p>

                   <p>Comments: I think these types of principles are long overdue. 
 
                     I believe ethics should be required at the University level 
 
                     if not earlier. I have a BS and MS in computer science and 
 
                     was not required to take any courses on ethics. The environment 
 
                     is different when you are working and there are many more 
 
                     considerations when designing software which makes this training 
 
                     crucial for our current and future software engineers. </p>

                   <p>Comments: Software produced to satisfy given needs is essentially 
 
                     a body of process competence built in a form executable by 
 
                     a machine, and as such made reusable by other people. I do 
 
                     consider this concept a key for understanding software and 
 
                     the obligations of the software engineer's profession. After 
 
                     this premise, following are the comments for the small modifications 
 
                     that I suggest to introduce: 1. Bullet 3.08. Add the following 
 
                     sentence: &quot;Strive to support 28or ensure that a support 
 
                     be given to) the users of the project, for guarranteeing a 
 
                     complete, adequate and clear expression of their requirements&quot; 
 
                     Motivation: the above kind of support is an essential part 
 
                     of the profession, and an ethical obligation.</p>
 
                   <p> 2.Bullet 8.04 second line: insert, replace &quot;the environment&quot; 
 
                     with &quot;the environment and processes&quot;. Motivation!: 
 
                     make more clear that the understanding of the user's environment 
 
                     depends on user's processes analysis. 36 7/20/98 8:46 Colin

                     decisions would affect the least empowered, but everyone.</p>
 
                   <p> Perhaps the least empowered should be given special emphasis,

                     terms, I am very impressed with this document and I commend 
 
                     its authors. With that said, I must vote negatively because 
 
                     of some specific shortcomings. 1. Editorial, Preamble (Short 
 
                     Version): &quot;Aspirational&quot; is not a word. Change &quot;gives 
 
                     the aspirational elements&quot; to &quot;summarizes aspirations&quot;.</p>

                     3: Change &quot;of the highest professional standards available&quot; 
 
                     to &quot;the best possible engineering solution to the problem.&quot; 
 
                     Reason: not all jobs require the highest professional standards. 
 
                     For some it is more cost-effective to provide a simple solution. 
 
                     4. Editorial, Principle 4: Change &quot;judgement&quot; to 
 
                     &quot;judgment&quot;. </p>
 
                   <p>5. BINDING COMMENT, Principle 6: Delete &quot;consistent 
 
                     with the public interest&quot;. Reason: this is NOT a trade-off 
 
                     and there is no reason to s!uggest that it is. 6. BINDING 
 
                     COMMENT, 2.05: Change &quot;where such confidentiality is 
 
                     consistent with the public interest&quot; to &quot;within 
 
                     the limits of the law&quot;. Reason: I do not want individual 
 
                     engineers to decide when to divulge my confidential data. 
 
                     I would prefer to trust legal mechanisms to decide when information 
 
                     must be divulged. </p>
 
                   <p>7. Editorial, 2.06: Change &quot;legislation&quot; to &quot;law&quot;. 
 
                     &quot;Law&quot; is finished &quot;legislation&quot;. One should 
 
                     not consider legislation-in-process. 8. BINDING COMMENT, 2.06: 
 
                     Delete &quot;or otherwise to be problematic&quot;. Reason: 
 
                     I have no idea what this means. 9. COMMENT, 3.06: Change &quot;industry&quot; 
 
                     to &quot;professional&quot;. Reason: I think that professional 
 
                     practice standards have a higher degree of significance than 
 
                     industry interface standards. I believe that this distinction 
 
                     should be reflected in this principle.</p>

                     a software engineer is. In particular, it does not describe 
 
                     the differences2C if any, between a prorgammer and a software 
 
                     engineer. Although this is a good code, employers and employees 
 
                     can say this code doesn't apply to them because they are only 
 
                     programmers and not software engineers. If there is a difference,

                   <p>Comments: Sections 3.09 and 5.05 are identical. I believe 
 
                     this belongs in section 5 - which is specific to software 
 
                     managers, but not in section 3, which seems to apply to all 
 
                     software engineers. Given the present state of the art in 
 
                     estimation, and the nature of the databases needed to apply 
 
                     what is known, it is not reasonable to expect this of all 
 
                     practicing software engineers. Proposed solution: delete section

                     on both stylistic and semantic grounds. Stylistically, it 
 
                     violates parallel structure, as all the other phrases are 
 
                     in present tense, not past. This should be too -- and for 
 
                     semantic reasons as 0A well. </p>

                     software engineer's knowledge). (This is not meant to imply 
 
                     that in order to behave ethically that software engineers 
 
                     must re-run all tests after every change to software; the 
 
                     &quot;well-founded belief22 takes care of that concern.) Action:

                     public interest. The Code should not encourage violation of 
 
                     the law, but rather promote rational and reasonable laws affecting 
 
                     the pracitce of software engineering. 8. Page 5, Principle

                   <p>Comments: I have a great deal of difficulty in assessing 
 
                     this proposed code of ethics. If it is simply meant as a list 
 
                     of platitudes without further implication, then its useful 
 
                     - the lists contain a lot of good ideas if tempered with a 
 
                     dose of the real world within which people actually work. 
 
                     If its meant seriously, though, it is ambiguous and lacking 
 
                     verifiable substance. The biggest problem I have is the lack 
 
                     of definitions of the basic concepts underlying the code. 
 
                     The first of these is the public interest.</p>
 
                   <p> The phrasing here implies that (1) there is a single public 
 
                     interest, (2) it is possible for someone to determine this 
 
                     and (3) there will be general agreement on what it is. I do 
 
                     not believe any of these three is correct. The Public simply 
 
                     does not exist - there are many publics whose interests are 
 
                     frequently in conflict. Thats why humans have invented politics. 
 
                     Similarly, there is !great ambiguity and uncertainty about 
 
                     the interests (clause 1.02) of employers, clients and users 
 
                     - and these are frequently in conflict with other and the 
 
                     various public goods. </p>
 
                   <p>These and similar problems persist through most of the principles. 
 
                     Specifically, looking at only the first thee principles2C 
 
                     I find the following clauses devoid of meaning because of 
 
                     ambiguities in the underlying concepts: 1.02, 1.03, 1.04, 
 
                     1.05, 1.08, 2.02, 2.04, 2.05, 2.07, 2.08, 2.09, 3.01, 3.02, 
 
                     3.03, 3.12. I have similar concerns with most of the remaining 
 
                     principles, but this gives enough idea on what is wrong. Some 
 
                     of the clauses pose potential legal concerns. Revealing information, 
 
                     even if in the public interest, may be a breach of contract 
 
                     or violate national security. This involves clauses 1.05, 
 
                     2.05, 3.12.0D Given that most software engineers work as employees, 
 
                     they are frequently not aware of all aspects! of their jobs, 
 
                     and may not be able to become aware due to workplace constraints. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>For example, learning the users requirements (3.08) may not 
 
                     be possible for a junior software engineer on a team project. 
 
                     Company policies and procedures may be quite adequate and 
 
                     proper, but conflict with this code. This involves the following 
 
                     clauses: 1.07, 3.05, 3.06, 3.07, 3.08, 3.09, 3.10, 3.13, 3.14. 
 
                     Military software is designed to be unsafe and 93diminish 
 
                     the quality of life for the target (1.03) - does this mean 
 
                     that a software engineer working for a defense contractor 
 
                     is automatically unethical?</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: To summarize: this reads like a nice 
 
                     academic exercise that is devoid of contact with the reality 
 
                     of many working software engineers. The clauses do contain 
 
                     good things to think about, though no one is likely to be

                     be included in comment section below) </p>
 
                   <p>Comments: Principle 2: The software engineer is already enjoined 
 
                     to act consistent with the public interest in principle 1; 
 
                     it0D is counterproductive to repeat the phrase in principle 
 
                     2. I most strongly recommend that the statement of principle 
 
                     2 be more succinct by dropping the final &quot;consistent 
 
                     with the public interest.&quot; However I would not withhold 
 
                     an affirmative vote based on the wording of this principle. 
 
                     A 1.08: I disagree that an ethical &quot;software engineer 
 
                     shall&quot; &quot;Volunteer professional skills to good causes..&quot; 
 
                     Encouraged, yes, but not required. (The second phrase is already 
 
                     embodied in 6.02, so this entire clause may be dropped.) I 
 
                     must vote negative unless this is changed or removed. 3.06 
 
                     requires following industry standards only excepting technical 
 
                     justifications (improvement, I assume).</p>
 
                   <p> Either the clause should allow! economic as well as technical 
 
                     justifications, or it should be phrased as &quot;only when 
 
                     justified.&quot; In the extreme, the whole phrase &quot;departing 
 
                     from these only when technically justified&quot; may be dropped 
 
                     since it is conditioned on &quot;as appropriate.&quot; I will 
 
                     vote affirmative regardless of this clause. 6.06 I am very 
 
                     concerned that this gives the impression that Software Engineers 
 
                     are free to place their personal judgment of the public interest 
 
                     above obedience to the law. </p>
 
                   <p>The crisis of confidence in the US Clinton and Nixon administrations 
 
                     came when well meaning and powerful people thought they were 
 
                     above the law. As it is, the statement is conditioned by the 
 
                     opening &quot;as appropriate.&quot; I cannot overstress how 
 
                     strongly I feel about this, but will not withhold an affirmative 
 
                     vote based on this clause. 7.02: I believe a software engineer 
 
                     can refuse to &quot;assist colle!agues in professional development&quot; 
 
                     and still be ethical. The pressures of making a living and 
 
                     supporting a family are enough without requiring dontating 
 
                     time and energy to colleagues. </p>
 
                   <p>I agree that SE's should be encour- aged to help colleagues 
 
                     develop, but not required. I must vote negative unless this 
 
                     clause is changed or removed. 4. Additional Comments 1.03: 
 
                     drop &quot;harm the environment&quot; This should be understood0D 
 
                     in the term &quot;quality of life.&quot; SE's have enough 
 
                     to do without trying to be environmental experts, too. The 
 
                     phrase is acceptable in 1.04 because that clause doesn't refer 
 
                     to &quot;quality of life&quot; and only requires an SE to 
 
                     &quot;disclose&quot; danger not (implicitly) to prevent it 
 
                     by with- holding approval, as 1.03 requires. 3.04 is essentially 
 
                     a duplicate of 2.01. Remove 3.04 to have a shorter code. 3.07: 
 
                     Strive to *sufficiently* under!stand the spec... It is unreasonable 
 
                     to expect SE's to *fully* understand the large and complex 
 
                     specs which occur today. 3.09 is essentially a duplicate of 
 
                     5.09 and has more to do with the process (management29 than 
 
                     the product. </p>
 
                   <p>Drop this clause to shorten the code. 3.10 Verification, 
 
                     or at least validation, should be mentioned in addition to 
 
                     the other assurance methods. 5.04 Assign work only after taking 
 
                     into account ... Please soften it since scheduling may require 
 
                     assigning people to tasks which do not advance their education 
 
                     or experience. Drop the &quot;only&quot; qualifier. 5.05 Instead 
 
                     of a &quot;risk&quot; assessment, I think it would be more 
 
                     appropriate to provide an uncertainty assessment.0D 5.07: 
 
                     drop &quot;and just&quot; A software engineer may be ethical 
 
                     even when not working for justice in the world. The &quot;fair&quot; 
 
                     qualifier is sufficient. 6.08A It is too strong to require 
 
                     all software engineers to *take* responsibility for error 
 
                     management. That may fall to someone else. I suggest the phrasing 
 
                     Accept responsibility for ... 8.01 As with 3.10, please add 
 
                     verification and/or validation to the list of techniques. 
 
                     0A 8.03 My dictionary defines &quot;literate&quot; as relating 
 
                     to human beings, not documents. </p>
 
                   <p>I suggest &quot;well-written&quot; or &quot;clear&quot; instead.0D 
 
                     8.07 This clause is already covered by 5.11 and 7.01. Don't 
 
                     repeat it here -- keep the code short. 8.08 This is a near-duplicate 
 
                     of 6.11; remove it for the sake of brevity. </p>

                     This is the first of my two objections. It is not respectful 
 
                     enough of confidential information as currently written. Suggested 
 
                     wording: Keep private any confidential information gained 
 
                     in their professional work, unless such confidentiality is 
 
                     not consistent with the public interest. Section 2.06 Editorial 
 
                     comment: The antecedent of &quot;their&quot; is unclear at 
 
                     best. </p>
 
                   <p>Suggested wording: Identify, document, and report to the 
 
                     client or the employer promptly, if in the software engineer's 
 
                     opinion...0D Section 5.03 Comment: This is the second of my 
 
                     two objections. Sections 3.12 and 3.13 require software engineers 
 
                     to respect the privacy of those whose personal information 
 
                     they are working with. However, there is no corresponding 
 
                     requirement for management. </p>
 
                   <p>Section 5.11 does notD adequately handle this beca!use staff 
 
                     might not have enough information to realize that they are 
 
                     not respecting other privacy, so staff would not be in violation 
 
                     of 3.12 so management would not be in violation of 5.11. This 
 
                     is a picky point, but I feel that we need to be more assertive. 
 
                     A different way that this might be handled is to change 5.11 
 
                     so that it requres management to provide all necessary information 
 
                     to staff so that the spirit of the code is not violated2C 
 
                     but what I am looking for is an assertion that management 
 
                     must actively work to support the spirit of the code, not 
 
                     just do things to keep staff from violating the code. </p>
 
                   <p>Suggested wording: Ensure that software engineers know the 
 
                     employer's policies and procedures for protecting and disclosing 
 
                     passwords, files, and other information that is confidential 
 
                     to the employer or confidential to others and held in the 
 
                     trust of the employer. Section 6!..12 Comment: While I wouldn't 
 
                     vote against the code because of this, I feel that as worded 
 
                     it tells the professional that if you don't think that anyone 
 
                     would do anything, then don't bother telling anyone. This 
 
                     is just an analog of the halting problem. I would drop &quot;ineffective&quot; 
 
                     from the wording. Suggested wording: Express concerns to the 
 
                     people involved when significant violations of this Code are 
 
                     detected unless this is impossible or dangerous. Sections 
 
                     7.02 and/or 7.07 Comment: Minor point that I do not hold against 
 
                     the code, but I would like to see that Professionalism calls 
 
                     for professionals to actively help each other. Suggested wording 
 
                     for 7.02: Assist colleagues in professional development. This 
 
                     includes volunteering information that colleagues need to 
 
                     successfully complete their tasks. Suggested wording for 7.07: 
 
                     Not unfairly inte!rvene in the career of any colleague or 
 
                     withhold information needed by a colleague to do his or her

                   <p>Comments: 1. I'm in total agreement with the principles of 
 
                     the code and with the clauses but have a general concern with 
 
                     the specificity of the clauses. Consider, for example, clauses 
 
                     5.07 -- offer fair and just renumeration -- and 5.08 -- not 
 
                     unjustly prevent someone from taking a better position for 
 
                     which that person is suitably qualified. D I don't diagree 
 
                     with either clause but because they are so specific it causes 
 
                     concern regarding other details that are not specifically 
 
                     included. For example because there is no clause stating that 
 
                     management shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, etc., 
 
                     might one infer that this is ok? I know that is not the intent 
 
                     but I'm afraid that this could harm the acceptance of the

                     is separated from knowledge and consent. Why? Does a software 
 
                     engineer need to get client or employer's knowledge and consent 
 
                     for each new use of property? E.g. each time a laptop is taken

                     that knowledge and consent is assumed and needed only where 
 
                     a company's ethics policy requires it in addition to authorization.

                   <p>Voting options: C- Negative (reasons for disapproval must 
 
                     be included in comment section below) I was pleased to see 
 
                     that many of my recommendations have been incorporated in 
 
                     the final draft. There are two main issues about which I am 
 
                     still concerned. One is the lack of any refer- ence to enforcement. 
 
                     The other is the use, in the Preamble, of language which equates 
 
                     professionalism with moral absolutism. As I said in my original 
 
                     critique: Because a code of ethics is about expectations rather 
 
                     than abstract notions of good and bad, I would rewrite the 
 
                     Preamble to eliminate vague references to &quot;good.&quot; 
 
                     This is not, after all, a doctrinal creed for a relig- ious 
 
                     body, but a document reflecting the current state A of informed 
 
                     thought about optimal practices in the field of software engineering. 
 
                     We should make it clear to the public -- and no less to our 
 
                     own colleagues -- ! that compliance with the code is not a 
 
                     matter of moral- ity, but a matter of professionalism carrying 
 
                     explicit assurances to the public and explicit consequences 
 
                     for violators.</p>
 
                   <p> I think that both my remaining concerns could be addressed 
 
                     by rewriting the first paragraph of the Preamble, as follows: 
 
                     Computers have a central and growing role in commerce, industry, 
 
                     government, medicine, education, entertainment and society 
 
                     at large. Those who contribute, by direct participation or 
 
                     by teaching, to the analysis, specification, designC development, 
 
                     maintenance and testing of software have a significant impact 
 
                     on the lives of others. To ensure, as much as possible, that 
 
                     all members of society will view that impact as a positive 
 
                     one, software engineers accept an obligation to make software 
 
                     engi- neering a respected profession. </p>
 
                   <p>Accordingly, softwa!re engineers shall adhere to the following 
 
                     Code of Ethics and Professional0D Practice, and all organizations 
 
                     subscribing to the code shall enforce it by means of appropriate 
 
                     recognitions and sanctions. By mentioning enforcement in the 
 
                     Preamble, we make a firm statement that we, as a profession, 
 
                     intend to regulate our own members. Such self-regulation is 
 
                     an essential characteristic of the professions. Again quoting 
 
                     from my original communication: This is ... difficult and 
 
                     often thankless work, but it's necessary if organizations 
 
                     like ACM and IEEE/CS are to become true governing bodies of 
 
                     the profession. The alternative -- governmental certification 
 
                     and li- censing -- is far worse, and I'm convinced that the 
 
                     time is fast approaching when we will have to demon- strate 
 
                     the ability to govern ourselves or be subjected to the heavy

                   <p>A reference to enforcement in the Preamble isC therefore, 
 
                     a step in the right direction. Standing by itself, however, 
 
                     it leaves unanswered many thorny procedural questions. That 
 
                     is why AI originally suggested a detailed description of the 
 
                     relation- ship between practitioners and professional organizations: 
 
                     If a code of ethics is to have any meaning at all, it must 
 
                     offer remedies to people who believe it has been violated, 
 
                     and the only appropriate way to claim such remedies is to 
 
                     appeal to the authority which promul- gated the code. In this 
 
                     case, such an appeal would be made to ACM, IEEE/CS, or another 
 
                     professional society subscribing to the code.</p>
 
                   <p> The disciplinary tools at the disposal of such societies 
 
                     range from warnings and rep- rimands to suspension or expulsion. 
 
                     Organizations use these tools, a!nd subscribe to codes of 
 
                     ethics, because they seek to assure the public that their 
 
                     members will act in certain ways, and that those who do not 
 
                     will lose their standing as members. Such assurances are the 
 
                     alternative to governmental regulation.</p>

                     following shall always act. 1.02: Replace &quot;Moderate&quot; 
 
                     with &quot;Accomodate&quot; 2.06: the phrase &quot;to violate 
 
                     intellectual property legislation&quot; should be expanded 
 
                     to ibclude other relevant legislation. 2.07 insert &quot;,&quot; 
 
                     after the word &quot;documents&quot; 2.09 I recognize the 
 
                     intent of htis clause but I find it too vague. It should be 
 
                     reworded or discarded. 3.07 This seems to be gratutitous. 
 
                     What else could a software engineer do? It could be removed 
 
                     with little loss. 4.04 Remove. Doing illegal acts is law-breaking 
 
                     and does not need to included in a code of ethics. 6.06 Telling 
 
                     software engineers not to break laws seems inappropriate to 
 
                     say the least. </p>
 
                   <p>Then to say it may be ok sometimes is a very dangerous without 
 
                     cohiiderable details, not possible in a code of ethics. So 
 
                     my advice is to remove this clause. 6.!11 Replace &quot;Consider&quot; 
 
                     with &quot;Acknowledge&quot; 7.05 Add an &quot;s&quot; to 
 
                     opinion, concern, and colleague. 8.07 How does this relate 
 
                     to 6.12? Both are not necessary, since they overlap significantly. 
 
                     8.08 Replace &quot;consider&quot; with &quot;Acknowledge,&quot; 
 
                     but this overlaps significantly with 6.11. Overall, this is 
 
                     an excellent piece of work and my congratulations to the task 
 
                     force. </p>

                     become &quot;minimum requirements&quot; Comment: Most people 
 
                     reading a Code tend to use it as a minimum standard. I understand 
 
                     the use of &quot;illustrations&quot; if you could get people 
 
                     to spend a considerable period of time understanding the ramifications 
 
                     of the principles. This does not happen. The clauses that 
 
                     exist are not a bad set of minimum standards. A Preamble Para

                     Comment: All human activity has the potential to cause some 
 
                     level of harm to the environment. Human activity needs to 
 
                     be balanced appropriately with care for the environment. 1.08 
 
                     Comment: I think &quot;good causes&quot; eliminat!es some 
 
                     useful voluntary activities to society but I can't think of 
 
                     better words at the moment. (It is also a pity that it is 
 
                     necessary to articulate this in a code) 2.06 &quot;to prove 
 
                     too expensive&quot; consider &quot;exceeds budgets or schedules

                   <p>2.08 Comment: Work should not be undertaken which is detrimental 
 
                     to current clients in a contracting situation. This is not 
 
                     covered by this clause. 2.09 0D Consider: ... &quot;inform 
 
                     the employer or another appropriate authority of the ethical 
 
                     concern&quot; before promoting that interest. Comment: the 
 
                     person employing the software engineer is entitled to the 
 
                     courtesy unless it is a &quot;whistleblowing&quot; situation 
 
                     involving fraud or corruption. 3.14 &quot;to outdated or flawed 
 
                     occurrences&quot; consider &quot;currency and quality issues&quot; 
 
                     Comment: quality of data goes beyond flawed occurrences. </p>
 
                   <p>4.06 AComment: If the employers' or clients' potential conflicts 
 
                     of interest are undisclosed, how is the software engineer 
 
                     expected to refuse to participate. Where there is a potential 
 
                     conflict of interest, not just undisclosed, there should be 
 
                     a refusal to participate also. 5.12 &quot;Not punish&quot; 
 
                     consider &quot;Not do anything detrimental to&quot; Comment: 
 
                     There are numerous ways human beings can &quot;get their own 
 
                     back&quot; on someone who expresses concerns without actually 
 
                     punishing them. 6.06 Comment: Further guidance is needed as 
 
                     to what they should do in this situation. </p>
 
                   <p>Disobeying laws can bring substantial penalties and people 
 
                     need to recognise this. The Code does not protect them from 
 
                     the law. 7.07 Comment: I believe significant further guidance 
 
                     by the Code is required here. Defamation is a significant 
 
                     issue here. Also many injustices have been done by those hiding 
 
                     behind &quot;good faith&quot;.0D General Comment. There is 
 
                     no mention of a disciplinary board to take complaints to if 
 
                     the Code is breached. </p>

                   <p>Comments: GENERAL COMMENT This code does not sufficiently 
 
                     address the engineering of software in a team setting. D PRINCIPLE 
 
                     1 Consider deleting the term always. Reason: No other principle 
 
                     is stated in absolute terms. 1.01D Ambiguous. Does this mean 
 
                     that software engineers should accept responsibility for the 
 
                     subsequent use of their work, or does it mean only that they 
 
                     should identify themselves as authors of the work they produce? 
 
                     1.02 Consider replacing this statement with a 0Astatement 
 
                     similar to this: Be prepared to favor the public good against 
 
                     the competing interests of the software engineer, the employer, 
 
                     the client or the users. Reason: In this context, moderate 
 
                     is vague. 1.03 Consider replacing Approve with 0D Release. 
 
                     Reason!: Software receives approval at many intermediate stages 
 
                     during the development cycle. We should be particularly concerned 
 
                     about the stage where software is cleared for general release.

                     the phrase meet the highest. Reason: Clarity. 3.02 Consider 
 
                     replacing this statement with the following: Collaborate with 
 
                     others to ensure that project goals and objectives are achievable 
 
                     and proper. Reason: Goals should be set in collaboration with 
 
                     all stakeholders. A 3.08 After the phrase been well documented 
 
                     and before the following comma, insert the phrase before construction 
 
                     begins.D Reason: It is irresponsible to begin construction 
 
                     before specifications are well understood. New Item 3.16 &quot;Ensure 
 
                     that software prototypes are not mistak!en for actual software, 
 
                     and that the capabilities demonstrated in prototypes are at 
 
                     least technologically possible.&quot; 5.11 Consider deleting 
 
                     this item. Reason: Redundant. 6.07 After supposed to be insert 
 
                     the phrase speculative, vacuous followed by a comma and the 
 
                     remainder of the sentence. Reason: More explicit language 
 
                     is necessary to rule out vaporware claims. </p>

                   <p>Comments: 1. Although Clause 1.08 fits under the principle 
 
                     of PUBLIC, I thought it fit better under the principle of 
 
                     PROFESSION. 2. Under the principle of MANAGEMENT, I thought 
 
                     there shouldD be a clause similar to clause 3.04 but from 
 
                     a management perspective. Management must commit to provide 
 
                     the training necessary to ensure Software Engineers are qualified 
 
                     for their assignment. 3. I suggest moving clause 6.08 from 
 
                     the principle of PROFESSION to the principle of SELF.0D 4. 
 
                     Under principle PRODUCT, I would like to see a clause added 
 
                     relating to measurement and process improvement. For example, 
 
                     &quot;Maintain metrics relating to their software engineering 
 
                     processes and products and use those metrics to improve their 
 
                     software engineering processes and products.&quot; </p>

                   <p>Comments: Please let me know if the cutting and pasting of 
 
                     my comments has made them unreadable (e.g. lines too long). 
 
                     If so, I will resend the comments Overall comments: 1. It 
 
                     is obvious that a number of individuals have invested a great 
 
                     deal of time and energy in preparing the Code. The result 
 
                     is admirable, but not entirely acceptable as it stands. I 
 
                     do not want to vote agains the Code, nor so I want to abstain; 
 
                     nonetheless I am uncomfortable voting in the affirmative given 
 
                     some of my problems with the Code. 2. My impression is that 
 
                     different parts were developed by different individuals, and 
 
                     that their works were attached to each other rather than integrated.</p>
 
                   <p> 3. The subjects of the document are ethics AND professional 
 
                     practice. These two areas are given neither clear definitions 
 
                     nor distinctions; professional practice appears to be largely 
 
                     ignored. This is shown, for example,! in the second paragraph 
 
                     of the Preamble to the Full Version, the second sentence: 
 
                     &quot;The Principles identify the ethically responsible relationships 
 
                     &quot; I believe that, in general, the relationships are not 
 
                     ethical, but professional. Attitudes, practices and rationales 
 
                     are more likely to be based on ethics. 4. The Code embodies 
 
                     minimal acceptable standards for ethics and practices, but 
 
                     it is not complete. Adherence should be to ethics and practices, 
 
                     not to the Code. 5. </p>
 
                   <p>There is a general ambiguity in the use of the pronoun &quot;they&quot; 
 
                     in Principle 2. In numerous instances &quot;they&quot; could 
 
                     be the client or employer as well as the software engineer. 
 
                     6. I would like to see a clear definition of the risks to 
 
                     the &quot;public good&quot;. There is an implied ranking of 
 
                     the interests of various parties; these may be able to be 
 
                     defined outside the specific Principles. 7. There are a significant 
 
                     number of phrases that are! awkward, at best, and grammatically 
 
                     incorrect, at worst. Some of these appear in the Principles 
 
                     in the Short Version and, therefore, carry into the Full Version 
 
                     as well. For example, the statement in Principle 1 has 2 problems3A 
 
                     split verb and an adjective rather than an adverb modifying 
 
                     the verb. An alternative statement might be: &quot;Software 
 
                     Engineers shall act in a manner that is consistent with the 
 
                     public good.&quot; I hope these will be corrected before the 
 
                     Code is finalized. There are other phrases that might me emended 
 
                     for readability. There are a number of places where there 
 
                     may be more appropriate words, but I cannot detail them at 
 
                     this time. However, I would he happy to send a revised MS 
 
                     word document highlighting those recommendations, along with 
 
                     justifications for my choices.</p>
 
                   <p> Specific comments: 1. Short Version, Preamble: examples 
 
                     and details of how these aspirations change the way we act 
 
                     85 I should hope that the Code helps define, or prescribe, 
 
                     the way we act rather than CHANGE the way we act. If the Code 
 
                     changes a person's behavior, then I question the ethics and 
 
                     professionalism of such a person in the first place. 2. Principle 
 
                     1: See restatement above. 3. Principle 2: Restatement: Software 
 
                     engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests 
 
                     of their client or employer and that is consistent with the 
 
                     public interest. Should also acknowledge that a software engineer 
 
                     may have both a client and an employer at the same time and 
 
                     that the interests of those two parties may be in conflict 
 
                     with each other. 4. Principle 3: Restatement to clear bad 
 
                     referent: Software engineers shall modifications adhere to 
 
                     the highest professional standards. 5. Principle 5: Include 
 
                     professional in the approach. </p>
 
                   <p>6. Principle 6: What does the publ!ic interest have to do 
 
                     with integrity and a positive reputation? Strike the final 
 
                     phrase. 7. Principle 8: lifelong learning regarding the practice 
 
                     Is the intent to learn about the practice, as a programmer 
 
                     may learn about the practice of surgery, or is the intent 
 
                     to improve one7s own knowledge of the arts and sciences of 
 
                     the profession, their advancement, and their proper application 
 
                     in the practice of the profession? I assume the latter, but 
 
                     the statement is not as clear as I would like. Full Version 
 
                     Preamble 8. Full Version, Preamble, first paragraph, second 
 
                     and third sentences. &quot; opportunities to do good or cause 
 
                     harm, &quot;, etc. </p>
 
                   <p>This is extremely bothersome, but I don't have a good solution 
 
                     at this time. The key is to minimize the risk that harm could 
 
                     be done. Rather than an opportunity (generally seen a positive), 
 
                     there is a potential for error and for lapses in th!e application 
 
                     of appropriate software engineering principles and practices. 
 
                     A 9. Full Version, Preamble, fourth paragraph, last sentence. 
 
                     If intended as a further clarification (in the vein of id 
 
                     est), then should be more closely associated with the previous 
 
                     sentence with a ; and small letter. If it is intended as a 
 
                     definition, then it should be more clearly stated. 10. Full 
 
                     Version, Preamble, fifth paragraph, second and third sentences. 
 
                     I disagree with the use of ethical in these sentences. In 
 
                     the first I would choose &quot;standards&quot; in place of 
 
                     &quot;ethical stance&quot; since professional practices also 
 
                     apply. In the third sentence, &quot;ethical&quot; is unnecessary, 
 
                     for the same reason. Principle 1 11. Clause 1.02 What does 
 
                     it mean to &quot;moderate&quot; interests &quot;with the public 
 
                     good&quot;? This is unclear. 12. Clause 1.07 &quot;Consider&quot; 
 
                     in what way? To what end? Take into a!ccount? Address? Make 
 
                     certain properly handled in the design or implementation of 
 
                     software? </p>
 
                   <p>13. Clause 1.08 Donating professional services should not 
 
                     be a professional requirement, although it may be encouraged. 
 
                     14. Additional clause for Principle 1: Not participate in 
 
                     the creation or dissemination of software for unethical or 
 
                     illegal purposes. (Stronger than identify and report.) Principle 
 
                     2 15. Clause 2.04 Who is relying and who is approving (only 
 
                     those authorized, I assume)? Closely related to 3.11. 16. 
 
                     Clause 2.05 To what extent is public interest equal to public 
 
                     curiosity? What about when there is a conflict between confidentiality 
 
                     and public interest? What the clergy and practitioners of 
 
                     the medical profession and legal professions know in confidence 
 
                     may not be relevant to the interests of the &quot;immediate&quot; 
 
                     public good (not well defined). </p>
 
                   <p>17. C!lause 2.06 rephrase: project is likely to fail, prove 
 
                     too expensive, violate intellectual property RIGHTS, be illegal, 
 
                     or otherwise be problematic. Also, be very careful about reporting 
 
                     to client without the proper authorization from an employer. 
 
                     18. Clause 2.07 Strike &quot;2C of which they are aware,&quot; 
 
                     - if they aren't aware, there is no potential action. 19. 
 
                     Clause 2.08 Why limit to &quot;outside&quot; work? May be 
 
                     within the same company and conflicts still arise. May have 
 
                     &quot;multiple bosses&quot;. Principle 3 20. Clause 3.01 There 
 
                     are 2 concepts that should be separated. Ensuring the understanding 
 
                     of tradeoffs belongs between the current second and third 
 
                     items. 21. Clause 3.02 A Same as: Ensure proper and achievable 
 
                     goals for any proposed or designated work project? 22. Clause 
 
                     3.03 What happened to professional practices? And be prepar!ed 
 
                     to act on those concerns! 23. Clause 3.06 Employers may also 
 
                     have standards that may be equivalent to the industry standards, 
 
                     just different. Depart from standards for ethical reasons 
 
                     as well? 24. Clause 3.09 Seems to be little different from 
 
                     3.01. 25. </p>
 
                   <p>Clause 3.13 S.E. seldom has control over the accuracy of 
 
                     the data. Test data may be under the control of the S.E. but 
 
                     it is representative rather than real or accurate. Principle 
 
                     4 26. Clause 4.01 Human values has no meaning. Each individual, 
 
                     &quot;good or evil&quot;, has a set of values that are human. 
 
                     27. Clause 4.04 Do we need to say &quot;don't break the law&quot;? 
 
                     Principle 5 28. Clause 5.12 2Punish&quot; is a poor choice 
 
                     of word. Rather you want to reward appropriate openness and 
 
                     honesty. Principle 6 29. This principle does not address advancing 
 
                     the arts an!d sciences of the profession - moving it forward. 
 
                     Essentially seems to be a PR statement, that may or may not 
 
                     have substance. 30. Clause 6.01 A And professionally? 31. 
 
                     Clause 6.03 Extending personal knowledge is the way this reads 
 
                     as opposed to advancing the profession itself. A 32. Clause 
 
                     6.06 Break the law when doing so appears to be in the public 
 
                     interest? Based on what definition of public interest? 33. 
 
                     Clause 6.09 Subsequent ramifications? And where are they stated? 
 
                     This is a long document to be discussed point by point with 
 
                     clients, employers and supervisors (and supervisees).</p>
 
                   <p> Principle 7 34. Clause 7.01 rephrase Support and encourage 
 
                     ethical and professional behavior in colleagues. Principle 
 
                     8 Clause 8.07 has no relevance to professional development. 
 
                     Belongs in prior section, if at all. </p>

                   <p>Comments: The code is often very far from current everyday's 
 
                     practice. And since it contains much vague terminology open 
 
                     to any kind of (mis)interpretation, I think the code is not 
 
                     the kind of precise guidelines which would really pin the 
 
                     issue down in a practical case.D With respect to the long 
 
                     version of the ethics code, I still vote affirmative though 
 
                     since I think that even if the code won't serve a more 0`law-like'' 
 
                     purpose, the code can serve as an interesting basis for a 
 
                     discussion among software engineers which hopefully will lead 
 
                     to more sensibility w.r.t. the topic.</p>
 
                   <p> Regarding the short version, I think it is entirely useless 
 
                     or even potentially dangerous since it only consists of a 
 
                     collection of empty terminology. What is ``benifical'' (in 
 
                     second paragraph) and what is in the ``public interest'' which 
 
                     is mentioned in many crucial !places. I would claim that in 
 
                     all the potentially difficult cases, the difficulty arises 
 
                     exactly from the unclarity of what is in the ``public interest'' 
 
                     (e.g., nuclear energy, disarmament, encryption technology, 
 
                     ...). So I suggest dropping the short version since it blurs 
 
                     the actual problem. </p>

                     an important oneL that the working groups should attempt to

                   <p>Comments: Short Version, paragraph 5 - I need to understand 
 
                     the way that this standard is going to be &quot;levied&quot; 
 
                     on people. Especially in reference to this paragraph and levying 
 
                     this requirement on management who probably are not members 
 
                     of IEEE/ACM. Full Version APara 2.06 - Need to define (or 
 
                     remove from this sentence) the words &quot;too expensive.&quot; 
 
                     We should not be putting our professional staffs on the hook 
 
                     to &quot;too expensive&quot; requirement. In the eye of some 
 
                     people the space program is too expensive, but I would not 
 
                     want to get wrapped around the axles trying to justify it 
 
                     at the worker level. 3.01 Does &quot;the public&quot; really 
 
                     apply here? Is it the responsibility of the engineer to identify 
 
                     trade offs to the public at large? Too many political adgendas 
 
                     are possible if we leave this statement. 3.04 Need to add 
 
                     &quot;training&quot; along with education, experi!ence, etc. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Training is significantly different from the others. 4.04 
 
                     Change the last part of the sentence to read &quot;... or 
 
                     other illegal/improper financial practices.&quot; 5.04 Training 
 
                     again needs to be added. (See comments to 3.04.) 5.05 Need 
 
                     to add quality to this statement. Statement should read something 
 
                     like, &quot;... cost, scheduling, quality, personnel, ....&quot; 
 
                     6.06 Is this statement meant as policies and procedures, or 
 
                     as law. This may not be applicable if law. Does the engineer 
 
                     make decisions of law or public interest, only in a case of 
 
                     emergency. Otherwise the engineer should not be allowed to 
 
                     violate the law. Just because the engineer believes that the 
 
                     task is &quot;inconsistent with public interest&quot; cannot 
 
                     let allow the engineer to violate the law. 6.12 This sentence 
 
                     should end as &quot;... violations of this Code are detected.&quot; 
 
                     The !rest of the sentence must be deleted. This is not an 
 
                     option.</p>

                   <p>Comments: Significant Comments: D The use of the word &quot;ensure&quot; 
 
                     in Clauses 3.02, 3.04, 3.05, 3.08, 3.09, 3.10, 3.11, 5.01, 
 
                     5.02, 5.03, 5.05, 5.09 sets up a requirement that may be beyond 
 
                     the individual's capacity to fulfill, given that software 
 
                     engineering is predominately a team activity. Replacing the 
 
                     word &quot;ensure2 with &quot;ensure, within the authority 
 
                     and resources available to them, that&quot; would suffice, 
 
                     but it is somewhat verbose - I'd be heppy with any equivalent. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Note, by the way, that the responsibility to identify and 
 
                     communicate about the things one can't fix is covered already 
 
                     in 6.12 In Clause 6.102C the reputation for unethical behaviour 
 
                     is not a sufficient basis; suggest 22Avoid associations with 
 
                     business and organisations which act in conflict with this 
 
                     code.&quot; In clause 6.12, it is important to &quot;express 
 
                     concern to the people involved&quot; even if it! is thought 
 
                     to be ineffective. They have, after all, a right to be advised 
 
                     that they are, in our opinion, doing wrong. The wording would 
 
                     be more appropriate as &quot;...unless this is iompossible, 
 
                     counter-productive or dangerous&quot;D In Clause 8.02, the 
 
                     use of theterm &quot;reasonable&quot; will create difficulty 
 
                     - what is reasonable to one person is not necessarily so to 
 
                     another. </p>
 
                   <p>Suggest 2Improve their ability to quickly and efficiently 
 
                     produce safe, reliable and useful software&quot;. Note that, 
 
                     if we accept the definition of quality as &quot;fitness for 
 
                     purpose&quot;, the word &quot;quality&quot; is redundant in 
 
                     the original clause. </p>
 
                   <p>Additional comments: Editorial Comments: Firstly, thanks 
 
                     to all involved, directily or indirectly, in production of 
 
                     the Code. As a member of the profession, I appreciate the 
 
                     effort that you have applied. Clause 3.04 is not about product, 
 
                     but practice. It should be moved under Principle 6, or perehaps 
 
                     under Principle 2 ! Clause 4.01 effectively duplicates Clause 
 
                     1.02 - it would be better deleted.0D Clause 4.404 does not 
 
                     address judgement - it would be better placed in Principle 
 
                     6, or perhaps in Principle 2. In Clause 4.06 &quot;... in 
 
                     a governmental or professional body...&quot; seems too narrow; 
 
                     &quot;...in any public body ...2 would be preferrable. In 
 
                     Clause 6.01 &quot;... acting ethically.&quot; would be better 
 
                     as &quot;... acting in accordance with this code.&quot; Clause 
 
                     6.04 would be better placed under Principle 7 Clause 6.06 
 
                     would be better placed under Principle 1. Clauses 6.11 would 
 
                     be better deleted - it states something that is not specific 
 
                     to the PROFESSION principle, and which is already stated in 
 
                     the second paragraph of the Preamble. Clause 7.08 would be 
 
                     better placed under Principle 6.</p>
 
                   <p> Clause 8.07 would be better placed under Principle 6. Clause 
 
                     8.08 would be better deleted; it is more relevant to Principle 
 
                     6, but effectively duplicates Clau!se 6.11, and is addressed 
 
                     in the second paragraph of the Preamble anyway. A </p>

                   <p>Comments: 1. There is good language in 2.01 and 3.04 regarding 
 
                     competence. I would like to see this also incorporated into 
 
                     the text of the Preamble - paragraph 4 - &quot;to assess their 
 
                     competence to develop the solution prior to accepting the 
 
                     assignment.&quot; 2. Principle 1 - I'd like to see an additional 
 
                     1.09 that refers to &quot;Develop software only if it will 
 
                     not enable the harm of the public&quot; 3. Principle 2 editorial 
 
                     comment: Outstanding language in 2.01! 4. Principle 2: I would 
 
                     like to see added: Return all documentation to the employer 
 
                     at the conclusion of their role in a project. 5. Principle 
 
                     3: Editorial comment: This seems to be a good place to add 
 
                     something about the anticipation of environmental changes 
 
                     that will impact the software, such as a Year 2000 requirement.</p>
 
                   <p> 6. Principle 4: Add to 4.03: &quot;Decline involvement with 
 
                     any software review assignments w!here their opinion or background 
 
                     would prevent objectivity. Disclose any potential conflicts 
 
                     prior to the review.&quot; Editorial: This is extremely important 
 
                     in our profession where past experience so often provides 
 
                     bias towards future decisions. For example, an avid AS/400 
 
                     programmer would not be able to objectively evaluate database 
 
                     packages without a bias towards the DB/400. 0A7. Related to 
 
                     5.08: there are two additional angles that need to be covered. 
 
                     Employers need to offer future employees acceptance terms 
 
                     that do not force the employee to jeopardize their current 
 
                     employer. Likewise, professionals should not search for or 
 
                     accept new employment opportunities in a manner that undermines 
 
                     their current employer.</p>
 
                   <p> 8. 6.05: Add &quot;client and employer&quot; to the end 
 
                     of the sentence. 9. 7.08 does not seem to belong in Principle 
 
                     7. It would be better fitted in Principle 4 or 6. 10. Principle 
 
                     8: Add &quot;Improve abi!lity to communicate the technical 
 
                     aspects of our profession to non-technical parties of interest, 
 
                     users, business managers, etc.&quot; This is a great piece 
 
                     of work. Something that is badly needed within our professional.

                   <p>Comments: I feel that the Code makes excellent points and 
 
                     is well written. However, in my experience, these topics are 
 
                     relatively basic. The real ethical problems arise from tensions 
 
                     between conflicting definitions of what is good and/or just. 
 
                     Here are some examples of tensions that raise ethical dilemmas: 
 
                     - Long versus short term benefits - Benefits to customers 
 
                     versus benefits to stockholders - Benefits to executives versus 
 
                     benefits employees - Benefits to the company versus benefits 
 
                     to a community - Benefits to a local division versus benefits 
 
                     to the enterprise - What is appropriate for a specific event 
 
                     versus what might set a future precedent - When good ends 
 
                     are used to justify questionable means These problems arise 
 
                     regularly in all areas of life, including in software engineering. 
 
                     This Code, while necessary, is nowhere near sufficient to 
 
                     provide guidance in thes!e practical situations.</p>

                     in our opinion a project will fail. This is not fair to the

                   <p>Comments: Comments are as follows: Preamble, second paragraph, 
 
                     first sentence: &quot;Software engineers shall commit themselves 
 
                     to making analysis, specification, design, development, testing, 
 
                     and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession.&quot; 
 
                     Analysis, prior to specification, implies requirements analysis. 
 
                     Requirements are a major source of errors forthe lack of objective 
 
                     acceptance criteria for completeness. Furthermore, in many 
 
                     applications, deep domain knowledge is required to conduct 
 
                     analysis and generate requirements.</p>
 
                   <p> Given the broad scope of software applications, it is not 
 
                     logical to expect the software engineer to have deep domain 
 
                     knowledge to conduct all of the requirements analyses. A statement 
 
                     to address this point is needed in the preamble. Such a statement 
 
                     would then be consistent with several existing statements 
 
                     in the document that attempt to establissh a biundary: &quot;3!.04 
 
                     Ensure that they are qualified .... &quot;3.08 &quot;satisfies 
 
                     user's requirements....,&quot; implies software engineers 
 
                     not responsible for the requirements. &quot;3.07 Strives to 
 
                     fully understand specifications.....&quot; &quot;7.08 In situations 
 
                     outside area of competence, call upon the opinion of other 
 
                     professionals....,&quot; ; statements on requirements analysis 
 
                     would help here. </p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: The document in its current form is 
 
                     not definitve in the area of requirements analysis and the 
 
                     responsibility of the software engineer. My negative vote 
 
                     is resolved when a clear deifnitive boundary of responsibility 
 
                     on the subject of requirements analysis is established. </p>

                     or even keep separate what are general moral imperatives and 
 
                     what is really specific to Software Engineering.</p>

                   <p>Comments: Regarding Full version, PREAMBLE, para 4, second 
 
                     sentence: change 'speculate on' to 'consider', i.e. to CONSIDER 
 
                     how the public... This is a minor point only, but in my view 
 
                     'speculate' does not carry sufficient force for this responsibility. 
 
                     'Consider' implies a more informed reflection on the issue 
 
                     at hand. </p>

                   <p>Comments: Section/Principle 3: Product 3.05 Ensure an appropriate 
 
                     methodology exists for any project on which they work or propose 
 
                     to work and follow such methodology. Added: exists Added: 
 
                     and follow such methodology Including these words clarifies 
 
                     the need and required use of a methodology. Although not all 
 
                     projects require the same type of methodology, a methodology 
 
                     is required. As section 3.05 is currently stated, the reader 
 
                     may assume if a methodology exists, it is not required to 
 
                     be used.</p>

                   <p>Comments: The only thing I see missing from this is some 
 
                     kind of infrastructure for maintaining the code, and for hearings, 
 
                     appeals, and requests for interpretation. The former could 
 
                     be some kind of committee. The latter might be something like 
 
                     a judicial council. 0D This comment is non-binding because 
 
                     I really have no idea about how such an infrastructure should 
 
                     be implemented, nor is it a given that one is required. Something 
 
                     to consider, that's all. Without such an infrastructure, there 
 
                     is no way to enforce the code, nor is there any route of appeal 
 
                     when one is fired or otherwise harmed for following the code.D 
 
                     The code itself is well-done. </p>
 
                   <p>Even the objections I had to the draft code were addressed. 
 
                     Nice work. </p>

                   <p>Comments: Metastatement: It would have been helpful, if the 
 
                     document contained line numbers! * PREAMBLE, para 2, line 
 
                     1: -not highly important- I think 'retiring software' should 
 
                     also be ncluded * para 2, line 2: -important- shouldn't we 
 
                     speak of 'software systems' -software alone might be taken 
 
                     to narrow a view- * 1 PUBLIC -editorial- I think this word 
 
                     is misleading -could be an adjectiv! Proposal: 'Public interest'? 
 
                     * 5 MANAGEMENT -minor concern-: I do not think that this should 
 
                     be in the code. That is general management practice and should 
 
                     be in the code of ethics of management. * 7 COLLEGUES: -editorial- 
 
                     to me it is not clear what domain the word 'collegues' implies. 
 
                     We should clarify that it is the0D professional collegue! 
 
                     * 1-8: -minor concern- What I miss, is somewhere the word 
 
                     ! 'responsibility' and somewhere also that we have to consider 
 
                     'future implications' of software ----- PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE 
 
                     section ------------------------- * clause 2.06: -minor- we 
 
                     could also add 'is work already be done somewhere else and 
 
                     thus redundant' * clause 2.07 -editorial- &quot;...in software 
 
                     or related documents.. &quot; is2C to me, ambiguous: It could 
 
                     mean the means of reporting * clause 3.07 -major- add: understand 
 
                     the REQUIREMENTS AND the specifications * clause 5.02: -major-: 
 
                     replace 'files' by data or add 'data' * clause 5.06, 5.07, 
 
                     5.08: -minor- I do not think that these are in in any way 
 
                     specific to software engineering, they are rather general 
 
                     management practices.</p>
 
                   <p> They should be deleted here. But I do not mind if they stay. 
 
                     * clause 6.02: -editorial- not only 'software engineering' 
 
                     but also what software -itself!- can, and cannot, do * clause 
 
                     7.06 : -editorial- replace files by 'data' or add 'data' </p>

                     that should be used here is &quot;assure&quot; which is defined 
 
                     as &quot; to convince&quot; or &quot;to give confidence.&quot; 
 
                     Specifically, &quot;ensure&quot; should be replaced with &quot;assure&quot;

                   <p>Comments: Nearly all 'Principles' sections include the words 
 
                     &quot;as appropriate&quot;. While the intent is to not force 
 
                     engineers to do things that don't apply in a given situation, 
 
                     there are some portions of each Principle which should not 
 
                     be 'optional'. The words &quot;as appropriate&quot; imply 
 
                     such optionality. To change my vote to Afirmative, please 
 
                     separate the tenets of each section into non-optional and 
 
                     'as apropriate or optional'. Using only Principle 1 as an

                     Software ......shall: 1.01 --- 1.03 --- 1.04 --- 1.06 --- 
 
                     1.08 --- and shall, as appropriate3A 1.02 --- 1.05 --- 1.07 
 
                     ---&quot; In this way, we define absolute ethics and show 
 
                     additional ethical concerns which might not be involved in 
 
                     all cases. I will leave the choice of 'absolutes' to the task 
 
                     force, but expect to see! some 'always appropriate' elements 
 
                     specified in each Principle section.</p>

                   <p>Comments: I do not wish to withhold approval, but I consider 
 
                     that Principle 3 would be improved by changing wording to 
 
                     focus on the result rather than just the high standard of 
 
                     effort. I would change it to read (changes capitalized): Software 
 
                     engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications 
 
                     SERVE THEIR PURPOSES AS WELL AS POSSIBLE THROUGH APPLYING 
 
                     the highest professional standards. Also, I would add another 
 
                     clarifying detail as follows: 3.16 Ensure that trade-offs 
 
                     and quality limitations have been disclosed to the client 
 
                     or employer where there have been trade-offs between goals 
 
                     or quality limitations due to cost or time or other feasibility 
 
                     limits. - Dan Evans danevans@compuserve.com </p>

                   <p>Voting Options: B- Affirmative (comments optional) Given 
 
                     the pervasive issue of privacy or use of individually identifiable 
 
                     information, the one mention in 3.12 under emphasizes the 
 
                     need to balance organizational and individual concerns. Would 
 
                     measuring a project's specifications against the OECD Privacy 
 
                     Guidelines be too specific? While we can't address something 
 
                     as specific as the Year 2000 issue, where and how would you 
 
                     expect that issue to be analyzed in the Code3F One might encounter 
 
                     it in 3.02 or 3.03, but not very clearly. Why not add the 
 
                     word &quot;anticipate&quot; appropriately somewhere. The word 
 
                     &quot;standard&quot; is used in different ways inthe document. 
 
                     Other words could be choses that are more specific. The one 
 
                     place technical standards are referred to (3.06) the word 
 
                     is modified by &quot;industry&quot;. What does th ephrse 'industry

                   <p>What kind of guidance is this supposed to give? Given IEEE's

                     support for voluntary standards, why is this so weak? Technical 
 
                     standards have different roles, shouldn't there at least be 
 
                     a specific directive to follow approved standards whwn health, 
 
                     safety and environmental issues are involved? </p>

                   <p>Comments: While I find the 8 principles of the proposed SWE 
 
                     Code of Ethics more or less acceptable, there are at least 
 
                     two short2C simple, and to the point codes of ethics that 
 
                     are quite suitable for software engineers; there is no real 
 
                     need to have a different, separate code: D The Code of Ethics 
 
                     of the Quality Assurance Institute in Orlando FL (http://www.qaiusa.com/certification/code-of-ethics.html) 
 
                     and D The IEEE Code of Ethics. Both codes cover everything 
 
                     a professional should need to be concerned about and say it 
 
                     concisely. My understanding is that the proposed SWE code 
 
                     of ethics is intended to be part of a package of &quot;Software 
 
                     Engineering as a Profession.&quot; It is much too detailed 
 
                     to be useful or usable. I am trying to understand it in its 
 
                     intended context. </p>
 
                   <p>QUESTIONS: 1. To whom does this code apply? Those who pass 
 
                     some licensing or cert!ification exam? 2. Then, who takes 
 
                     the exam? Experienced people already in the field? Fresh graduates 
 
                     of college or other training programs? D 3. Is this intended 
 
                     for managers? Or, the lowest level programmer, who may not 
 
                     even have an idea of project costs or many other DETAILS specified 
 
                     in the code? 4. I believe I have always behaved ethically, 
 
                     but as a new college graduate, I would never have considered 
 
                     or been involved in most of the issues addressed by these 
 
                     details. I maintain that as a young person I wouldn't have 
 
                     had any idea what the details of the proposed code imply. 
 
                     Are today's young people that much more sophisticated, and 
 
                     do they get exposed to all the details of every project as 
 
                     soon as they join a company?</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: 5. But, the IEEE Code, yes, I believe 
 
                     I live by those, and have done so all my life. 6. What are 
 
                     the consequences of NOT following this code? Removal of one's 
 
                     license or certif!ication? In what body would a removal decision 
 
                     reside? 7. Some points go beyond the domain of professional 
 
                     ethics and intrude on one's private life. Example: While we 
 
                     may all believe that doing voluntary is something we should 
 
                     do, it certainly is outside a professional code to mandate 
 
                     voluntary work2C as stated in 1.08. Then, that work would 
 
                     not be &quot;voluntary!&quot; Please, simplify this code, 
 
                     or reduce it to strictly the 8 principles. Preferably, use 
 
                     either of the two existing codes identified in this ballot.

                     is no explicit requirement to report potential security weaknesses 
 
                     or suspected breaches; a complementary clause, 5.03, under

                     explicitly as an additional item under 2 the wording of 4.04 
 
                     is a little odd - bribery surely is an example of an improper 
 
                     financial practice rather than a deceptive one - i.e. rearrange 
 
                     the sentence to &quot;deceptive financial practices such as 
 
                     double billing and improper practices such as bribery&quot;? 
 
                     clause 4.05 is not clear that conflicts of interest that can 
 
                     be avoided or escaped (what's the difference?) should be - 
 
                     some rewording seems desirable - no specific suggestions </p>

                     different values. Perhaps it should say something like &quot;values

                   <p>Comments: 1.02 &quot;public good&quot; is a vague phrase 
 
                     that can mean almost anything. The code gives no guidance 
 
                     for understanding this crucial term. 1.07 &quot;Physical disabilities&quot; 
 
                     are not relevant, or at least are not clearly explained. 2.05 
 
                     As above, &quot;consistent with the public good&quot; is too 
 
                     vague. 6.06 This is a major problem. As written, it is an 
 
                     invitation to anarchy, again because the code provides no 
 
                     guidance - no ethical context - for judging when the public 
 
                     interest is at stake.</p>
 
                   <p> 6.12 At what point does the engineer put his pragmatic personal 
 
                     interest above the common good? If he/she is to do so here, 
 
                     why not elsewhere in the code? What singles out this particular 
 
                     instruction for a self-interest exception? I have two general 
 
                     objections: As the particulars above show, the code is insufficiently 
 
                     precise in my opinion to offer real guidance to software professionals 
 
                     in facing a!nd resolving ethical dilemmas. The code in fact 
 
                     creates more dilemmas than it solves because it is so vague. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Secondly, and related to the first, is that with few exceptions 
 
                     this could be a code for any profession. There is little in 
 
                     here that speaks to the particular ethical problems faced 
 
                     by computer professionals - those dealing with the nature 
 
                     of the computer itself, its distancing effect on its users, 
 
                     its ability to malform data, its potential for invasions of 
 
                     privacy, and so forth. I feel that to be useful to software 
 
                     engineers (as opposed to professionals in general), the code 
 
                     must address and give guidance on those issues of ethics that 
 
                     are unique to the computer field. </p>

                   <p>Comments: Aspiration 1 - strike ALWAYS or place in each aspiration. 
 
                     Rationale: These are all aspirations that should ALWAYS be 
 
                     followed. To single out just the first promotes inconsistency 
 
                     in application.0D Aspiration 3 is too weak - is is not just 
 
                     meet high standards but also the same kind of ethical approach 
 
                     as in Aspiration 5. I'd strongly suggest splitting Aspiration 
 
                     3 into two parts: Professional standards (highest professional 
 
                     standards) and ethical approach (as in 5). </p>
 
                   <p>It is not just management that should be held to an ethical 
 
                     standard. 3.05 is shallow - ensure a methodology doesn't say 
 
                     anything. Ensure an appropriate methodology is consistently 
 
                     applied is more forthright. This is the crucial difference 
 
                     between process definitions as doorstops and as documents 
 
                     that guide the projects. 6.03 is going to be exceedingly difficult 
 
                     for us to comply with, as IEEE-SA is not exacting a su!rcharge/fee 
 
                     (enacted without representation of the membership) to allow 
 
                     us to continue to participate in standards activities.</p>
 
                   <p> Their actions are inconsistent with ethical behavior on 
 
                     the part of responsible software engineers.0D 8.02 Insert 
 
                     &quot;usable,&quot; after &quot;reliable,&quot; - if it is 
 
                     useful, but usable, software cannot be used by people.</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: In general, I find that this is lacking 
 
                     in the issues of ethical products (see my earlier comment 
 
                     about splitting aspiration 3). Things like usability, privacy, 
 
                     security, safety, that relate to the product itself and its 
 
                     intended use should be addressed explicitly. For example, 
 
                     is software that allows identity theft or password snooping 
 
                     ethicaly correct software that a software engineer should 
 
                     be developing? What about trap doors or back doors? 3.03 starts 
 
                     to get at some of this, but needs expansion. </p>

                   <p>Comments: CHANGES REQUIRED FOR MY APPROVAL OF THIS CODEA 
 
                     3.06. Work to follow industry standards when available that 
 
                     are most appropriate for the task at hand, departing from 
 
                     these only when technically justified. I object to the use 
 
                     of the word &quot;technically&quot; in this clause. There 
 
                     are other justifications for departing from a standard, including 
 
                     economic cost/benefit tradeoffs for the customer, marketing 
 
                     or positioning justification for the employer, etc. Open standards 
 
                     and Ethics are separate issues, and a code of ethics and professional 
 
                     behavior is not a place to push open standards. Suggested 
 
                     re-wording: &quot;Work to follow industry standards when available 
 
                     that are most appropriate for the task at hand, departing 
 
                     from these only when justified.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>3.08. Ensure that specifications for software on which they 
 
                     work have been well documented, satisfy the users' requirements, 
 
                     and hav!e the appropriate approvals. Documentation of the 
 
                     specification is not always requred, depending on the project 
 
                     or level of granularity of the feature involved. In addition, 
 
                     the specification should satisfy the requirements of the client, 
 
                     which are a complex mix of end-user requirements, system administrator 
 
                     requirements, marketing requirements, etc. Also, there are 
 
                     customers of the specification who are not necessarily customers 
 
                     of the final product. These include those writing documentation, 
 
                     sales staff, support staffC developers, etc. Suggested re-wording: 
 
                     &quot;Ensure that specifications for software on which they 
 
                     work have been appropriately documented, satisfy the customers' 
 
                     requirements, and have the appropriate approvals.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>A 6.10. Avoid associations with disreputable businesses and 
 
                     organizations. What does &quot;disreputable&quot; mean? There 
 
                     is no absolute standard for disrepute, so how can we !hold 
 
                     someone to a clause that presumes such a standard? To some, 
 
                     Microsoft is disreputable these days, yet I feel completely 
 
                     ethically justified in everything I do working here. How about 
 
                     changing this to: &quot;Avoid associations with businesses 
 
                     and organizations that the software engineer judges to be 
 
                     disreputable.&quot; EDITORIAL COMMENTS, NOT REQUIRED FOR MY 
 
                     APPROVAL OF THIS CODE: 1.04. Disclose to appropriate persons 
 
                     or authorities any actual or potential danger to the user, 
 
                     the public, or the environment, that they reasonably believe 
 
                     to be associated with software or related documents. As we 
 
                     all know, software that ships contains bugs. Some bugs are 
 
                     known at the time of shipment.</p>
 
                   <p> Whether to ship the software with the bugs involves trade-offs 
 
                     where the benefit of shipping is weighed against the benefit 
 
                     of slipping the schedule to fix the bug, and the corresponding 
 
                     risks of introducing new and possibly unknow!n bugs in the 
 
                     process. Software engineers use their judgement to make the 
 
                     appropriate trade-offs, and although every effort is made 
 
                     to eliminate bugs that could cause &quot;potential danger&quot;, 
 
                     some bugs known to have this potential inevitably remain in 
 
                     the product. Generally, the decision to leave such a bug in 
 
                     the product is a result of the vanishingly small chance of 
 
                     encountering the bug. In some cases, communicating the bug 
 
                     could cause more harm than not communicating it. For example, 
 
                     a bug that potentially causes data loss can be devastating 
 
                     to a customer, but it must be weighed against the cumulative 
 
                     benefit the customer will receive from using the software 
 
                     in the case where the product works properly.</p>
 
                   <p> I would like to see a more specific definition of &quot;actual 
 
                     or potential danger,&quot; and a caveat that the consequences 
 
                     of disclosing the defect should be weighed against the consequences 
 
                     of not disclosing the defect. </p>

                   <p>Comments: Nonbinding, editorial comments. 1. I would appreciate 
 
                     it if a technical editor reviewed the document. There are 
 
                     a number of grammatical or stylistic issues that I am slightly 
 
                     uncomfortable with2C without preparing to say they are incorrect 
 
                     usages. 2. Global change, specifically in the preamble to 
 
                     both versions. &quot;Development&quot; should include the 
 
                     other activities listed. I would prefer a term such as &quot;programming&quot; 
 
                     or &quot;coding&quot; in the string: &quot;analysis, specification, 
 
                     designC development, testing and maintenance.&quot; 3. The 
 
                     use of &quot;act consistent with in principles 1 and 2 grates.</p>
 
                   <p> In principle 1, it seems like it should be &quot;consistently&quot;. 
 
                     Principle 2 might sound better as &quot;that is consistent.&quot; 
 
                     4. Global change: &quot;client&quot; to &quot;customer&quot; 
 
                     would, I think, be more consistent with current international 
 
                     standards usage. 5. Principle 5: 2administration of software 
 
                     development&quot; should be &quot;management of software development 
 
                     and maintenance.&quot; Subpoint 1 - this should be managementC 
 
                     not administration. I distinguish between the two! Subpoint 
 
                     2 - I prefer &quot;development and maintenance&quot; universally 
 
                     or &quot;software engineering.&quot; 6. 2.06, too many to's 
 
                     -- should be &quot;to fail, prove too expensive, violate intellectual 
 
                     property legislation, ...&quot; 7. 3.03, &quot;work projects&quot; 
 
                     should be &quot;software projects.&quot; 8. 3.04, &quot;education, 
 
                     planned education&quot; seems pretty meaningless. Better would 
 
                     be &quot;education, training, ...&quot; 9. A lot of the &quot;ensure22 
 
                     clauses seem awkwardly worded. Are software professionals 
 
                     &quot;ensuring&quot; or &quot;doing?&quot; For example, 3.09 
 
                     &quot;ensure realistic estimates&quot; should probably be 
 
                     either &quot;provided realistic estimates&quot; or &quot;ensure 
 
                     realistic estimates are provided.&quot; A global c!omment 
 
                     (or question). </p>

                   <p>Comments: Your preable misses out an important stage: implementation. 
 
                     It's also a specific point at which ethical conflicts may 
 
                     arise. You seem to imply that public interest overrides corporate 
 
                     policy, and that the ethical programmer has a responsibility 
 
                     to obey the higher ethic. While I agree, this invokes two 
 
                     considerations. First, a specific individual may have formed 
 
                     his or her own ideal of public benefit, and release information 
 
                     based on well meaning, but private, adgenas. Particularly 
 
                     in dealing with sensitive matters, this could generate an 
 
                     insolvable dynamic. Second2C without some means of censure, 
 
                     any idividual who does 'blow the whistle7 is naturally going 
 
                     to invoke censure. Both of these issues could, I thinkC be 
 
                     addressed by establishing a more formal methodology for resolving 
 
                     ethical dilemmas; by having some form of support for individuals 
 
                     caught in this position; and by a formal system of !priniples 
 
                     acceptable to the company stating, in effect, that they accept 
 
                     their employees' concerns. {It's well and good to be a pacifist, 
 
                     but when the sargent tells you to go over the top, you go...}</p>
 
                   <p> In generalC I find the tone to be a bit high and mighty, 
 
                     but I do understand that this is hard to avoid. Personally, 
 
                     I like a bit of dogmatism, with, perhaps, a few teeth to sharpen 
 
                     the goals... Hope the comments are satisfactory; I most assuredly 
 
                     approve of the goals. </p>

                     reflects the professional views I endorse. I particularly0D 
 
                     like Full Version Preamble paragraph 4. Significant: 2.02 
 
                     Unclear - what is unethically obtained software? I cannot 
 
                     endorse this principle in general if it refers to the general 
 
                     licencing / piracy-for-use-not-resale issue. It requires an

                     is subsumed in 6.06. Therefore omit it as in no other 0Aparagraphs 
 
                     of principles are instances of 6.06 spelled out. My reasoning: 
 
                     there are circumstances when using unlicenced software is 
 
                     justified ethically even though it might not be illegal. Therefore 
 
                     the professional code should not exclude it categorically. 
 
                     Example 1: the industry argument that all copied software 
 
                     is lost revenue is, of course, self serving. If you cannot 
 
                     afford the !software you would not buy it, you would merely 
 
                     go without. In such circumstances, copying software does not 
 
                     negatively affect intellectual property holders. No harm done.</p>
 
                   <p> Not using it could go against public good. For example, 
 
                     a one person startup operation might not have enough capital. 
 
                     Failing to startup is negative, economically, and, therefore, 
 
                     not good forD society. Ethics suggests that, once one can 
 
                     afford it, one should become licenced. Meanwhile you are illegal 
 
                     but doing good and will become a future paying software consumer. 
 
                     The key to such arguments as this is the fundamental difference 
 
                     between intellectual property and other property. For goods 
 
                     that, if taken, are no longer available to the owner, no such 
 
                     justification could, generally, be made. With software, if 
 
                     the situation is merely pirate it or do without, then pirating 
 
                     is justified if the public good is better served by havi!ng 
 
                     it rather than not having it. Example 2: it may be difficult 
 
                     or impossible to acquire the SW legally: old versions - Windows 
 
                     3.x and applications for 4MB machines; DOS applications - 
 
                     may not be available in your local market. This is common 
 
                     in such markets as this one and other countries in Africa. 
 
                     Suppliers are not very informed and supported product range 
 
                     is severely restricted. </p>
 
                   <p>Here, organizational ineffectiveness, poor lines of supply, 
 
                     ineffective or dishonest suppliers, etc, make acquisition 
 
                     of intellectual property products problematic, delayed and, 
 
                     commonly, overpriced. Shall we copy the old software we purchased 
 
                     in the past or simply go without? Example 3: textbooks -- 
 
                     another kind of intellectual property -- commonly DO NOT arrive 
 
                     on time or AT ALL even though they have been contracted for 
 
                     and would be paid for. It may violate copyright to lend photocopies 
 
                     to the students! but is it unethical? Shall the students go 
 
                     uneducated? Shall professional development in the country 
 
                     flag? Example 4: the wording of licence agreements is overly 
 
                     restrictive anyway. </p>
 
                   <p>A private consultant cannot use licenced SW on her office 
 
                     and home computers without paying twice without some ridiculous 
 
                     requirement of deinstalling and reinstalling even though there 
 
                     is no concurrent use! This wording is not in the public interest 
 
                     and non compliance - ie. installing anywhere but limiting 
 
                     concurrent use to number of licences - doesn't seem unethical 
 
                     to me. Example 5: some - most - software is now supplied by 
 
                     monopoly suppliers and users have no choice. Yet there are 
 
                     no regulatory bodies that enforce good service, or price controls, 
 
                     on the monopoly providers. In remote markets, like this one, 
 
                     there is virtually no product support; something that is part 
 
                     of the product price. Sometimes it !is worse than that. A 
 
                     specific example: A bought Visual Basic and it was delivered 
 
                     on many 3.5&quot; diskettes. The diskettes failed so A sent 
 
                     them back to the supplier. Much time passed. </p>
 
                   <p>Eventually they delivered replacements - on CD, which, at 
 
                     that time A could not use. Has A received what A paid for? 
 
                     Should A copy someone else's software? Another specific example: 
 
                     B received 10 Pentium machines with CD installed but no software 
 
                     medium; ie. no installation CDs or diskettes. B was expected 
 
                     to cut B's own 3.5 diskettes - about 35 of them. Another vendor 
 
                     gave B a Windows 95 CD which B subsequently used for *all* 
 
                     of the machines. So, while B had, factory installed, licenced 
 
                     software, B used illegal unlicenced software. Our identity 
 
                     has been protected in both the previous examples. Does the 
 
                     code expect one to ethically follow the exact &quot;legal&quot; 
 
                     licencing arrangements in such situations and! &quot;not knowingly 
 
                     use&quot; &quot;illegal&quot; software? Options in order of 
 
                     preference: 1. Omit 2.02 2. Alternate wording &quot;. . . 
 
                     illegally or unethically, unless, in exceptional circumstances, 
 
                     such avoidance is inconsistent with the public interest.&quot; 
 
                     As I said, 2.02 seems to be subsumed in 6.06. 3. Second alternate 
 
                     wording: &quot;Work to not knowingly use . . .&quot;. It appears 
 
                     that the use of &quot;Work to&quot; in section 3 - eg. 3.12 
 
                     - means &quot;do your best&quot; rather than &quot;thou shalt&quot;. 
 
                     &quot;Privacy&quot; seems to be a topic on which the code 
 
                     takes a ambivalent stand. So it should on licencing. 2.08 
 
                     Reword: &quot;Accept no outside work detrimental to the normal 
 
                     work they perform. . .&quot; The work &quot;normal&quot; has 
 
                     been added. Employers often expect IT professionals to work 
 
                     late nights, weekends2C holidays, particularly when late on 
 
                     a contract which often was acquired by low bidding and allowing 
 
                     i!nsufficient resources to complete in normal working hours. 
 
                     Other aspects of this scenario are not ones I wish to take 
 
                     up with respect to ethics but the employer does not have the 
 
                     &quot;ethical&quot; right to insist the employee give up his 
 
                     weekend job. This is a matter of contract negotiation between 
 
                     them. The ethical issue applies only to &quot;normal&quot; 
 
                     working conditions and should 0Abe explicit in the code, given 
 
                     the nature of our profession.</p>
 
                   <p> Suggestion: 5.13 Add an additional management principle, 
 
                     related to the general principle 8 which addresses the important 
 
                     concept of lifelong learning. We need a principle that management 
 
                     facilitates this practice in the workplace. Perhaps 5.04 is 
 
                     intended to address this but, if so, it is not clear. &quot;5.13 
 
                     Encourage and enable professional development and life long 
 
                     learning.&quot; Renumber items as you see fit. Suggestion: 
 
                     6.10 Reword: &quot;Avoid! unnecessary association with disreputable 
 
                     businesses and organizations.&quot; AThe word &quot;unnecessary&quot; 
 
                     is added. Recall the ideas of detente with the &quot;evil 
 
                     empire&quot; and constructive engagement with the apartheid 
 
                     regime - which was not a good thing but that's another matter. 
 
                     Perhaps &quot;Avoid&quot; is sufficiently non-imperative .

                   <p>Comments: Binding Content Comments In Clause 4.02, the inclusion 
 
                     of &quot;under their supervision or&quot; should be removed. 
 
                     The fact that work is prepared under one's supervision does 
 
                     not necessarily enable one to be able to &quot;endorse&quot; 
 
                     the work. Such endorsement should only be offered if the remaining 
 
                     portions of the clause hold true, even when supervising such 
 
                     work. In Clause 5.07, qualification should be included since 
 
                     many managers have no control over compensation. We might 
 
                     try something like: &quot;Work to assure fair and just remuneration 
 
                     for all participants, where such factors are within the manager's 
 
                     control.&quot; Non-Binding Content Comments Principles 2 &amp; 
 
                     6 both end with &quot;consistent with the public interest.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p> Does this need to be explicit? The Preamble to the full 
 
                     version points out that ALL clauses need to be interpreted 
 
                     and used in such a way. Why single out these two Pri!nciples? 
 
                     Clause 1.02 provides explicitly for such cross-considerations. 
 
                     I would remove the sub-clauses from Principles 2 &amp; 6. 
 
                     The same should be considered in Clause 2.06. In Clause 4.06, 
 
                     I feel the verb &quot;refuse&quot; is a bit strong. I would 
 
                     prefer &quot;decline.&quot; Editorial Comments The first paragraph 
 
                     of the Preamble of the Short Version actually differentiates 
 
                     the short from full versions and so should not be included 
 
                     in the Preamble of the short. I would move the paragraph up 
 
                     to precede the Short Version heading. </p>
 
                   <p>The style seems to have been chosen to capitalize Code, Principle, 
 
                     and Clause when self-referencing this document. If so, it 
 
                     should be applied more consistently throughout the document. 
 
                     The Preamble to the Full Version is too long. I would insert 
 
                     an additional heading, INTRODUCTION2C after the first paragraph 
 
                     of this Preamble.</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: The authors have done an exceptional 
 
                     job. My c!omments above are trivial when compared to the amount 
 
                     of work and thought that has obviously gone into this effort.

                   <p>Comments: My vote is affirmative, with reservations.D Computer 
 
                     software is engineering in the sense that technical knowledge 
 
                     is being used to create something for use by individuals who 
 
                     do not have that knowledge. This is a position of trust; ethical 
 
                     behavior is important. Having said that, I question whether 
 
                     having a published code of ethics is required. Would a code 
 
                     of ethics prevent the failure of software products? In the 
 
                     past, the major software failings have been caused by a failure 
 
                     in engineering, not ethics. I suspect that future failures 
 
                     will follow the same pattern. Does the proposed code of ethics 
 
                     speak to existing questions of software ethics? I think of 
 
                     the debate concerning President Reagan's proposed antimissile 
 
                     shield. On the one handC the argument was that software professionals 
 
                     should not work on a project which had so little chance of0D 
 
                     success. The other argument was that a well-funded failure 
 
                     would produce impressive advances in software. </p>
 
                   <p>As I read the code, it states that the 0Aethical engineer 
 
                     should state that the project has little chance of success.D 
 
                     After making that statement, the ethical engineer may continue 
 
                     drawing 0Aa paycheck. The best parts of the proposed code 
 
                     are the long preamble and the short list of principles. The 
 
                     long list of principles is detailed enough to raise the temptation 
 
                     of loop-hole searching. I would feel better about this if 
 
                     I knew that the mechanical engineers had a code of ethics. 
 
                     This knowledge would speak to my suspicion that the proposed 
 
                     code is an effort to duplicate the public relations effort 
 
                     that changed land office salesmen into realtors. To change 
 
                     the subject, I have recently agreed to serve as treasurer 
 
                     for my church. I have been assured that the position involves 
 
                     over-seeingD assistants that are well qualified to perform 
 
                     the clerical parts of the Ajob. In particular, the pastor's 
 
                     wife will do the payroll on bootleg software from Dennis's 
 
                     business. To repeat, affirmative, with reservations.</p>

                     4.03 Nowhere in the Code I was able to find examples with 
 
                     the ambiguous wording &quot;such as ... or other ...&quot;. 
 
                     To be coherent with the overall Code, wording as above must 
 
                     be avoided. I suggest to reword the Principle 4.04 as follows: 
 
                     &quot;Avoid financial practices prosecuted from enforced laws&quot;.
