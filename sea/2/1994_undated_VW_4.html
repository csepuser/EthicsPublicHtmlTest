       <p>WHAT BALANCE BETWEEN TECHNICAL STANDARDS, PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS, AND
         PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION?
       <p><br>
   Last year the IEEE Computer Society and the ACM??the world two largest organizations
     of computing practitioners (combined membership of more than 175,0001??formed
     a Joint Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering
     as a Profession. In so doing, they created an opportunity to study a profession
     coming into being??and, given the size and importance of the organizations
     involved, an opportunity not likely to be repeated soon. They also created
     an opportunity for scholars concerned with professions to make their research
     available to members of a profession at a crucial moment. We propose to seize
     that opportunity before it is lost.<br>
   The Joint Steering Committee established three task forces. One is to identify
   the body of knowledge and recommended practices that constitute the expertise
   of the new profession. A second is to define a curriculum for the training
   of members of the new profession (or, at least, set certain minimum educational
   standards). The third is to document and codify ethical and professional practices
   for members of the new profession. Each of these task forces is supposed to
   complete work by November 1995. Once the three report, they will be faced with
   the complex task of integrating ideas about what the technical knowledge of
   the profession is with what its professional and educational standards should
   be. What they decide may have substantial effects on who can engage in software
   development, what is expected of them, and what they have a right to expect
   of their employers. The Joint Committee will, in effect, be faced with a practical
   version of one of the deepest problems in the theory of professionalism, determining
   how much of professionalism is (or should be) adherence to technical standards,
   how much having the appropriate training, and how much maintaining ethical
   standards.<br>
   We might illustrate the problem with an example. Bugs are a problem in software.
   They can be a serious problem, especially when the software runs an important
   business function like check writing or a piece of equipment that can cause
   great harm if it works improperly. No complex software is free of bugs. Testing
   can remove most, but testing is expensive. How much testing is enough? There
   are several ways to answer this question. One is for the software maker to
   adopt an organizational standard like the Capability Maturity Model (developed
   at Carnegie?Mellon's Software Engineering Institute [ref?]). That will, however,
   not necessarily provide a complete answer. There are various stages in the
   adoption of this model. Few companies are anywhere near the highest stage:
   and even the highest stage can't guarantee that software won't fail disastrously.
   Another way to answer the question is to have degree?granting institutions
   teach certain testing procedures as standard practice, assuring that the software
   developers they graduate will routinely use those procedures whether their
   companies think to require them or not. A third way is to make it part of being
   a (professional) software developer that you will not sign off on a piece of
   software unless satisfied that it has been satisfactorily tested. Since a professional's
   being satisfied is not merely a matter of whether the test meets recommended
   technical standards (though it generally means at least that), such an ethical
   standard provides another way of protecting end?users. Such protection is important
   in a field, like software development, where change has been so fast that the
   technical standards have often been one or two steps behind the technology.<br>
   These three ways of answering the question of how much to test are, of course,
   not necessarily inconsistent. But there is a tension between them.<br>
   Because software development is such a large field, we propose to focus in
   this first exploratory research on only one part of the field, testing of software
   for safety and reliability. This sub?field corresponds to one of the working
   groups the task force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices
   has set up??as well as to a specialty in software development itself. We plan
   to attach ourselves to this working group (Reliability and Safety) and follow
   its process from stating the problem, to gathering ideas, to deliberation,
   to final recommendation, to dissolution. We hope this will lead to a larger
   project that picks up from there. We envisage a more open?ended sequel following
   in part, the working group's<br>
   recommendations through the task force's deliberations, the deliberations of
   the<br>
   Joint Committee, and so on until finalresolution (presumably, approval by the
   IEEE and ACM).</p>
       <p><br>
   We have formed a research team consisting of three members and three consultants
     to carry out our initial research plan.</p>
       <p><br>
   The members are Ilene Burnstein (CS, an expert on program testing), Michael
     Davis (CSEP, an expert on business ethics and codes of ethics), and Vivian
     Weil (CSEP, expert on engineering ethics). The two consultants are Ullica
     Segerstrale (a social scientist working in science studies and Barry Weiss
     (a lawyer versed in software liability issues).</p>
       <p><br>
   Our research plan has four parts:<br>
   1. The working group on reliability and testing plans to do most of its work
   by e?mail, with only a few face?to?face meetings. We can therefore study its
   work in large part by reading its mail (which is supposed to be open to everyone).
   We would complement reading the mail by telephone interview from time to time
   a) to clear up matters e?mail leaves unclear and b) to make sure we aren't
   missing anything important (for example, the fruit of phone conversations or
   an informal chat at a conference). We would also participate in the few face?to?face
   meetings (whether these turn out to be at conferences or by teleconference).</p>
       <p><br>
   2. The three members of the research team will meet monthly to analyze the
     process recorded in e?mail (and what we have learned by phone). We will be
     especially concerned to identify issues in need of further study. Some of
     this will simply be factual: for example, if an e?mail message refers to
     a technical standard none of us recognizes, we would have to ask the most
     appropriate member of the research group to find out what it is and why it
     matters. Some of the further study will, however, be of a different order:
     for example, if an e?mail message claims that a certain testing procedure
     makes ethical standards of a certain sort unnecessary (without explaining
     that claim), we might want to ask the author for an explanation; and, if
     asking fails to generate a satisfactory one, may want to search the literature
     for a rationale in order to assess the claim. We will call upon the consultants
     as need for information or help in analyzing what we observe.</p>
       <p><br>
   3. This discussion, shadowing the official working group, should help us develop
     our own understanding of the issues with which the working group is dealing,
     an independent expertise. and??given our research group's make?up??a perspective
     importantly different from the official working group's &quot;insider&quot; perspective.
     While we don't expect our view to be opposed to the (initial) views of the
     official working group, we do expect it to be different enough to be useful
     now and then, more because it will pick out or emphasizes considerations
     insiders may overlook or, at least, fail to appreciate, than because of any
     fundamental disagreement.</p>
       <p><br>
   4. Once the working group completes its work, we will prepare a report summarizing
     and analyzing their work. The draft will be submitted to our consults for
     comment and suggestions.</p>
       <p>We expect this research to have at least four outcomes:</p>
       <p> <br>
   1. The report of what we have observed during the year of our initial study.
     This should take the form a) of a report to the ACM and IEEE and b) of one
     or more research publications. We expect these research publications to contribute
     to at least three fields: the sociology of professions: professional ethics:
     and (perhaps) technical management.</p>
       <p><br>
   2. Enough contacts, experience, and insight to propose a larger project to
     stud the larger process of professiona1izing software developers of which
     the working group activity is but a small part. Such a proposal would, of
     course, be contingent on the success of this project, but also on our making
     a determination, impossible to make now, about how much a larger project
     is likely to add to what we have
   already learned about the relation of individual responsibility, technical
   standards,<br>
   and professional ethics.</p>
       <p><br>
   3. Ideas for doing a better job of teaching testing to future software developers,
     whether trained in an engineering or computer science department. We expect
     these ideas to emerge from the continual contact between members of our interdisciplinary
     research team as they work together in the unusual circumstance of observing
     a new set of professional standards (and a new profession) coming into existence
     . We therefore view this project as, among other things, an aid to revising
     courses (or adding new ones) to better educate the next generation of software
     developers. Whatever useful ideas come out of our interdisciplinary meetings
     would, of course, also be published in an appropriate place??and may, then,
     lead as well to new ideas for improving the continuing education of today's
     software developers.</p>
       <p><br>
   4. Ideas the Joint Committee, its task force, or working group may find useful.
     Because the Joint Committee has adopted an open process, allowing everyone
     to read the committee debate (on e?mail) and to respond, we hope to participate
     in that debate as well as monitor it, not only asking questions both substantive
     and procedural (for our benefit) but asking or answering questions for the
     benefit of the important work the Joint Committee is engaged in.</p>
       <p><br>
   We have discussed our proposal with both Donald Gotterbarn the task force's
     ACM Co?Chair, and Robert Melford, the task force's IEEE?CS CO?Chair. Both
     have welcomed us potential participants as well as observers. [VW: what about
     Keith Miller, Sagamon State, the working group chair?]</p>
