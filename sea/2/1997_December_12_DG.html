   SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE IEEE-CS/ACM Joint
   Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices<br>
   Short Version (Version 4.0)<br>
   Software engineers must commit themselves to making the analysis, specification,
   design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected
   profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare
   of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:</p>
       <p><br>
   1 PUBLIC - Software engineers shall always act in the public interest.</p>
       <p>2 CLIENT
       OR EMPLOYER - Software engineers shall act in the best interests of their
       client or employer within the confines of the public interest.</p>
       <p> 3 PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and
         related modifications are of the highest professional standards possible.</p>
       <p> 4 JUDGEMENT - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and<br>
   independence in their professional judgment.</p>
       <p> 5 MANAGEMENT - Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe
         to and promote an ethical approach to the administration of software
         development. </p>
       <p>6 PROFESSION - Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation
         of the profession within the confines of the public interest. </p>
       <p>7 COLLEAGUES - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of
         their colleagues. </p>
       <p>8 SELF - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding
         the practice of their profession. feel the lack of warning not to treat
         this short version as a complete code of ethics is a fatal flaw. It would
         be easy to add a line that it is not the complete code, and is only an
         'aide memoire' for the full version, which itself is not intended to
         be used so that individual parts in isolation could justify errors of
         omission or commission.<br>
   SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE Full Version </p>
       <p>Version 4.0) PREAMBLE OK, as said above.<br>
   PRINCIPLES -<br>
   Principle 1 PUBLIC Software engineers shall always act in the public interest.
   In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate: Improved.</p>
       <p>1.02. Balance
     the interests of the software engineer, the employer, the client and the
         users with the public good.<br>
     I am not happy with this change. Cf old 2.07. I would prefer &quot;Moderate
     pursuit of the interests of the software engineer, the employer, the client
     and the users with pursuit of the public good.&quot;</p>
       <p>1.04. Disclose to appropriate
     persons or authorities any actual or potential danger to the user, the public,
     or the environment, that they reasonably believe
     to be associated with software or related documents.<br>
     The deletion of &quot;or merely know about&quot; is detrimental, although the
     deletion of the word 'merely', itself, is appropriate. Consider issues of physical
     disabilities, allocation of resources, economic disadvantage and other factors
     that can diminish access to the<br>
     benefits of software. Loss of the mentions of language and 'mental access'
     is detrimental, even if the earlier version was poorly expressed. I prefer:</p>
       <p>1.07.
     Endeavour to produce software that respects diversity. Consider issues including
     those of language, economic advantage, allocation of
           resources,
       and different abilities (including how to make software usable by people
       with physical and sensory impairments, learning difficulties, and conditions
       such as epilepsy).</p>
       <p><br>
   Principle 2 CLIENT OR EMPLOYER Software engineers shall act in the best interests<br>
   of their client or employer within the confines of the public interest. In
   particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate: This has been improved.</p>
       <p><br>
   2.01. Provide service in their areas of competence, being honest and forthright
     about any limitations of their experience and education. An improvement on
     the old 4.01</p>
       <p>2.02. Not knowingly use software that is obtained or retained
       either illegally or unethically. An improvement on the old 4.04</p>
       <p>2.04. Ensure that any document
     upon which they rely has been approved, when required, by someone authorized
     to approve it. A mild improvement on the old
     4.02</p>
       <p>2.05. Keep private any confidential information gained in their professional
     work, where such confidentiality is consistent with the public interest.
         A mild improvement on the old 4.05</p>
       <p>2.07. Identify, document, and report significant
     issues of social concern, of which they are aware, in software or related
         documents to the employer or
     the client. A mild improvement on the old 4.06</p>
       <p>2.09. Promote no interest adverse
     to their employer or client, unless a higher ethical concern is being compromised;
     in that case, inform the employer or
     another appropriate authority of the ethical concern.<br>
     A mild improvement on the old 4.09</p>
       <p><br>
   Principle 3 PRODUCT Software engineers shall ensure that their products and
     related modifications are of the highest professional standards possible.
     In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
       <p>The removal of detail
       improves the sentence. However, loss of the mention of products being *acceptable*,
       to to the employer, the client, the user and the
     public
     creates a deficiency with the code: it should have become a clause.<br>
       <br>
       3.01. Strive for high quality, acceptable cost and a reasonable schedule,
       ensuring significant tradeoffs are clear to the employer, the client, the
       user and the
     public.<br>
     Making tradeoffs clear is *not* sufficient to compensate for the loss of
     the call to strive for high quality and acceptable cost for the employer,
     client,
     user, and public.</p>
       <p>I also wonder if the wording is *accidentally* deficient
     in the way it implies &quot;employer,
     the client, the user and the public&quot; only applies to tradeoffs, not to &quot;high
     quality, acceptable cost and a reasonable schedule&quot;. What about re-ordering
     the clause to &quot;3.01 For each of the employer, client, user and the public:
     Strive for high quality, acceptable cost and a reasonable schedule, ensuring
     significant tradeoffs are clear to all parties concerned.&quot;</p>
       <p>3.04. Ensure
     that they are qualified, by an appropriate combination of education, planned
     education, and experience, for any project on which they work or propose
     to work. A mild improvement on the old 1.03</p>
       <p>3.06. Work to follow industry standards
     when available that are most appropriate for the task at hand, departing
         from these only when technically justified.
     A mild improvement on the old 1.15</p>
       <p>3.08. Ensure that specifications for software
     on which they work have been well documented, satisfy the users' requirements,
     and have the appropriate
     approvals. A mild improvement on the old 1.01</p>
       <p>Provide realistic estimates of
     cost, scheduling, personnel, and outcomes on any project on which they work
     or propose to work and provide a risk assessment
     of these estimates.</p>
       <p>It may not be a given software engineer's responsibility
     to *provide* the estimates, but it is always the software engineer's responsibility
     to encourage the provision
     of realistic estimates. The old 1.07 was better than this replacement. </p>
       <p>At new 5.05 it only applies to leaders. How about &quot;3.09 When asked
         for estimates, provide realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, personnel,
         and outcomes on any project on which they work or propose to work and
         provide a risk assessment of these estimates. Argue against any unrealistic
         estimates that the software
   engineer is aware of.&quot;</p>
       <p>Ensure adequate documentation, including significant
     problems discovered and solutions adopted, for any project on which they
         work. An improvement on the
     old 1.08, however, it would read better if the word 'of' were inserted between
     'including' and 'significant'.</p>
       <p>3.12. Work to develop software and related documents
     that respect the privacy of those who will be affected by that software.
         An improvement on the old 1.10</p>
       <p>3.13.
     Be careful to use only accurate data derived by ethical and lawful means,
         and use only in ways properly authorized. An improvement on the old 1.11<br>
     Maintain the integrity of data being sensitive to outdated or flawed occurrences<br>
     An improvement on the old 1.12</p>
       <p>3.15 Treat software maintenance with the same
     professionalism as new development.<br>
     I like this.</p>
       <p>Principle 4 JUDGEMENT Software engineers shall maintain integrity
     and independence in their professional judgment. In particular, software
           engineers shall,
       as appropriate:</p>
       <p>Loss of the mention of &quot;protect the reputation of software
       engineering, provided such protection is consistent with principle 1&quot; is
       detrimental. I wonder whether it should be a clause.</p>
       <p>4.02 Only endorse documents prepared
     under their supervision or within their areas of competence and with which
     they are in agreement. Good. Covers all
     of the old 2.03 and the old 3.02, in a better way. </p>
       <p>4.04. Do not engage in deceptive financial practices such as bribery,
         secret payments and double billing.<br>
   Improves on the old 3.03, 3.04 and 3.05, BUT the new 4.04 DOES NOT FIT WITH<br>
   THE SENTENCE STRUCTURE. (perhaps 'do not' could be replaced by 'never'?).</p>
       <p><br>
   4.06. Refuse to participate, as members or advisors, in a governmental or professional
     body concerned with software related issues, in which they, their employers,
     or their clients have undisclosed potential conflicts of interest. This is
     an improvement but 'conflicts of interest' doesn't seem right to me (can
     you really have a conflict of interest IN a governmental or professional
     body?) I would suggest &quot;... undisclosed interests which could bias or
     appear to bias opinions expressed or actions taken&quot; would be better.</p>
       <p><br>
   Principle 5 MANAGEMENT Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe
     to and promote an ethical approach to the administration of software development.
     In particular, those managing and leading software engineers shall, as appropriate:
     The principle is improved, however, the loss of 1) acting fairly (in general)
     and 2) &quot;enable and encourage those who they lead to meet their own and
     collective obligations, including those under this code&quot; from the code
     as a whole is severely detrimental. They could be a new 5.01 and 5_02 (with
     the following clauses renumbered).</p>
       <p> 5.01 Ensure good management for any project on which they work, including
         effective procedures for promotion of quality and reduction of risk.
       Rightly moved from old 1.06</p>
       <p>5.12. Not punish a software engineer for expressing
           ethical concerns about a project.<br>
         Is a good addition. However, as with the new 5.02, 5.03, 5.06, 5.09,
           5.11 (which<br>
         follow in this email), 5.12 mentions 'software engineer' rather than
           covering all employees. The clauses replaced mentioned all employees,
           and in these cases
     it is<br>
     appropriate. A software engineer may be leading a team that includes people
     other<br>
     than software engineers (for example administrative support). The good software
     engineer should not punish *any* employee for expressing ethical concerns
     about a project, or ask any employee to do anything inconsistent with this
     Code,
     or attract any potential employee other than by full and accurate description
     of the conditions of employment, or hold any employee to standards before
     they are informed of them; etc.</p>
       <p>5.02. Ensure that software engineers are informed
     of standards before being held to them.</p>
       <p>5.03. Ensure that software engineers know the employer's policies
       and procedures for protecting passwords, files, and other confidential
         information.</p>
       <p>5.06. Attract
     potential software engineers only by full and accurate description of the
         conditions of employment.</p>
       <p>5.09. Ensure that there is a fair agreement
     concerning ownership of any software, processes, research, writing, or other
     intellectual property to which a software
     engineer has contributed.</p>
       <p>5.11. Not ask a software engineer to do anything inconsistent
     with this Code.</p>
       <p>Principle-6 PROFESSION Software engineers shall advance the
           integrity and reputation of the profession within the confines of the
           public interest. In particular,
       software engineers shall, as appropriate: Mildly improved.</p>
       <p>THE DELETION OF
       THE OLD 6.07 IS A SERIOUSLY DETRIMENTAL CHANGE TO THE<br>
       SUBSTANCE OF THE CODE.</p>
       <p>6.03. Extend software engineering knowledge by appropriate
     participation in professional organizations, meetings and publications. An
     improvement on the
     old 6.13</p>
       <p>6.04. Support, as members of a profession, other software engineers
     striving to follow this Code.<br>
     An improvement on the old 6.04</p>
       <p>6.06. Obey all laws governing their work, unless,
     in exceptional circumstances, such compliance is inconsistent with the public
     interest.<br>
     Change from old 6.10 is OK</p>
       <p>6.10. Avoid associations with disreputable businesses
     and organizations.<br>
     Change from old 6.01 is OK</p>
       <p>6.11. Consider, as a profession, that violations
     of this Code are inconsistent with being a professional software engineer.
     I do not see how individuals can
     consider 'as a profession'. Those words should be deleted.</p>
       <p>6.12. Express concerns
     to the people involved when significant violations of this Code are detected.<br>
     The words &quot;unless this is impossible, dangerous or ineffective&quot; should
     be added at the end of this clause in addition to having been added to the
     following one.</p>
       <p>6.13. Report significant violations of this Code to appropriate
     authorities when consultation about the problems has proven impossible, dangerous
     or ineffective.</p>
       <p><br>
   Principle 7 COLLEAGUES Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of
     their<br>
   colleagues. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate: A slight
   improvement.</p>
       <p><br>
   7.02. Credit fully the work of others and refrain from taking undue credit.
     An improvement on the old 7.03</p>
       <p>7.06. Not unfairly intervene in the career
       of any colleague; however, concern for the employer, the client or public
       interest may compel software engineers,
     in good faith, to question the competence of a colleague. A big improvement
     on the old 7.07 and 7.08</p>
       <p><br>
   Principle 8 SELF Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning
     regarding the practice of their profession. In particular, software engineers
     shall continually endeavor to: Slightly worse than the previous version.</p>
       <p><br>
   8.01. Further their knowledge of developments in the analysis, specification,
     design, development, maintenance and testing of software and related documents,
     together with the management of the development process. Improved.</p>
       <p><br>
   8.07. Not influence others to undertake any action which involves a breach
     of this Code.<br>
   Improved.</p>
       <p>8.08. Encourage colleagues to adhere to this Code. This doesn't appear
     to me to be suitable for the 'self' principle. The old 8.08. &quot;Consider
     violations of this code inconsistent with being a professional software engineer
     and encourage
     colleagues to adhere to this code.&quot; should be retained, but clarity would
     be improved by the insertion of the word 'personal' after 'consider'. The new
     6.11 does not cover this PERSONAL aspect.<br>
