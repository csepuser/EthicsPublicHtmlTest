       <p>Dear SEEPP Volunteer: Sometime back I sent out a kick-off letter for
         our effort. The letter, appended below, gave a complete approach for
         the development of our standard. It was probably not a good idea to list
         all of the tasks at once. No one knew where to start. To start we need
         to have some folks jump in and pick up particular tasks. I have listed
         them below.
       <p>1. We need a straw man model of the structure of a professional competence
         standard, a model that can be presented to the group for comment. Do
         we have a volunteer or two?</p>
       <p>2. We need to examine and summarize other professional standards, both
         their form and types of issues they include. I am sending a list of some
         standards and codes I know about to each of you. It would be good if
         each of you would pick one of these standards for review, writing a short
         statement about the form of the standard, the types of issues it includes,
         and things that might be especially useful to software engineering.</p>
       <p>There are many standards which I have not listed; feel free to look
         at them and tell us about them.</p>
       <p>3. We can be original. If you have sperm ideas about what should be
         included in a professional competence??s?tandard for professional practice;
         write it up and send it in to the list.</p>
       <p>This is the first step in item A below. I look forward to hearing from
         you.</p>
       <p>Don gotterbarn</p>
       <p>February 16, 1995</p>
       <p>Dear SEEPP Volunteer:</p>
       <p>I thank you for your interest in this important effort of the joint
         IEEE?CS/ACM Steering committee and the working group of professional
         competence. The work of our task force has been slow to start due to
         some of our unfamiliarity with this process. I do sincerely apologize
         for the delay in getting this working group started.</p>
       <p>I hope you continue to be interested in this important effort. We are
         all volunteers in this effort and there was some delay in determining
         how we should proceed. As you know, the IEEE-CS/ACM joint steering committee
         on establishing software engineering as a profession divided the work
         into three major task forces: one defining the current minimal skill
         set required to be a software engineer, another defining how to educate
         people with these skills and keep them current in new and developing
         technologies. These two task forces are well underway. The third task
         force is on software engineering ethics and professional practices(SEEPP).
         The goals of the third task force are to establish standards of professional
         practice for applying these skills and to determine and model minimal
         levels of ethical commitment in the utilization of these skills.</p>
       <p>The task of developing professional practices and standards is new to
         most of us. The SEEPP task force has divided our task up into several
         sub?tasks each of which is assigned to a working group. ( A good computer
         problem solving technique.) A problem that has caused some of the delay
         is the question of how to manage and organize the working group process.
         I have a plan.</p>
       <p>I would like our working group to proceed initially in the following
         way. We do know that other organizations and professions have developed
         standards of practice. These standards vary in numerous ways. Some standards
         of practice are codified and become black letter law for anyone who is
         practicing a profession, while other standards of practice are primarily
         guidelines that help one to make decisions in difficult situations. I
         believe that our standards of practice should probably be a combination
         of both; providing some solid unequivocal minimal standards of practice
         and also provide some guidelines and principles for resolving ethical
         issues that arise in the practice of the profession. Thess guidelines
         are needed to help address new or unanticipated situations created by
         our changing technology and evolving environments.</p>
       <p>In determining how to proceed, there are formal procedural guidelines
         used by the IEEE for the functioning of working groups. I have appended
         a preliminary draft of a version of those guidelines which we are modifying
         for the SEEP task force. Although these address several logistical matters,
         they do not provide a technique for approaching the process. I would
         like to initiate the work of this group in the following way.</p>
       <p>First, I have set up an small email list for the members of the professional
         competence working group at East Tennessee StateProfComp @ ETSU.east?tenn?st.edu.
         Our group can use this list to circulate all correspondence to each member
         of the group. I will put together a list of the current members and I
         will circulate it to all members of the group two weeks after this letter
         has been sent. If you do not want you name circulated on this list please
         contact me before March 5. The names on this list will not be circulated
         to any other organization nor will it be made available by me to any
         other group Anything mailed to the list will only be circulated to members
         of the working group. The list will be moderated by me to eliminate spamming
         and other irrelevant activities. .</p>
       <p>Second, I propose the following general outline for the development
         of our standards in professional competence.</p>
       <p>A. We need to determine the content and structure for our document.
         Some general standards are contained in the appended procedures. But
         we need to be more specific. To this end we need to gather and distribute
         other profession's standards of practice. These need to be distributed
         to and digested by each of us. INFORMATION GATHERING: Please send to
         the LIST: </p>
       <p>1. names and addresses of organizations that you know have standards
         of professional practices.</p>
       <p>2. your willingness to get copies of these standard (preferably electronic)
         for the list.</p>
       <p>3. your willingness to write a short abstract of that standard, indicating
         the scope of application of the standard, means they use to update it,
         how practitioners are educated about that standard, and the methods of
         standards enforcement, if any.<br>
       </p>
       <p>ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS:<br>
   Given this information we should be able to abstract a model of<br>
   professional practices for our use. We can also use these documents, along
   with our knowledge of the nature of the software engineering profession to
   formulate a statement of scope ( i.e., what it is we think we should be doing)
   and a structure in which to organize our suggestions and conclusions. A Scope
   addresses the kinds of things we want to include in our standards and it clearly
   states who is (are) the intended audience(s) for the standard (practitioners,
   educators, professional society officials...)</p>
       <p>B. Once the model is clearly stated we can further subdivide the</p>
       <p>problem based on the model and ask for volunteers to write<br>
   rough first drafts of various sections of the document. These<br>
   first drafts can then be circulated and modified, deleted from,<br>
   added to, altered, etc. The procedure I have in mind is that all<br>
   drafts, documents, suggestions for items to include or exclude<br>
   will be circulated to the entire working group (an electronic<br>
   meeting)</p>
       <p>C. We can then revisit questions of format and content and develop a
         single consistent document which we can present the SEEPP task force.</p>
       <p>D. For the present our meetings will merely be electronic. As we</p>
       <p>progress, there are some national meeting that several of us<br>
   will be at and we can gather in subgroups at those meetings.<br>
   If it is the consensus of the group that we need to all discuss<br>
   something together we can arrange a conference call. (These are<br>
   hard to organize and expensive, so they should be minimized.)</p>
       <p>This procedure is written in Jello. Any suggestions on this process
         will be gratefully accepted. Please send an email 'Hi' to me at ProfComp,
         so that I know this message was received and that the list is working.</p>
       <p>We are underway ! Please refer to item A. above.</p>
       <p>Hoping for a productive relationship and grateful for your interest,</p>
