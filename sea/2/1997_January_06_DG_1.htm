      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" -->Michael, 
       <p> Here is the letter. All this stuff at the top of the document below 
         says- I had to send the message from England to ETSU to use the account 
         that allowed me to send messages to the List server at the University 
         of Tennessee Knoxville and then have the University of Tennessee send 
         things to the list (( an aside- since we are still in business as a task 
         force , it would probably be better if you do not mention the list's specific 
         address in your paper.)</p>
       <p>In the attached letter, Felipe is the IEEE-CS chair of the Steering Committee 
         and Dennis is the ACM chair of the committee. The plan they refer to was 
         sent from England in January or early February (you should have a copy--it 
         is with those three large pacakges I sent) which has specific dates for 
         deliverables from the task force to the Steering Committee and from the 
         Steering Committee to the task force. You can use this plan and copies 
         of material you have to see how the Task Force met its deliverable dates.</p>
       <p>The technical confusion- someone else graciously let us use their list 
         server. As E-mail addresses change- your identity changes (a Humean Problem:-) 
         ) and you get denied access to a list. As my E-mail address changes, I 
         too get denied access. Since I am the guy empowered to change E-mail addresses 
         on the list and my identity has changed, I need to E-mail the systems 
         managers at the University of Tennessee to change things. The saga continues 
         .. I went on leave - Summer &amp; Fall 1996 I was at George Washington 
         University- it took two months before they had me on E-mail so I was using 
         a commercial E-mail address for a while- need to notify Univ of Tennessee. 
         The changed it to George Washington University address. I have to recover 
         the date, but it was shortly thereafter that Felipe and Dennis sent the 
         letter below. I then went off to Leicester England on January 3rd. Three 
         days later I was on E-mail in England sending the letter below. </p>
       <p>The current state of affairs, as best I understand it, is that comments 
         on version 3.0 are arriving via fax, mail, and E-mail. The SEEPP executive 
         committee is going to meet (face to face, in the same city) on December 
         4-6 to organize a response to the comments and a possible revision of 
         the Code. This will be circulated to the task force and after one more 
         go round the Code will be sent to the Steering Committee as a finished 
         product. </p>
       <p>Hope this helps give you more of the picture.</p>
       <p>Cheers,</p>
       <p> don</p>
       <p>ps. Will send copy of your paper with minor grammar and reference cements.</p>
       <p>Pps. Since you are a working member of the task force this is just a 
         resend of information that was available to you.</p>

       <p>From: Donald Gotterbarn &lt;dgot@dmu.ac.uk&gt; Subject: Forwarded mail....</p>
       <p> To: Multiple recipients of list PRFCMP-L &lt;PRFCMP-L@UTKVM1.UTK.EDU&gt; 
         Status: RO X-Status: </p>
       <p>Greetings, There have been some changes in the SEEPP task force you should 
         be made aware of. I have been asked to direct and re-organize the efforts 
         of our task force.( see attached memo) There are several items assigned 
         to us by the ACM/IEEE-CS Steering Committee which have a short deadline. 
         In order to address these tasks I have formed a combined working group 
         collected under a single E-mail list called prfcmp-l. This explains why 
         several of you have received E-mail saying you were added to this list. 
         Please let me know if there are others who should be added to the list. 
         Tomorrow I will send you a copy of the plan, I sent to the Steering Committee 
         along with the draft code of ethics. I hope to have a draft statement 
         of the roles and functions of professional codes of ethics to you all 
         by Thursday. I am now working at The Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility, 
         DeMontfort University and can be reached at dgot@dmu.ac.uk.</p>
       <p>To correspond with the entire group simply send mail to prfcmp-l@utkvm1.utk.edu 
         or just reply to this note. Do not send<br>
         individual mail to this list address.</p>
       <p>More tomorrow .</p>
       <p>regards,</p>

         &gt; Task Force Chairs<br>
         &gt; Ex-Officio Members of Steering Committee<br>

         &gt; Subject: Activities of Task Force on Ethics and Code of Professional<br>
         Conduct<br>
         &gt;<br>
         &gt; In order to expedite the remaining activities assigned to this task 
         force,<br>
         &gt; we have asked Don Gotterbarn to assume full chairmanship. The task<br>
         &gt; force has the following activities to complete by February 14:<br>
         &gt; - complete a draft code of ethics and professional conduct that<br>
         &gt; has its roots in the codes currently in use by other engineering<br>
         &gt; professions as well as the codes of the IEEE and the ACM<br>
         &gt; - document the architecture of this code so that reviewers can<br>
         understand<br>
         &gt; the components, which parts are derived directly from other codes,<br>
         and<br>
         &gt; which parts are specific to software engineering<br>
         &gt; - document the rationale for the new parts of the code (those not<br>
         &gt; derived directly from existing codes or which depart from existing<br>
         &gt; codes in substantive ways)<br>
         &gt;<br>
         &gt; Other activities for the remainder of the year will be outlined in 
         a<br>
         &gt; plan that Don will distribute next week.<br>
         &gt;<br>
         &gt; We understand that for a variety of good reasons, many members of 
         this<br>
         &gt; task force have been unable to participate at the level originally<br>
         planned.<br>
         &gt; We specifically authorize Don to drive the task force to completion,<br>
         &gt; making whatever changes in membership or structure are deemed<br>
         &gt; necessary to accomplish this task.<br>
         &gt;<br>
