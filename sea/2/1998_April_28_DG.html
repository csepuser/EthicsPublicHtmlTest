                   <p align="justify">April 28, 1998</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Dear President House:</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">I respectfully request that the Software 
 
                     Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice (version 
 
                     4) be considered at the next Executive Council meeting in 
 
                     May for adoption by the ACM. We recommend this action for 
 
                     the following reasons:</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Support by both the ACM and the IEEE-CS 
 
                     will be a public assertion by the profession of a unified 
 
                     commitment to ethical responsibility,</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> The Code represents an international standard 
 
                     of practice, </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The Code has been reviewed and adopted by 
 
                     industry,</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> The Code presents a broad consensus of the 
 
                     profession, and</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> There is wide demonstrated positive support, 
 
                     including from academia, industry, and the military for the 
 
                     Code.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">We worked on the Software Engineering Code 
 
                     of Ethics and Professional Practice for almost two years, 
 
                     basing it on other computing and engineering codes and elements 
 
                     unique to the practice of software engineering . It was a 
 
                     broad based development effort--truly international in participation 
 
                     -- with contributions from a wide range of practitioners.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The successive versions of the Code went 
 
                     through a number of significant reviews--both formal and informal. 
 
                     Version 3 was published with a turn around ballot in both 
 
                     the Communications of the ACM and Computer. Most items had 
 
                     at least a 95% approval rating with many at 100 %. The code 
 
                     was also reviewed by ethics officers of various multi-nationals--Lockheed 
 
                     Martin, DEC, Northrop Gruman, etc. It was also reviewed by 
 
                     other professional computer organizations, such as the Australian 
 
                     Computer Society, the British Computer Society, and IFIP. 
 
                     The review process spread beyond our initial plans--companies 
 
                     like TI and Hitachi asked and received permission to put it 
 
                     on their company bulletin boards for review and comment by 
 
                     their employees. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Version 4 took all of these comments into 
 
                     account. There were primarily three kinds of changes. We cleared 
 
                     up clauses that caused some misunderstanding. We also made 
 
                     some structural changes. The most important change was the 
 
                     removal of several imperatives which requested that software 
 
                     engineers do things which were really beyond their control. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The evidence from many outside sources is 
 
                     that we are very close to the mark. Several companies-- including 
 
                     IT shops and software engineering shops-- have recommended 
 
                     the Code as a standard of conduct; it has been posted as an 
 
                     example code of conduct by the Business </p>
 
                   <p align="justify"></p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Software Alliance. The Texas Board of Professional 
 
                     Engineering, Licensing Committee is considering the Code for 
 
                     their proposed licensing standard for Software Engineers. 
 
                     I just heard recently that the Code was used in a program 
 
                     in Australia for industrialists. It is also being used at 
 
                     Fort Monmouth in training materials for computer engineers, 
 
                     computer scientists, and computer specialists. It has already 
 
                     been published several places and discussed at professional 
 
                     meetings, such as the recent Conference on Software Engineering 
 
                     Education and Training in Atlanta and the ACM Policy Conference 
 
                     in Washington.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">This Code complements the more general codes 
 
                     of ethics of both societies which address the issues of the 
 
                     computing profession as a whole. The Code of Software Engineering 
 
                     Ethics and Professional Practice addresses the ethical issues 
 
                     and standards of conduct which specifically arise within the 
 
                     practice of software engineering. In this sense the code is 
 
                     not a replacement for any existing code.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The approval of this Code by both societies 
 
                     will be a significant forward step for the software engineering 
 
                     profession. The cooperative support given by both societies 
 
                     to the development and approval of this Code underscores the 
 
                     importance of a commitment to ethical practices by the profession 
 
                     and will serve as a model for other developing professions. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">I will be participating in the ACM Policy 
 
                     Conference and will be available to answer any questions from 
 
                     Council.</p>
