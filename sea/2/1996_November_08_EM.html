                   <p>Student 1 . . </p>
                   <p>Part la: General Comments </p>
 
                   <p>I have mixed feelings about using this code of ethics for 
 
                     software engineering. One hand, most of the imperatives seem 
 
                     to be common sense. Yet this could be because my 'common sense'' 
 
                     is derived partially from the code of ethics I subscribe to 
 
                     as a member of the military. For civilians that may not necessarily 
 
                     share these beliefs, the software engineering code of ethics 
 
                     might not be common sense. I feel that our military-code of 
 
                     ethics has helped develop a level of trust that allows members 
 
                     to function at a higher level than an organization that lacks 
 
                     this trust. The software engineering code of ethics might 
 
                     instill a trust amongst software engineers that allows them 
 
                     to perform at this higher level. </p>
 
                   <p>In a detailed examination of the software engineering code 
 
                     of ethics, I noticed several things. First, there seemed to 
 
                     be several instances of reiterating behaviors that are required 
 
                     to be a law abiding citizen in the US. The code of ethics 
 
                     should not attempt to rephrase government laws. Second, many 
 
                     of the imperatives discuss employee/business and client/contractor 
 
                     obligations that do not pertain specifically to software engineering, 
 
                     or even engineering in general. Such imperatives may be part 
 
                     of a code for general employment as a professional, or perhaps 
 
                     employment as an engineer, but they should not be in the code 
 
                     of ethics for software engineering. The discriminator for 
 
                     determining if the imperative should be part of this code 
 
                     of ethics is that it raises the standards of behavior of software 
 
                     engineers above those of the engineering field and professionals 
 
                     in general. In the next few examples, specific imperatives 
 
                     that should be removed or modified are presented. </p>
 
                   <p>Part 1b: Identify no more than three individual imperatives 
 
                     that should not be part of code </p>
 
                   <p>4.04 'Not knowingly use pirated software on equipment of 
 
                     a client or employer in work performed for a client or employer. 
 
                     &quot; Stating this imperative in a code of ethics is similar 
 
                     to including a clause ' the software engineer must not knowingly 
 
                     violate any federal laws in the use of . . . ' Such an imperative 
 
                     is unnecessary in a code of ethics. </p>
 
                   <p>5.07 &quot;Only accept a salary appropriate to professional 
 
                     qualifications.'' This imperative is flawed for two reasons. 
 
                     First, there are no written regulations that relate a salary 
 
                     to professional qualifications. Each organization determines 
 
                     salaries based on a number of factors, only one of which involves 
 
                     the current rate for hiring an engineer with given qualifications. 
 
                     In many cases, the other factors outweigh the qualification 
 
                     factor. Second, the word 11only&quot; implies that the engineer 
 
                     should not accept a fob that pays too much for their qualifications, 
 
                     (em nor should the engineer accept a job that pays too little. 
 
                     Yet the engineer must make this decision based not only on 
 
                     what the qualifications are, but also on personal need: If 
 
                     a software engineer (em needs a job to earn a living, that 
 
                     person should be able to accept the job even if it pays too 
 
                     little. </p>
 
                   <p>Likewise, that engineer should not be forced to turn down 
 
                     a job just because it pays too much. </p>
 
                   <p>5.10 'Obey all laws governing their work, insofar as such 
 
                     obedience is consistent with the public heath, safety and 
 
                     welfare''. Several problems exist with this imperative. First, 
 
                     I believe the word &quot;laws &quot; should be changed to 
 
                     &quot;rules&quot; or 'regulations''. We are not referring 
 
                     to government laws here - we are referring to the rules and 
 
                     regulations of the organization where the engineer works. 
 
                     Second, it should be common sense that engineers, and professionals 
 
                     in general would not allow rules and regulations to supersede 
 
                     the need for public health, safety and welfare. These needs 
 
                     are generally protected by government laws, and government 
 
                     laws do not need to be restated in a code of ethics. </p>
 
                   <p>Part 2: Identify no more than six of the individual imperatives 
 
                     that are aspirational </p>
 
                   <p>3.01 &quot;Maintain professional skepticism with respect 
 
                     to any software or related documents they are asked to evaluate.'' 
 
                     Skepticism cannot be measured. In addition, this imperative 
 
                     implies that the software engineer should be prejudiced, albeit 
 
                     professionally, against work they are asked to evaluate. Perhaps 
 
                     objectivity' should replace the word ''skepticism''. The idea 
 
                     we want to convey is that they engineer examines the software 
 
                     or documents in depth and in an unbiased way, not in a 'this 
 
                     is wrong until you show me otherwise'' frame of mind. This 
 
                     imperative, even if reworded, is intrinsically aspirational. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>5.02 'Assure that clients, employers, and supervisors know 
 
                     of this code of ethics''. This imperative cannot be measured 
 
                     on an individual basis. There is no way of measuring how well 
 
                     an individual assured the knowledge of the code to the other 
 
                     people. The action &quot; assure'' does not need to be performed 
 
                     actively to be effective. The organization could however, 
 
                     measure how many people knew about the code. In this case, 
 
                     it would be the responsibility of a particular group of individuals 
 
                     to assure the awareness of the ethics. The effectiveness of 
 
                     that individual or group could then be measured by polling 
 
                     the target population of the organization. This imperative 
 
                     should be removed form the code of ethics and relocated in 
 
                     the &quot; operating instructions&quot; for the group of people 
 
                     performing it. (Note: This imperative is similar to the statement 
 
                     -ensure the occupants of the aircraft know the proper escape 
 
                     procedures&quot; - it must be performed by the staff of the 
 
                     aircraft, not by each passenger.) </p>
 
                   <p>5.03 and 5.09 also cannot be measured. The problem is caused 
 
                     by the verbs -Support&quot; and -Help&quot;. Support cannot 
 
                     be measured in any meaningful units, and neither can help. 
 
                     These are truly aspirational imperatives, but unlike 5.02, 
 
                     they should be performed by individuals. Therefore they should 
 
                     remain in the code of ethics as aspirational tenets. </p>
 
                   <p>5.12 &quot;Improve public knowledge of software engineering.&quot; 
 
                     It would not be feasible to measure the effect of an individual's 
 
                     contribution on the improvement of the-public's knowledge&quot; 
 
                     of software engineering. This imperative is also aspirational 
 
                     in nature, and it cannot be rephrased in a way that would 
 
                     make it quantitatively measurable. </p>

                   <p>1. Critical Evaluation </p>
 
                   <p>a. General Comments about this Code </p>
 
                   <p>Generally, this code is a good start in defining the bounds 
 
                     of our blossoming profession. The seven rules with their associated 
 
                     imperatives address the various areas where our profession's 
 
                     ethics come into play. I certainly believe there is room to 
 
                     expand this list, but I would hope that expansion will happen 
 
                     with maturity. The important point here is that an essential 
 
                     step has been taken that serve as a foundation for strong 
 
                     ethical standards in software engineering. This foundation 
 
                     can do nothing but improve the profession as a whole. </p>
 
                   <p>b. 3 Imperatives to Remove </p>
 
                   <p>- 1.12. is far too broad in scope to be considered a imperative 
 
                     in this list. I believe each imperative under every broadly 
 
                     defined rule should define individual important areas of that 
 
                     rule. The imperative 1.12. can be broken down into potentially 
 
                     5 imperatives that further define the scope. For example, 
 
                     one imperative can discuss the importance of identifying, 
 
                     defining, and addressing environmental issue with more specifics 
 
                     on what kinds of general environmental issues are involved. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>- 5.02 is perhaps a bit overkill. We should strive to advertise 
 
                     our ethics aggressively internal to our profession. However, 
 
                     following an imperative that requires us to explain our code 
 
                     of ethics to all clients, employers, and supervisors could 
 
                     be very difficult to achieve and, T believe, largely ignored. 
 
                     This imperative could be &quot;watered down&quot; a bit by 
 
                     encouraging external advertisement of our ethics or externally 
 
                     advertising only that we have a code of ethics. </p>
 
                   <p>- 5.11. is far too vague to be an imperative. Its unclear 
 
                     if this imperative is encouraging software engineers to participate 
 
                     in civic affairs or to serve constructively when participating 
 
                     in civic affairs. Also, this imperative doesn't indicate which 
 
                     civic affairs a software engineer should be serving in. Finally, 
 
                     I question if this imperative is supposed to be under Self 
 
                     rather than Professional if it should be imperative at all. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>c. Importance of Ethics for Groups </p>
 
                   <p>Of course ethics is needed in groups, particularly groups 
 
                     that have such a drastic effect on people lives like software 
 
                     engineers. The most important reason is trust. If the public 
 
                     knows a group has and practices good ethics, the public will 
 
                     tend to trust that group more. This can clearly be seen in 
 
                     the profession of politics in the last 30 years. Flagrant 
 
                     violations of laws and basic ethics, from Watergate to Iran-Contra, 
 
                     had steadily eroded public trust for our political leaders. 
 
                     We can learn from these mistakes to build trust with our profession 
 
                     and avoid the pitfalls that come from a lack of ethics. </p>
 
                   <p>2. Aspirational Imperatives </p>
 
                   <p>- 1.10. is a vital imperative but is a very difficult imperative 
 
                     to measure. The law might be one place to determine whether 
 
                     or not privacy is being violated, but privacy issues have 
 
                     been a real legal battleground lately. I really believe this 
 
                     aspirational imperative should remain aspirational, allowing 
 
                     it to survive as privacy issues change and mature. </p>
 
                   <p>- 9.01. brings up the question, &quot;What is competence?&quot; 
 
                     I may feel as a trained software engineer that I have the 
 
                     competence to take on real time system project even though 
 
                     I've never worked on a real time system. Competence seems 
 
                     to be a term open to interpretation, making it difficult to 
 
                     measure. I suggest eliminating this imperative and letting 
 
                     the imperatives under Self and Profession carry the meaning 
 
                     embodied in this imperative. </p>
 
                   <p>- 3.01. is like 9.01 in that skepticism is a term open to 
 
                     individual interpretation. This can be changed to read, &quot;Provide 
 
                     honest, critical evaluations of software and related documents.&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>- 5.01. is another hard to measure term open to interpretation. 
 
                     An improper use of this ethic can in itself be unethical. 
 
                     For example, if you deem a company unreputable and deny that 
 
                     company your business on a gut feel rather than hard evidence. 
 
                     You could alter this imperative to focus on businesses who 
 
                     have been convicted of illegal practices. </p>
 
                   <p>- 5.03. should read the other direction, &quot;Don't support 
 
                     SE's who are found in violation of this code.&quot; The number 
 
                     of SE's who are convicted of violating the code are more easily 
 
                     measurable and easier to identify. </p>
 
                   <p>- 6.13. again brings up the problem of interpretation. What 
 
                     one person thinks is fair and just compensation doesn't necessarily 
 
                     hold true for another. This is another imperative that I thinks 
 
                     should remain aspirational in the code. It may be difficult 
 
                     to measure, but its always a good value to shoot for. </p>
 
                   <p>------------------------------------------------------------------

                   <p>Student 3 </p>
 
                   <p>a. General Comments </p>
 
                   <p>I think the intent of the code is good. But I strongly disagree 
 
                     with any attempt to &quot;legislate&quot; what is really common 
 
                     sense. Thus, I feel the SW/E &quot; code&quot; should be less 
 
                     detailed, more like the 10 Commandments. Or, perhaps a more 
 
                     appropriate example, the Hippocratic Oath. I have attached 
 
                     a hard copy of a web page that provides a contemporary review 
 
                     of the Oath, and several humors secular variations. My point 
 
                     is, in the various oaths used by the medical community, roughly 
 
                     5 to 10 statements are sufficient to &quot; guide'' the profession. 
 
                     Frankly, for the software professional, I would be happy to 
 
                     see just the seven rules in the current draft be the &quot;Ethics 
 
                     of the Software Professional&quot; . </p>
 
                   <p>b. Definite Don't Includes </p>
 
                   <p>Definitely, 1.19 should be eliminated. By saying that someone 
 
                     should depart from standards practices only when justified&quot; 
 
                     is a hunting license to depart from standard anytime you can 
 
                     justify it. Sounds like an Ada waiver. </p>
 
                   <p>Another is 1.03. One, let's be honest, while we would like 
 
                     to think that education alone is sufficient to qualify someone, 
 
                     reality is, without experience, the individual is still ill 
 
                     prepared. So, how does one become experienced if they can't 
 
                     practice without being experienced? Perhaps reword the clause 
 
                     to read ' ... for which they are responsible''.</p>
 
                   <p>My third candidate is 6.11. -Not supplant another software 
 
                     engineer after steps have been taken for employment.'' What 
 
                     in the world does this mean? I looked up supplant, it says 
 
                     - to be replaced by another&quot; . Ok, this still doesn't 
 
                     make sense. </p>
 
                   <p>c. My &quot;Lieutenant &quot; Feelings on &quot;A Code of 
 
                     Ethics'' </p>
 
                   <p>My personal view on this issue is biased because I&#8217;m 
 
                     a member of the Armed Forces. We operate under this little 
 
                     thing called the UCMJ; very Enforceable then shahs and the, 
 
                     shall net,. Interestingly enough, it is my opinion that the 
 
                     &quot;rigid&quot; military environment actually gives us more 
 
                     latitude in our endeavors because we know the rules. In the 
 
                     private sector, there are just as many limits on one's conduct, 
 
                     however, most of them are implied. Of course I'm speaking 
 
                     in general terms, not specifically with regards to software 
 
                     activities. Reinforcing my position from part (bf a using 
 
                     the military example, our Oath is just a short paragraph, 
 
                     but it total defines what we are and how we are to do it! 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>&quot;Aspirational &quot; verses ' ., embodied in a code 
 
                     of practice.'' </p>
 
                   <p>Here I'm going to use your own words, not against you necessarily, 
 
                     but to further emphasize my theme. 7 believe what this committee 
 
                     has begun is more a enumeration of the practices of the profession 
 
                     of software engineering, i.e. [em code of practices, than 
 
                     a statement of what is hem ethical (right verses wrong) with 
 
                     respect to software engineering. If its ethics we are defining, 
 
                     then indeed, they should be aspirational. Again, I propose 
 
                     the seven rules (sounds like Covey) as the [em Code of Ethics 
 
                     to provide the vision and direction to the profession. Under 
 
                     that I would put the other subsidiary clauses as hem Examples 
 
                     of practices. Even the Introduction states 11 no set of subsidiary 
 
                     clauses exhaust the general rule.&quot; So since there is 
 
                     no complete code of practices, why try to legislate it. </p>
 
                   <p>Since flexibility is the key to Airpower, I've answered this 
 
                     section in my own way rather than providing six examples. 
 
                     I'm sure there are enough sensates (Myers-Briggs Type Indicators) 
 
                     in the class to provide you with a laundry list. </p>

                   <p>Student 4 </p>
 
                   <p>1. Critical Evaluation of Software Engineering Code of Ethics 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>General Comments on IEEE/ACM Code: To be a profession, an 
 
                     occupation has to have some attributes which discriminate 
 
                     ii from non-professions. A code of ethics would go a long 
 
                     way towards discriminating Software Engineering from software 
 
                     hacking. </p>
 
                   <p>Since I personally have no experience with other engineering 
 
                     professions' codes of ethics, I have nothing to compare this 
 
                     code to. I feel, however, that much of what is here is a &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot; 
 
                     mix of common sense and &quot;motherhood&quot; style aphorisms. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Overall, I'd structure the code into two sections: Imperatives 
 
                     that are testable, and thus measurable and enforceable; Imperatives 
 
                     that are worthy goals. </p>
 
                   <p>Remove these imperatives: (most others are useful things 
 
                     we should strive to do, be.) </p>
 
                   <p>1.19 Avoid Fads, Stick with Standard Practices: What's a 
 
                     Fad? Should we have avoided the entire 00 &quot;fad&quot;? 
 
                     Should we have eschewed the Client/Server movement? It seems 
 
                     to me this imperative would only stifle creativity and innovation. 
 
                     Besides, what are the standard practices? This field has evolved 
 
                     faster than any other--Standard Practices of today could be 
 
                     outdated and inefficient in two years. </p>
 
                   <p>9.01 Provide Service only in areas of competence. First, 
 
                     how do you know if you're competent? By taking the standardized 
 
                     test?(HA). </p>
 
                   <p>Second, if you only work in areas you are competent in, then 
 
                     how can you ever hope to get a job doing something else, and 
 
                     how did you achieve competence in the first place? Award of 
 
                     a Bachelors or Masters degree is conference that you understand 
 
                     certain ideas and material--it does not mean that you're competent 
 
                     (hence the separate test to be a P.E.). Once again, since 
 
                     software is generally not based upon principles of the physical 
 
                     world, I submit that it would be nearly impossible to create 
 
                     a decent test of competency. </p>
 
                   <p>5.05 Report violations of this code to appropriate authorities. 
 
                     &quot;I'd like to report that Joseph Blough does not understand 
 
                     fully the specifications for the software he is working on.&quot; 
 
                     Silence, followed by laughter on the other side of the phone 
 
                     line. This imperative should be removed completely, or .. 
 
                     1) restructure the code of ethics into testable and aspirational 
 
                     parts 2) make 5.05 apply only to the testable parts of the 
 
                     code. </p>
 
                   <p>Comments on applying a code to a group of individuals Since 
 
                     most of these imperatives are aspirational (see below), rather 
 
                     than strictly testable, there really isn't a problem applying 
 
                     this code to a group of people. </p>
 
                   <p>Oh the other hand, if everything was strictly &quot;testable&quot;, 
 
                     then applying the code would also incur enforcing the code, 
 
                     which means there would be punishment of the guilty, and a 
 
                     consistent means of determining who's guilty and who's innocent. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Now, we must ask ourselves the question, &quot;Could an American 
 
                     Software Engineer follow this code without being ostracized 
 
                     from the dirty, no-holds-barred, cutthroat, dog-eat-dog world 
 
                     of American Business?&quot; I don't think so; Clark Kent gets 
 
                     by with his forthright attitude because he has magic powers 
 
                     the rest of us mortals don't have. I'm not saying that we 
 
                     shouldn't have a code of ethics, I'm just saying we can't 
 
                     expect everyone to follow it. I'm not going to tell my customer 
 
                     his project is going to turn out badly (assuming my management 
 
                     won't do it) when it's going to take food out of my children's 
 
                     mouths. (I might start looking for another Dab with a reputable 
 
                     company though). </p>
 
                   <p>2. Aspirational Imperatives </p>
 
                   <p>It seems to me that almost all of these imperatives are aspirational, 
 
                     except for the ones that can be verified In a binary manner, 
 
                     e.g., you either accept or reject a bribe. That doesn't mean 
 
                     that they're not important--it just means that these imperatives 
 
                     reflect the truth about our fuzzy, gray world (that is, ahem, 
 
                     that it is a fuzzy, gray world).. </p>
 
                   <p>Here then are some aspirational imperatives and what to do 
 
                     with them. </p>
 
                   <p>1.01. Assure specs are good... <br>
 
                     HA, this is the &quot;holy grail&quot; of software engineering. 
 
                     If we could Assure specs were good in the first place, then 
 
                     we wouldn't have to wrestle with many of the problems of quality, 
 
                     timeliness, and cost that we have. </p>
 
                   <p>What to do? Nothing! Recognize this aspiration for what it 
 
                     is!, an aspiration, a worthy goal. We should all strive to 
 
                     ensure specs are &quot;good&quot;... </p>
 
                   <p>1.02. Assure engineer fully understands the specs...</p>
 
                   <p>This aspirational imperative is nearly the same as 1.01. 
 
                     as above. </p>
 
                   <p>5.07 Only accept a salary appropriate to professional qualifications 
 
                     <br>
 
                     A problem for several reasons. <br>
 
                     1. It's hard to quantify/verify a professionals' qualifications. 
 
                     <br>
 
                     2. What does &quot;appropriate&quot; mean? <br>
 
                     3. It acts as though professional jobs are monolithic (generic 
 
                     software guy), yet there are many kinds of software jobs, 
 
                     each with different pay scales (MIS vs. Embedded Software 
 
                     Engineering vs. Software Test. </p>
 
                   <p>This should be restated as something like... &quot;Don't 
 
                     accept a salary more than 108 lower or 108 higher than the 
 
                     median in that local market for a position with similar responsibilities.&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Student 5 </p>
 
                   <p>In reviewing the software engineering code of ethics, I found 
 
                     it to be an almost stifling document, filled with grandiose 
 
                     ideals of what a software engineer should be. Most of the 
 
                     concepts that it embodies can be applied to any professional 
 
                     group or affiliation with minor changes; what's missing, for 
 
                     the most part, are areas specific to software engineering. 
 
                     I find it hard to believe that such a verbose listing of &quot;imperatives&quot; 
 
                     is necessary; perhaps it's just me, but I find this almost 
 
                     insulting to my sense of propriety, as if the author is questioning 
 
                     my values by listing things which should clearly be innate. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Unrealistic </p>
 
                   <p>1.13: &quot;Promote maximum productivity and minimum cost 
 
                     to employer, customer, user, and public.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>Does this really belong in a code of ethics? If society has 
 
                     regressed to the point where we actually need to codify ideals 
 
                     such as this, then this &quot;code of ethics&quot; would need 
 
                     to be volumes larger. Note that this applies to a great many 
 
                     of the imperatives listed as well; is it really necessary 
 
                     to list that which should be a given? </p>
 
                   <p>5.01: &quot;Associate only with reputable businesses.&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Again we have a question of semantics-what marks a business 
 
                     as &quot;reputable&quot;? In any case, with what businesses 
 
                     a software engineer chooses to work should not be in the purview 
 
                     of a professional organization. </p>
 
                   <p>5.07: &quot;Only accept a salary appropriate to professional 
 
                     qualifications.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>Who decides? By what measure is one's qualifications (and 
 
                     by extension, one's salary) measured? If your employer values 
 
                     your skills that highly, why should you not accept the salary, 
 
                     no matter what level? </p>
 
                   <p>Aspirational </p>
 
                   <p>1.03: &quot;Assure than they are qualified, by education 
 
                     and experience, for any project on which they work&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>I feel that this imperative is a bit limiting; after all, 
 
                     how is a person to grow, to improve, unless they take on such 
 
                     challenges? I agree that projects that are obviously out of 
 
                     reach should be avoided, but if this were to be followed, 
 
                     I doubt that many people at AFIT would be qualified for the 
 
                     thesis they are working on. </p>
 
                   <p>1.07: &quot;Assure proper estimates of cost, schedule, personnel, 
 
                     and outcome on any project on which they work.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>Again, nice but not really attainable. Software development 
 
                     is by nature a rapidly-changing project; to define &quot;proper 
 
                     estimates&quot; ignores the reality of how things need to 
 
                     adapt to an ever-changing situation. </p>
 
                   <p>1.14: &quot;Avoid fads, departing from standard practices 
 
                     only when justified.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>What is the definition of &quot;justified&quot;? I'm sure 
 
                     that when object oriented programming was first envisioned, 
 
                     it was probably considered a fad. There will be times when 
 
                     non-standard practices are optimal in a given situation, but 
 
                     what defines the limits of justification? </p>
 
                   <p>5.03: &quot;Support software engineers who do as this code 
 
                     requires.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>Here we see a disturbing concept: &#8220; as this code requires.&#8221; 
 
                     Does this then mean that we are too shun those who seek their 
 
                     own path? This could probably be better worded along the lines 
 
                     of &quot;Support software engineers who strive to attain the 
 
                     ideals of this code&quot;, but that is pretty reaching itself. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>5.11: &quot;Serve In civic affairs constructively.&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Huh? Why should a professional organization concerned with 
 
                     software engineering be interested in how one serves in civic 
 
                     affairs? Granted, members of this organization should strive 
 
                     for impeccable public character, but this is beyond the scope 
 
                     of this document. </p>
 
                   <p>---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Student 6 </p>
 
                   <p>la. I have mixed feelings about this document. On one hand, 
 
                     I believe it presents many good general guidelines to follow. 
 
                     Many of them are common sense, and most, if not all, are things 
 
                     that should be second nature to officers. My big complaint 
 
                     about the code is the lack of emphasis on the need for at 
 
                     least a high level understanding of the environment the software 
 
                     the engineer is working on resides. This environment includes 
 
                     such things as the surrounding hardware pieces, networks and 
 
                     their corresponding interfaces, and other various system level 
 
                     issues. I think this kind of information is critical for software 
 
                     engineers to understand, and I don't see any kind of emphasis 
 
                     on that here. It seems like the software world sometimes has 
 
                     a tendency to stick its head in the sand and focus only on 
 
                     software, ignoring all the outside issues which frequently 
 
                     can doom a project to failure if not sufficiently considered 
 
                     and understood. </p>
 
                   <p>1b. </p>
 
                   <p>Item 1.13: Promote maximum productivity and minimum cost 
 
                     to employer, customer, user, and public. I don't agree with 
 
                     this one because I don't believe the &quot;minimum cost&quot; 
 
                     of doing something is always the best way. It's ok to present 
 
                     that option, but I think too often we end up buying a &quot;cheap&quot; 
 
                     short-term fix, which ends up being very expensive in the 
 
                     long term. </p>
 
                   <p>Item 9.02: Assure that any document upon which they rely 
 
                     has been approved by someone qualified to approve it. While 
 
                     this sounds good, I don't think this item is realistic. It 
 
                     places the responsibility for accuracy/veracity on the engineer, 
 
                     rather than the producer and/or manager of the document. The 
 
                     engineer should definitely use their innate &quot;engineering 
 
                     intuition&quot; filter when reviewing any document they need, 
 
                     but there are many times (from personal experience) when documents 
 
                     I've reviewed look right/sound right, unfortunately they are 
 
                     several revisions old. You do learn after a while which documents 
 
                     to trust and which ones not to, but ultimately your documents 
 
                     are only as good as your document manager is. Nor does a software 
 
                     engineer typically have time to personally validate each document 
 
                     he needs to do his job. </p>
 
                   <p>Item 5.07: Only accept a salary appropriate to professional 
 
                     qualifications. This should be dictated by the market, not 
 
                     by the criteria above. The criteria listed are subjective 
 
                     (good qualifications to one person don't cut it with another) 
 
                     and salaries vary widely by region and industry. </p>
 
                   <p>lc. As already alluded to in section la, I believe most of 
 
                     this (particularly the portion emphasizing ethics) should 
 
                     be second nature to officers. Given the current state of ethics 
 
                     in the civilian community, I believe this code could be quite 
 
                     eye-opening. </p>
 
                   <p>2. a. Item 1.01: Assure that specifications for software 
 
                     on which they work have been put in writing, satisfy the user's 
 
                     requirements, and have the customer's approval. I believe 
 
                     this item is not realistic. I think this is a laudable goal, 
 
                     and in some cases I think this can be done, but in all lobs 
 
                     I have held, the requirements are fluid. In the satellite 
 
                     operations world, requirements change because the operational 
 
                     environment changes (satellites fail or degrade, orbits change, 
 
                     new satellites are launched, special missions are required, 
 
                     etc.). I think this item should start with a &quot;When possible 
 
                     ...... . </p>
 
                   <p>b. Item 1.08: Assure adequate documentation on any project 
 
                     on which they work, including a log of problems discovered 
 
                     and solutions adopted. Adequate documentation is not just 
 
                     nice to have, it can often be crucial to working a problem. 
 
                     That said, however, the term &quot;adequate documentation&quot; 
 
                     Is nebulous. I believe it would be helpful to have engineers 
 
                     use the processes they have in place. For example, make sure 
 
                     they update programmers notebooks, follow their organizations 
 
                     programming style ( particularly with respect to in-line documentation), 
 
                     make the appropriate manual changes/updates as their process 
 
                     requires, and make sure any problems are reported using the 
 
                     organizations problem reporting procedure. Perhaps this item 
 
                     could emphasizing utilization of their organization's documentation 
 
                     processes. </p>
 
                   <p>c. Item 2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared 
 
                     under their supervision and within their areas of competence. 
 
                     While this is a laudable goal, many times it is impossible 
 
                     to do, particularly for an Air Force officer. Speaking from 
 
                     personal experience, if I waited to sign off on a document 
 
                     before I understand every nuance, I wouldn't have signed many 
 
                     documents. I believe its important for an engineer in charge 
 
                     of a large project to find people in whose expertise they 
 
                     trust when the project expands beyond their area of competence. 
 
                     At minimum, this item needs a &quot;Whenever possible, ... 
 
                     . As with many of these items, a little common sense (and 
 
                     sound engineering intuition) goes a long way. </p>
 
                   <p>d. Item 9.01. Provide service only in area of competence. 
 
                     This is certainly desirable, but many times its not possible. 
 
                     Many times, software engineers are forced to work in areas 
 
                     right on the edge (or even outside) their areas of expertise. 
 
                     This item would be better if it said &quot;Whenever avoidable, 
 
                     do not provide service outside your area of competence.&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>e. Item 5.01. Associate only with reputable businesses. While 
 
                     I don't disagree with the spirit of this item, some problems 
 
                     can occur if strictly followed. Occasionally, you will find 
 
                     that a parent company may be considered rather suspect, while 
 
                     the local division of the same company upholds high standards. 
 
                     The opposite can occur as well. I've been in situations as 
 
                     well where the worker bees of the company did a fine job, 
 
                     but unfortunately, the company management folks weren't exactly 
 
                     honest w/the Air Force, thereby causing lots of problems. 
 
                     Finally, we (as officers) are often placed in situations where 
 
                     we must work with a disreputable contractor due to contractual 
 
                     obligations-- in this case we must make the best of a bad 
 
                     situation. </p>
 
                   <p>f. Item 5.11. Serve in civic affairs constructively. This 
 
                     item is too vague. If the intent is to present a positive 
 
                     public of software engineers to the public, then some suggestions 
 
                     should be included in the item. Some examples could be high 
 
                     school outreach programs letting students know what kind of 
 
                     opportunities software engineering has to offer, serving as 
 
                     Judges in science fairs, etc. </p>

                   <p>Student 7 </p>
 
                   <p>1. General Comments </p>
 
                   <p>In general, I found the Code of Ethics for Software Engineers 
 
                     to be a good document. It expresses the need for ethics and 
 
                     addresses the areas where ethical behavior must be applied. 
 
                     I do disagree with the level of detail of some of the imperatives. 
 
                     Rather than pertain to ethical practices, some imperatives 
 
                     seem to delve into job performance. For example, Rule 5 is 
 
                     a good statement that I interpret to mean that software engineers 
 
                     should act with integrity and good conduct. Specifically, 
 
                     imperative 5.13 discusses the need to share lob knowledge 
 
                     with other professionals in a variety of forums. I do not 
 
                     think my participation in conferences or publication of articles 
 
                     is an ethical issue. If the intent is to say that I should 
 
                     not keep secrets about new discoveries in the area, it is 
 
                     justified; but the way it reads someone could interpret it 
 
                     to mean that they must participate in every possible forum 
 
                     to be ethical. I do not think the later is an ethical issue, 
 
                     but one of professional choice. </p>
 
                   <p>2. Imperatives that should not be part of this code </p>
 
                   <p>1.14 Avoid fads, departing from standard practices only when 
 
                     justified. </p>
 
                   <p>I do not see the connection between fads and non-ethical 
 
                     behavior. Sometimes, good ideas start out as fads and are 
 
                     rejected by the establishment at first. Only after proven 
 
                     use by those bold enough to go against the establishment are 
 
                     these accepted. This imperative seems to quell some latitude 
 
                     for creativity which is greatly needed as this infant discipline 
 
                     searches to define a majority of its aspects. Amore ethical 
 
                     statement could be to not institute new or faddish practices 
 
                     without first discussing them with an employer or client. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>4.01 Provide service only in areas of competence </p>
 
                   <p>With the amount of downsizing, I am sure most Air Force officers 
 
                     as well as employees of civilian corporations have had to 
 
                     accept responsibilities that are somewhat out of their area 
 
                     of expertise and competence. However, as professionals, we 
 
                     have the responsibility to do our best job and learn as much 
 
                     as we can to perform the new job.</p>
 
                   <p>This imperative seems to say, unless you already have the 
 
                     knowledge, do not take on anything new. This could stunt the 
 
                     professional growth of software engineers. I think a better 
 
                     statement may be to appraise an employer or client of areas 
 
                     which are new or beyond your experience to date and let them 
 
                     make the decision if they want you to pursue it or not. </p>
 
                   <p>5.12 Improve public knowledge of software engineering </p>
 
                   <p>Although important to furthering the discipline and encouraging 
 
                     young professionals to enter, this imperative has no pertinence 
 
                     to ethics. If I do not speak publicly about the merits of 
 
                     software engineering, have I violated an ethical premise? 
 
                     In my opinion, no. An uninformed public may be resistant to 
 
                     software engineering practices as a result, but I am not acting 
 
                     in an unethical manner. </p>
 
                   <p>3. All six of the imperatives that I feel are aspirations 
 
                     fall under rule 1. They are: 1.02 Assure that they understand 
 
                     fully the specifications for software on which they work </p>
 
                   <p>How do you measure full understanding of the specifications. 
 
                     I can begin work thinking that I fully understand something 
 
                     but maybe about halfway through I realize that my understanding 
 
                     was based on an erroneous assumption. One person may interpret 
 
                     full understanding to be flawless understanding while another 
 
                     may interpret it to be the best understanding possible given 
 
                     the information provided. In either case an individual's understanding 
 
                     is difficult to measure. Reword - Discuss specifications with 
 
                     employer or client to insure both parties are in agreement.

                   <p>1.09 Assure proper goals and objectives for any project on 
 
                     which they work </p>
 
                   <p>Who defines proper? Once again, different people may interpret 
 
                     this in different ways and it makes measurement difficult.

                     on which they work </p>
 
                   <p>Since development methodology is still non-standard in many 
 
                     cases, who determines what is proper and what is not? Reword

                     they work </p>
 
                   <p>Who determines adequate? What is adequate to me may not be 
 
                     adequate to someone else. Another very subjective item. Reword

                     and related documents on which they work </p>
 
                   <p>Once again, the word proper begs the question of who defines 
 
                     what is proper. Reword - Apply justifiable testing, debugging,

                   <p>Student 8 </p>
 
                   <p>General Comments: </p>
 
                   <p>In summary, I am distressed that any organization should 
 
                     be in need of a code of ethics aside from the original Code 
 
                     of Ethics that has been with us all the while. Why is it that 
 
                     we need a separate document to tell us that we should not 
 
                     accept a bribe, or to always do our best? Naturally, the original 
 
                     Code of Ethics I'm speaking about is the Bible. It seems demeaning 
 
                     in some way to have any professional organization espouse 
 
                     a written list of ethics (thereby intoning that there are 
 
                     those who would not hold to those ethics if there were not 
 
                     written down) that I have taken for granted nearly all my 
 
                     life. </p>
 
                   <p>Does this mean then that this particular code is houseful? 
 
                     No, I don't think so. Even as we have found in scripture that 
 
                     well intentioned people go astray, so there is need to write 
 
                     down a list of rules for each of us to obey. Why else did 
 
                     God give the people Israel the Ten Commandments? </p>
 
                   <p>My general contention is that the moral base of our professional 
 
                     society is slipping to the point that we must be reminded 
 
                     that &quot;Thou shall not steal... </p>
 
                   <p>As for the actual wording of this particular code of ethics 
 
                     for software engineers, it seems that a lot of work has been 
 
                     put into it to describe the highest qualities of professionalism 
 
                     that software engineers need to display. </p>
 
                   <p>It should go well in helping to establish software engineering 
 
                     as one of the foundational engineering practices. </p>
 
                   <p>What Should Not Be There: </p>
 
                   <p>3.02. As stated above, I am quit document of this call],,, 
 
                     that would not ASSUME the bribe. </p>
 
                   <p>It just seems to me that these rules could be built with 
 
                     another set of rules in mind. </p>
 
                   <p>Is this realistic? Probably not. I am well aware of our pluralism 
 
                     in this day and age, and that a shrinking majority of people 
 
                     have in mind this same set of ethics \ that I speak. I am 
 
                     just generally bothered that this must be in here. </p>
 
                   <p>Aspirational: </p>
 
                   <p>5.03. It seems that &quot;Support software engineers who 
 
                     do as this code requires.&quot; is a bit aspirational. What 
 
                     does this really mean? What if I disagree with another person 
 
                     professionally? What does it mean to support them as this 
 
                     code requires? How do I measure that? It seems pretty vague.</p>
 
                   <p>------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Student 9 </p>
 
                   <p>1. </p>
 
                   <p>a. In general a code of ethics should be adopted by any group 
 
                     who wishes to maintain an ethical approach to business. In 
 
                     the most general case most ethical decisions seem to be common 
 
                     sense but in the case of someone who was not raised in an 
 
                     ethical manner these rules should probably be spelled out 
 
                     for them. For those people who have been raised ethically 
 
                     this code of ethics could be insulting unless they look at 
 
                     the fact it was written to inform those who have no ethics. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>b.1. 1.10 How can documents interfere with the privacy of 
 
                     those persons reading said manuals. This seems ridiculous 
 
                     to think that a written document can intrude on the privacy 
 
                     of an individual. </p>
 
                   <p>b.2. 3.06 Seems shaky due to the fact that it contradicts 
 
                     the negotiating process of suiting a potential client with 
 
                     the proper software for the job the client is requesting. 
 
                     It almost seems as if a hands-off policy is adopted after 
 
                     a client solicits the company. Essential communication between 
 
                     those working on a project and the buyer of said product should 
 
                     ensue so that those paying for the software get the desired 
 
                     product. </p>
 
                   <p>63. 5.03 This statement in my opinion potentially asks unethical 
 
                     people to support ethical people and it seems limited to only 
 
                     Software Engineers who should be adapting to this code of 
 
                     ethics since it was written specifically for them. In general 
 
                     this statement seems ridiculous. </p>
 
                   <p>c. Hopefully most individuals with a college education have 
 
                     some form of ethics. Unfortunately some schools allow unethical 
 
                     behavior and some of those people without ethics will make 
 
                     it into the professional world. If these ethics are so valuable 
 
                     to the profession they have been written for, These ethics 
 
                     should be able to be enforced and those members not abiding 
 
                     to the ethics set forth in this document should be booted 
 
                     from the profession until they prove in one form or another 
 
                     they have obtained an ethical attitude toward the standards 
 
                     which have been set. </p>
 
                   <p>2. </p>
 
                   <p>a. 9.01 Sometimes people need to learn a job before they 
 
                     can do it. As long as this is understood then a person who 
 
                     is not fully competent in a field may gain work experience 
 
                     in order to get this job done. In other words... not everyone 
 
                     is an expert and training is required. </p>
 
                   <p>b. 5.09 In the world of the government how do you reorganize 
 
                     an organization to be favorable to acting ethically since 
 
                     most organizations are formed in the government to save highly 
 
                     paid officials the rate of pay they are currently earning. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>c. 5.05 Who are the proper authorities? Since there is no 
 
                     certification for software engineers what actions can be taken 
 
                     against people who do not conform to these ethics. </p>
 
                   <p>d. 5.11 This seems like a constitutional violation of the 
 
                     first amendment (right to free speech) People should be able 
 
                     to act &quot;nonconstructively&quot; in civic affairs as long 
 
                     as they protest peacefully. </p>
 
                   <p>e. 6.02 Seems difficult to maintain since sometimes a boss 
 
                     asks for reviews of other peoples work and you may be selected 
 
                     to do that. Thus you will be reviewing other peoples work 
 
                     possibly without their knowledge. </p>
 
                   <p>f. 5.01 This may be hard to identify unless a full search 
 
                     is done by an individual before doing business with a company. 
 
                     Once a contract is signed the contract should be binding. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Student 10 </p>
 
                   <p>1.a. Overall, the code is pretty good. On a scale from 1 
 
                     to 10, 1 would give it a 6 or a 7. I think the 7 rules hit 
 
                     all the main areas of concern for any field. Software Production 
 
                     or something similar as it extends beyond the product to the 
 
                     aspects of making the product and managing the effort to make 
 
                     the product. </p>
 
                   <p>The major negative to the document is the number of &quot;weasel 
 
                     words&quot; used in the imperatives. A &quot;weasel word&quot; 
 
                     is a word meant to give you leeway in interpretation and measurement. 
 
                     Some examples from the code are &quot;proper,&quot; &quot;appropriate,&quot; 
 
                     and &quot;badly.&quot; These type words are not always inappropriate 
 
                     (oops!), but in many cases detract from codifying or making 
 
                     concrete the type of desired behavior. Most of the my selections 
 
                     for part 2 relate to the overuse of &quot;weasel words.&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>1.b. I believe the following imperatives, as written should 
 
                     not be a part of the code: </p>
 
                   <p>1.19 Avoid fads, departing from standard practices only when 
 
                     justified. </p>
 
                   <p>This imperative is well-intentioned, but suffers from two 
 
                     flaws, one of which is fatal. Namely, the identification of 
 
                     fads can never be done with certainty. A good example is using 
 
                     lines of code to measure software size. In a recent presentation 
 
                     at the Dayton Marriott, Capers Jones asserted this is malpractice, 
 
                     yet a large contingent of industry has used, does use, and 
 
                     will use this measure. Is LOC a fad? Or, is it stepping stone 
 
                     to better measures that industry will eventually outgrow? 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>9.09 Represent no interest adverse to their employer's without 
 
                     the employer's consent. Even when couched in the context provided 
 
                     by the parent rule, this imperative is too encompassing. First 
 
                     of all, it assumes the employer and/or client are basically 
 
                     &quot;good&quot; and follow some code of ethics, which in 
 
                     most cases, probably is not true. Also, it seems to prohibit 
 
                     actions such as lob-hunting (without first informing your 
 
                     employer AND getting permission), investing money in a company 
 
                     that in any way competes with your employer, or opposing your 
 
                     employer's business plan for any reason other than those given 
 
                     in Rule2. </p>
 
                   <p>1.13 Promote maximum productivity and minimum cost to employer, 
 
                     customer, user, and public. </p>
 
                   <p>I'm not as hard over on eliminating this one, but I don't 
 
                     think promoting minimum cost to the customer, user, and public 
 
                     should be included. The customer, user, and public have the 
 
                     right to be safe using your product, but have no rights concerning 
 
                     the price they are will to pay for your product. I could live 
 
                     with a weasel wording such as &quot;fair price.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>1.c I feel the definition/use/application of a code of ethics 
 
                     is crucial to creating an occupation such as software engineering. 
 
                     What binds the United States together in a general sense is 
 
                     belief in such ideals as freedom, democracy, and justice. 
 
                     Such ideals are needed to bind professional together into 
 
                     an occupation or profession. The exact implementation of those 
 
                     ideals change, as do the laws of our land, but the ideals 
 
                     themselves remain hard and fast. This code of ethics is a 
 
                     first cut at the laws of the land. It is an important and 
 
                     necessary step in creating the discipline of software engineering. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>2. The following imperatives can not be measured in the present 
 
                     form:</p>
 
                   <p>1.02 Assure that they understand fully the specifications 
 
                     for the software on which they work. </p>
 
                   <p>Aspirational. </p>
 
                   <p>The real measure of understanding the specifications is to 
 
                     build the system. Short of that, there could possibly be some 
 
                     rating or assessment by the customer, but that would be very 
 
                     subjective. </p>
 
                   <p>1.09 Assure proper goals and objectives for any project on 
 
                     which they work. </p>
 
                   <p>Reword to emphasize alignment of goals and objectives with 
 
                     specifications of the product; expectations of the customer; 
 
                     and goals, objectives, and expectations of the employer. e.g. 
 
                     &quot;Assure goals and objectives for any project on which 
 
                     they work, align with the expectations, goals, and objectives 
 
                     of the customer and employer.&quot; This assumes the customer 
 
                     and employer have such expectations, goals, and objectives 
 
                     (a reasonable assumption). </p>
 
                   <p>1.06 Assure proper management on any project on which they 
 
                     work, including proper procedures for control of quality and 
 
                     risk. Some more words to elaborate &quot;proper&quot; management 
 
                     are needed. Proper procedures for quality and risk are not 
 
                     enough. Should include management of &quot;*ileitis&quot;. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>5.01 Associate only with reputable businesses. </p>
 
                   <p>Reputable is pretty hard to measure, but should at least 
 
                     include some examples of non-reputable businesses, such as 
 
                     those involved in criminal activities or those whose members 
 
                     violate the imperatives given in rules 2 and 3. </p>
 
                   <p>5.11 Serve In chic affairs constructively. </p>
 
                   <p>Aspirational. </p>
 
                   <p>&quot;Constructively&quot; should be explained and should 
 
                     be more quantifiable, if possible. However, this one seems 
 
                     to be a &quot;know it when you see it&quot; type. </p>
 
                   <p>NEW ONE </p>
 
                   <p>1.15 Assure the quality of the product meets the quality

                   <p>Student 11 </p>
 
                   <p>Generally, I liked this Software Engineering Code of Ethics. 
 
                     The Code of Ethics seem to embody the ideas of integrity, 
 
                     honesty, and professionalism. For the most part, the rules 
 
                     and imperatives are based on practicing good common sense 
 
                     and judgment that everyone should do daily. The three imperatives 
 
                     that I did not think belonged to this Code of Ethics are 9.01, 
 
                     5.07, and 5.11. I think that the basic concept underlying 
 
                     9.01 is achieved when all the other ones are followed. Also, 
 
                     one may just be learning a new area of expertise and will 
 
                     gain more competence with time. Imperative 9.01 seems to discourage 
 
                     trying to venture out and explore new ideas. I do not think 
 
                     imperative 5.07 should be in this code because fairness of 
 
                     salary is subjective. Employers and employees usually seem 
 
                     to differ in what they consider is appropriate therefore, 
 
                     it should be worked out between them and not be mandated by 
 
                     code. Perhaps it was the phrasing but imperative 5.11 seemed 
 
                     out of place in the list for rule 5. 1 think that as good 
 
                     citizens we are responsible to deserve in civic affairs constructively 
 
                     but this in no way effects us as good Software Engineers. 
 
                     I think that having a Code of Ethics is good because it gives 
 
                     people known standards that they must all abide. I think that 
 
                     the usefulness of the code really depends on individuals since 
 
                     no one monitors them. Each and every one is ultimately responsible 
 
                     for practicing their own ethical day-to-day behavior. </p>
 
                   <p>The six aspirational imperatives I found are 1.09, 1.10, 
 
                     1.13, 3.01, 6.09, and 6.13. Three of these imperatives cannot 
 
                     be reworded and are purely aspirational. The first 1.13 could 
 
                     not be change because I think trying to maximize productivity 
 
                     and minimize cost can be achieved in numerous different ways 
 
                     specific for each project. I think that the only way to capture 
 
                     is intention to apply to everyone is to keep it aspirational. 
 
                     The next imperative 6.09 is also aspirational. I think that 
 
                     every company has its own way documenting criticisms. Furthermore, 
 
                     criticizing someone is highly subjective and can be viewed 
 
                     as fair by one and bias by another. This makes it hard to 
 
                     quantify. The last imperative 6.13 is another idea that is 
 
                     hard to define as concrete set of activities which can apply 
 
                     to everyone. Fair and just compensation is interpreted differently 
 
                     by everyone. </p>
 
                   <p>I think that the other three aspirational imperatives can 
 
                     be reworded. 1.09 can be changed to Assure that the objectives 
 
                     and goals set for each project address needs of the projects 
 
                     customers. The word proper in the original wording is too 
 
                     subjective. For 1.10, I think that the wording should be changed 
 
                     to Assure that software and related documents on which they 
 
                     work respect the privacy of those subject to the software 
 
                     by informing and gaining permission whenever Necessary. This 
 
                     gives a way to ensure privacy to safeguarded. Then, for imperative 
 
                     3.01, the wording should be maintain honesty and professional 
 
                     objectivity against outside influences when evaluating any 
 
                     software or related documents To me this is better defined 
 
                     than the original phrasing. </p>

                   <p>Student 12 </p>
 
                   <p>1.a. General Comments on this Code of Ethics. </p>
 
                   <p>I think it's an excellent idea and a vital step in establishing 
 
                     software engineering as a discipline. The code establishes 
 
                     a baseline for ethical activity within the software engineering 
 
                     community and serves to &quot;legitimize&quot; the profession 
 
                     to those outside the software engineering community. </p>
 
                   <p>1.6. Three imperatives that should not be part of this code 
 
                     of ethics: </p>
 
                   <p>9.02 Assure that any document upon which they rely has been 
 
                     approved by someone qualified to approve it. </p>
 
                   <p>This places too much of the burden on the person relying 
 
                     on the document and not enough responsibility on the person 
 
                     that approved the document. Also, this should be covered by 
 
                     the approver's ethics under 2.03 (Affix their signature only 
 
                     to documents prepared under their supervision and within their 
 
                     areas of competence.). </p>
 
                   <p>5.07. Only accept a salary appropriate to professional qualifications. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>What does this mean? I have always been leery about the use 
 
                     of the terminology &quot;appropriate salary&quot;. Who is 
 
                     to say what is appropriate? The market should dictate how 
 
                     much (or how little) software engineers, basketball players, 
 
                     and AFIT instructors should make. I would not consider it 
 
                     unethical to be paid more for performing the same ethical 
 
                     work as my counterpart in another company-- I would consider 
 
                     myself lucky and worth every penny.</p>
 
                   <p>5.10. Serve in civic affairs constructively. </p>
 
                   <p>&quot;Constructively&quot; according to who? Assuming civic 
 
                     affairs means your conduct as a citizen in the community, 
 
                     I disagree. Your ethics in your lob may very well overlap 
 
                     into your private life, but it should not be part of the code 
 
                     of ethics for your profession. This is a privacy issue. If 
 
                     Joe (or Joanne) Software Engineer behaves ethically in his/her 
 
                     profession, yet is an active member of the Communist Party 
 
                     and hopes to replace the present government with Communism 
 
                     (which by some, would certainly not be considered constructive), 
 
                     so be it. This should not be considered unethical, as far 
 
                     as his/her professional conduct as a software engineer. </p>
 
                   <p>1.c. General feelings on definition/use/application of any 
 
                     code of ethics: </p>
 
                   <p>I think it's not only practical, but necessary to have a 
 
                     code of ethics documented for a particular profession. For 
 
                     some people, ethical behavior is innate and they would adhere 
 
                     to the code without even knowing of its ...stones. They would 
 
                     only need the code to specify the particular application of 
 
                     ethics to what they do in their job. For others, although 
 
                     they may be expected to engage in ethical behavior most times, 
 
                     they must have things &quot;spelled out&quot; as to what ethical 
 
                     behavior is in their line of work, so no claim can be made 
 
                     that, &quot;I didn't know...&quot;. Unfortunately, there are 
 
                     still others that cannot be expected to behave ethically, 
 
                     and a documented code (that they have ascribed to formally 
 
                     by literally signing up to it, or informally by just being 
 
                     a member of the profession) serves to stipulate the particular 
 
                     case when a member of the profession violates the code by 
 
                     behaving unethically. </p>
 
                   <p>Any profession that directly or indirectly has an impact 
 
                     on the health, safety, and welfare of people (which software 
 
                     engineering does, without question), should have a code of 
 
                     ethics at its core. If you had a nuclear reactor being built 
 
                     in your backyard, you would surely want the people designing 
 
                     the structure to behave ethically, so as not to endanger anyone. 
 
                     The same is true for the people that develop the software 
 
                     to run the nuclear reactor-- there is no difference between 
 
                     (preventable) substandard design or use of materials that 
 
                     cause a catastrophe and a (preventable) error in software 
 
                     that causes a catastrophe. As with all codes of ethics, this 
 
                     code could be replaced by a strict adherence to the &quot;Golden 
 
                     Rule&quot;. </p>
 
                   <p>2. Six &quot;aspirational&quot; imperatives: </p>
 
                   <p>1.03 Assure that they are qualified, by education and experience, 
 
                     for any project on which they work. (can be nothing more than 
 
                     aspirational) </p>
 
                   <p>Qualifications are important to work on any project, and 
 
                     software engineers should avoid working on projects when they 
 
                     are not qualified. I take this to mean a project where the 
 
                     software engineer is clearly &quot;in over their head&quot;. 
 
                     There is a lot to be said about on-the-job training and &quot;experience&quot;, 
 
                     where the software engineer becomes qualified to work on such 
 
                     a project only as a result of working on the project. </p>
 
                   <p>1.09 Assure proper goals and objectives for any project on 
 
                     which they work. (can be nothing more than aspirational) </p>
 
                   <p>This is a matter of perspective, focus, and definition. A 
 
                     software engineer working on the details of a system may not 
 
                     know about or care about the goals or objectives for the overall 
 
                     system. In addition, these overall goals may detract from 
 
                     the sub goals he or she needs to concentrate on. Finally, 
 
                     the term &quot;proper&quot; is extremely subjective. (The 
 
                     term &quot;proper&quot; is also used on 1.05, 1.06, 1.07, 
 
                     1.09-- 1.08 uses another subjective term, adequate) </p>
 
                   <p>9.07 Inform client or employer promptly if, in their opinion, 
 
                     a project is likely to fail, to prove too expensive, to violate 
 
                     copyright laws, or otherwise turn out badly. (split and reword, 
 
                     &quot;turn out badly&quot; is much too subjective) </p>
 
                   <p>9.07.1 Inform client or employer promptly if, in their opinion, 
 
                     a project is likely to fail to meet schedule or budget constraints 
 
                     beyond prescribed tolerances. </p>
 
                   <p>9.07.2 Inform client or employer promptly if, in their opinion, 
 
                     a project is likely to violate established law, including: 
 
                     copyright laws, patent laws, trademark laws, etc. </p>
 
                   <p>5.01 Associate only with reputable businesses. (can be nothing 
 
                     more than aspirational) </p>
 
                   <p>Major Kanko, are you now or have you ever been a member of 
 
                     the Communist Party? While 5.01 sounds like a great idea, 
 
                     how could you possibly enforce it? Who defines what's reputable? 
 
                     If the CEO of a company gets a DWI, is that good reason not 
 
                     to associate with the company any longer? This could possibly 
 
                     be reworded to state, &quot;avoid businesses that have documented 
 
                     cases of unethical behavior&quot;, but it would still be nothing 
 
                     more than inspirational, because of the subjective terminology. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>5.09 Help develop an organizational environment favorable 
 
                     to acting ethically. (can be nothing more than aspirational) 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>With terms such as &quot;Help&quot;, &quot;environment&quot;, 
 
                     and &quot;favorable&quot;, this is impossible to test. </p>
 
                   <p>6.01 Assist co-workers in professional development. (can 
 
                     be nothing more than aspirational) </p>
 
                   <p>This would be quite an accomplishment in practice, but can 
 
                     be nothing more than aspirational, since assistance could 
 
                     only be encouraged, and can't be measured. </p>

                   <p>Student 13 </p>
 
                   <p>In general, I approve of a code of ethics for software engineers. 
 
                     I believe that ethics are an important part of any profession 
 
                     because it sets a standard of conduct that members of the 
 
                     profession should be able to rely on. I, personally, would 
 
                     like to be able to rely on the ethical behavior of my employees, 
 
                     my professional associates, my fellow workers and my employers. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Whether a code of ethics becomes part of a certification 
 
                     process for software engineers or not it will still be useful 
 
                     as it provides a forum for discussing and debating ethical 
 
                     issues related to our profession. Even if Software engineers 
 
                     never have a certification process, individual employers or 
 
                     professional societies may decide to use it as guidelines/rules 
 
                     for ethical behavior within </p>
 
                   <p>It is important in all levels of society that `appropriate' 
 
                     behavior be the norm.</p>
 
                   <p>In many groups behavior standards for attitude, work habits, 
 
                     appearance, language, dress etc. are defined, trained and 
 
                     enforced. Ethical behavior standards can be fuzzier than other 
 
                     types of behavior standards yet they, in my opinion, form 
 
                     the foundation for all other standards. Ethical behavior standards 
 
                     need to be defined, trained and enforced. A code of ethics 
 
                     is an important part of defining ethical behavior standards 
 
                     but it is not the only part. </p>
 
                   <p>The specific code of ethics used in the homework 2 handout, 
 
                     in my opinion, has problems. I see no real problems with the 
 
                     7 Rules. I would change or eliminate many of the specific 
 
                     application general problems with them is that 1) There are 
 
                     too many of them. 2) They are inconsistent in form/meaning 
 
                     somehow. The fact that prescriptive and aspirational statements 
 
                     are intermixed could be part of the problem. They also appear 
 
                     to be written by different people at different times for different 
 
                     reasons. </p>
 
                   <p>In particular, I found many of the application statements 
 
                     (only some are listed) fell within the following problem classes: 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Some application statements... 1) do not belong in the code 
 
                     of ethics or are out of place (1.19, 6.07) </p>
 
                   <p>2) are too vague and could be interpreted in several different 
 
                     ways (1.09, 1.19, 6.11) 3) are redundant and restate other 
 
                     statements in a more specific or more general way (1.08, Most 
 
                     of 3.0x) 9) concern issues outside of ethical conduct (5.11, 
 
                     5.12) 5) are too emphatic about a generalized issue which 
 
                     is not black and white in many cases (1.03, 1.10, 2.06, 5.07, 
 
                     6.08) and some were in more than one of the above classes. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>The following statements do not belong in the code of ethics. 
 
                     Statement 1.09 &quot;Assure proper goals and objectives for 
 
                     any project on which they work&quot; falls into categories 
 
                     1, 2 and 9. Is software that controls a nuclear missile `proper'? 
 
                     What about software that aids in the abortion process? What 
 
                     about software that enables crackers to break into systems 
 
                     (or helps US [information] war fighters break into enemy systems? 
 
                     or helps security teams determine if a system is vulnerable 
 
                     to crackers?) In many cases there is not an inherent 'proper' 
 
                     or `improper' usage of the project. In addition, this statement 
 
                     also has an implicit OR (&quot;Assure proper goals and objectives 
 
                     for any project on which they work OR...&quot;) which is left 
 
                     unstated. Two better statements are &quot;Inform the appropriate 
 
                     authorities if your project, product or work will be used 
 
                     for illegal purposes&quot; , and &quot;If you believe your 
 
                     work will be used for immoral (but not illegal) purposes quit, 
 
                     or inform your employer and ask to be moved to a different 
 
                     project&quot;. </p>
 
                   <p>All of the statements under Rule 3 JUDGMENT (except for the 
 
                     last one) are very poor. Statement 3.01 is too weak. `Professional 
 
                     skepticism' seems like a copout. How about &quot;Do not let 
 
                     any outside, non software engineering, issues influence your 
 
                     professional evaluation of software or related documents you 
 
                     are asked to evaluate&quot;. Statements 3.02-3.06 are all 
 
                     redundant to 3.07 I believe 3.07 is the general and 3.02-3.06 
 
                     are all specific instances so get rid of them. 3.02 is against 
 
                     the law and should not have to be restated so directly in 
 
                     a code of ethics. 3.03 and 3.09 have the 'disclosure' phrase 
 
                     which allows the behavior under full disclosure to all concerned 
 
                     parties. 3.05 and 3.06 do not have the 'disclosure' phrase 
 
                     yet I believe the issues are the same as those involved with 
 
                     3.03 and 3.09!. Why include the disclosure phrase on 3.03 
 
                     and 3.09 and not on 3.05 and 3.06? In addition, statement 
 
                     3.06 introduces a paradox because if it were in the code of 
 
                     ethics and enforced, then (because of the self reference problem) 
 
                     no software engineer could participate in modifying or changing 
 
                     the rules of behavior for software engineers as most rules 
 
                     could have a financial impact to them personally and through 
 
                     out the industry. i.e. with this rule in place can software 
 
                     engineers ethically establish a certification process for 
 
                     themselves so they can truly become &quot;engineers&quot;. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>If it is established as a rule can they ethically change 
 
                     the code as any change will inevitably affect them financially 
 
                     and thus they will be breaking the rule? </p>
 
                   <p>Statement 6.07 seems out of place. It is too specific an 
 
                     issue and seems out of place under Rule 6: COLLEAGUES. It 
 
                     seems r11 stated as well. i.e. &quot;Software Engineers shall 
 
                     assure co-workers know the employer's policies and procedures 
 
                     for protecting passwords, files and other confidential information.&quot; 
 
                     This is too proactive for me, am I supposed to go to my colleagues 
 
                     and quiz them on their knowledge .... or just inform them 
 
                     if the situation comes up? And why just single out those policies 
 
                     and procedures for &quot;protecting passwords, files and other 
 
                     confidential information&quot;? Why not include software engineering 
 
                     methods and documentation standards and a whole host of other 
 
                     things. </p>
 
                   <p>&quot;Aspirational&quot; statements. I do not have a problem 
 
                     with &quot;aspirational&quot; statements in a code of ethics. 
 
                     It might help to have two sections of statements under each 
 
                     of the rules. Those that are aspirational and those that are 
 
                     prescriptive. There are problems with being too specific or 
 
                     being too general. If you are too specific you will inevitably 
 
                     leave out instances of unethical behavior and there will be 
 
                     people that (after doing the unethical behavior) will point 
 
                     out that such behavior is not expressly denied. I believe 
 
                     that trying to cover all cases is doomed to fail as there 
 
                     is no way to be complete and technology changes and it is 
 
                     tough to keep up with it. However, if you are too general 
 
                     there will be people that will maintain that certain unethical 
 
                     behavior isn't covered under one of the broad sweeping statements 
 
                     or they will maintain that some ethical behavior is actually 
 
                     unethical because it seems to be covered by one of the statements. 
 
                     Basically, extremes with either thought process are no-win 
 
                     situations. I think the middle ground is best. Provide some 
 
                     aspirational statements as guidelines and some prescriptive 
 
                     statements as concrete examples. </p>
 
                   <p>Some of the statements I would leave as aspirational or change 
 
                     to be more prescriptive and measurable are: </p>
 
                   <p>1.02 &quot;Assure that they understand fully the specifications 
 
                     for software on which they work&quot; Leave as aspirational 
 
                     OR get rid of. The only way to measure understanding in this 
 
                     case is to test it which is silly. Imagine all software engineers 
 
                     being required to take a test on the requirements... who would 
 
                     grade it? Also, at what point is the test taken? Obviously 
 
                     one must have spent some time studying the requirements and 
 
                     performing analysis and design functions as software engineering 
 
                     is an iterative process. </p>
 
                   <p>1.12 &quot;Assure ethical, economic, cultural, legal and 
 
                     environmental issues are properly identified, defined, and 
 
                     addressed&quot; Leave as aspirational. Perhaps these issues 
 
                     can be codified into a software engineering method in the 
 
                     future some time but for now there is not enough meat on these 
 
                     issues to even devise a true engineering scheme for them. 
 
                     In addition, what is `proper' concerning these issues is not 
 
                     black and white. No group of people could agree on many specific 
 
                     examples related to these issues. A simple question like &quot;Will 
 
                     producing and marketing system x change the culture of the 
 
                     people that use it?&quot; does not have a definitive answer. 
 
                     This is not even the important question (unless you are one 
 
                     of the `true believers' that think that all change is inherently 
 
                     bad). The more important question, &quot;Will the change be 
 
                     for the better of for the worse?&quot;, has no definitive 
 
                     answer either. Also, what is `bad' in the short term may be 
 
                     `good' in the long term. </p>
 
                   <p>1.19 &quot;Avoid fads, departing from standard practices 
 
                     only when justified&quot; Leave as aspirational OR get rid 
 
                     of OR restate by defining &quot;fads&quot; better and the 
 
                     conditions better. One persons `fad' is another person's silver 
 
                     bullet! If we don't try new things we will never progress 
 
                     and codifying the conditions under which new things can be 
 
                     tried. Codifying existing practices as the `correct' ones 
 
                     may reduce the likelihood that the new things will ever become 
 
                     standards! If I were to restate this I would include a risk 
 
                     analysis assessment and a `disclosure' phrase similar to those 
 
                     used in 3.03 and 3.09. </p>
 
                   <p>5.09 &quot;Help develop an organizational environment favorable 
 
                     to acting ethically&quot; This could be changed to be more 
 
                     prescriptive. &quot;Help.... by acting ethically in all ways 
 
                     yourself, promoting this code of ethics where possible, denouncing 
 
                     unethical behavior whenever you see it, .. These additions 
 
                     (and others) may not be that statement much more `testable' 
 
                     but at least they give an indication of some of the practices 
 
                     that are expected.</p>
 
                   <p>7.01-7.06 &quot;Improve their knowledge/ability/understanding... 
 
                     All of these are aspirational. There are many ways to make 
 
                     these statements more testable but I would argue against that. 
 
                     For example, the 'teaching profession' and many others require 
 
                     improvement efforts (i.e. additional course work) on a regular 
 
                     basis. These requirements include additional training or `classes' 
 
                     of training that are needed periodically. A problem with this 
 
                     approach is that a whole cottage industry has grown up providing 
 
                     some of the other professions with the `required' self improvements 
 
                     needed to maintain their certification. I would argue that 
 
                     codifying the improvement would inevitably mean establishing 
 
                     a minimum to which many individuals would now 'aspire' to. 
 
                     Also the inevitable cottage industry would arise which would 
 
                     be oriented towards satisfying the letter of the requirement 
 
                     and not the spirit. </p>
 
                   <p>-------------------------------------------- </p>
 
                   <p>Student 19 </p>
 
                   <p>General Comments On This Code Of Ethics </p>
 
                   <p>Overall, I think it's a fairly well-conceived code of ethics, 
 
                     containing both strong and weak points. legitimate engineering 
 
                     discipline, I believe such a code must be established. In 
 
                     particular, its strengths lie interest, professional judgment, 
 
                     client and employer relationships, professional advancement, 
 
                     treatment of colleagues, and self endeavors. I feel the code 
 
                     comes up short in the are, me, though, since it seems so much 
 
                     harder to define a software product than it does to define 
 
                     hardware-oriented engineering products (electrical, mechanical, 
 
                     etc.). If it's intrinsically more difficult to define the 
 
                     product of a process, it seems only logical that it is equally 
 
                     as difficult to apply professional criteria to such products. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Imperatives That Should Not Belong To This Code </p>
 
                   <p>I feel all the imperatives have a place in the code. They 
 
                     all address areas of concern to the discipline of software 
 
                     engineering. I looked very hard at all the imperatives and 
 
                     for each one was able to visualize a scenario in which the 
 
                     imperative could have a professional impact, either on an 
 
                     individual or corporeal basis. </p>
 
                   <p>Applicability Of Any Code Of Ethics </p>
 
                   <p>As I stated earlier, I believe a code of ethics is imperative 
 
                     for any body of professionals seeking public recognition as 
 
                     an engineering discipline. This gives the body a common ground 
 
                     against which all members may be judged. </p>
 
                   <p>Aspirational Imperatives </p>
 
                   <p>I feel the following three imperatives are aspirational at 
 
                     best. They simply have no hard and fast measurements against 
 
                     which they may be gauged. </p>
 
                   <p>1.07 Assure proper estimates of cost, schedule, personnel, 
 
                     and outcome on any project on which they work. It is rare 
 
                     that a software project of any respectable size is delivered 
 
                     on time and within budget. Until a consistently reliable time/cost 
 
                     estimation methodology is developed for software, this imperative 
 
                     will continue to be an immeasurable one. </p>
 
                   <p>1.05 Assure proper development methodology on any project 
 
                     on which they work. Who defines what is the &quot;proper&quot; 
 
                     development methodology for a particular project? Many development 
 
                     methodologies exist, and in many cases, more than one may 
 
                     be applicable. Yet the question remains: how can one methodology 
 
                     be gauged as more proper than another? </p>
 
                   <p>1.06 Assure proper management on any project on which they 
 
                     work, including proper procedures for control of quality and 
 
                     risk. The same type of argument applies here. Who can determine 
 
                     whether or not a proper style of management is being applied? 
 
                     Obviously, is a project is failing, you might want to take 
 
                     a hard look at management. But whether or not management is 
 
                     proper is really only determinable by whether or not the project 
 
                     is ultimately successful. Therefore it cannot be fully measured 
 
                     as long as it is in progress. </p>

                   <p>Student 15 </p>
 
                   <p>1. a. In general, I think this code of ethics is fairly good. 
 
                     It focuses on seven general areas, all of which 7 think are 
 
                     appropriate, and cover the ground a professional code of ethics 
 
                     should. </p>
 
                   <p>b. The following subsidiary clauses are inappropriate for 
 
                     inclusion: </p>
 
                   <p>1.19: This particular clause may encourage software engineers 
 
                     not to try new things that may advance the state of technology. 
 
                     Just because something is considered a fad doesn't mean that 
 
                     there isn't justification for using it. It could be argued 
 
                     that, several years ago, object oriented was a fad. Now it 
 
                     is standard practice, and that may not have happened if its 
 
                     use had been discouraged because it was a &quot;fad.&quot; 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>5.07: Who's to say what a &quot;salary appropriate to professional 
 
                     qualifications&quot; is. Putting an artificial ceiling on 
 
                     what people can earn simply isn't the American way. If we 
 
                     let salaries be determined by the free market, people will 
 
                     be paid what they are worth. Amore appropriate wording may 
 
                     be, &quot;Do not overstate qualifications for the sake of 
 
                     getting a higher salary.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>5.11 -- A person's decision whether or not to participate 
 
                     in &quot;civic affairs&quot; is entirely their own, and has 
 
                     no bearing whatsoever on their status as an upstanding professional 
 
                     software engineer. This clause should be =v that we should 
 
                     need codes of ethics in it is necessary. It is important to 
 
                     have a minimal at which to hold people, because, as with any 
 
                     profession, a small number of people lacking ethics will find 
 
                     their way in. </p>
 
                   <p>2. The following clauses are not easily measurable, and should 
 
                     be at least considered for rewording: </p>
 
                   <p>5.01: It is impossible to measure what is or is not a &quot;reputable&quot; 
 
                     business. Certainly, some businesses (i.e. the Mafia) are 
 
                     considered disreputable by all and should not be associated 
 
                     with by right-standing engineers. Other businesses fall into 
 
                     a gray area, and it is simply not possible to threshold of 
 
                     &quot;reputability.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>1.05: How does one measure whether or not a &quot;proper&quot; 
 
                     development methodology has been used? Perhaps a better wording 
 
                     would be, &quot;Upon choosing a development methodology, the 
 
                     software engineer should document and be able to defend the 
 
                     reasoning behind choosing that particular methodology.&quot; 
 
                     This wording would at least allow the question to be answered 
 
                     yes or no. 1.09: This clause is worded very similarly to 1.05, 
 
                     and is not measurable. I would suggest, &quot;A software engineer 
 
                     should be capable of properly defending his documented goals 
 
                     and objectives for any projects.&quot; 3.01: What is &quot;professional 
 
                     skepticism&quot; and how is it measured? I assume this means 
 
                     that an evaluator should always assume that the product will 
 
                     &quot;break&quot; until it is proven otherwise. If this is 
 
                     the case, the clause will probably remain aspirational, but 
 
                     should be worded more clearly. 5.09: It is impossible to measure 
 
                     whether or not one has contributed to &quot;developing an 
 
                     environment favorable to acting ethically.&quot; This clause, 
 
                     while necessary, is probably inherently immeasurable. 5.09: 
 
                     At what point does promoting ones own interest come at the 
 
                     expense of the profession? Once again, there is no way to 
 
                     establish an acceptable threshold. This clause is also inherently 
 
                     immeasurable.</p>
