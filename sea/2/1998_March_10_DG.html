                     Please sent me the specifics as soon as you can. Does the

                     INTRODUCTION<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     BACKGROUND<br>
 
                     In May of 1993, the Board of, Governors of the IEEE-CS established 
 
                     a steering committee for evaluating, planning, and coordinating 
 
                     actions related to establishing software engineering as a 
 
                     profession. In that same year the ACM Council endorsed the 
 
                     establishment of a Commission on Software Engineering. By 
 
                     January of 1994, both societies formed a joint steering committee 
 
                     &#8220;To establish the appropriate set(s) of<br>
 
                     standards for professional practice of Software Engineering 
 
                     upon which industrial decisions, professional certification, 
 
                     and educational curricula can be based.&#8221; To accomplish 
 
                     these they made the following recommendations:<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     1. adopt standard definitions<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     2, define required body of knowledge and recommended practices<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     3. define ethical<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     4. define educational curricula for undergraduate, graduate(MS 
 
                     and continuing education (for retraining and migration)<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     The steering committee decided to accomplish these tasks through 
 
                     the establishment of a series of task forces. Initially the 
 
                     task forces established were: Software Engineering Body of 
 
                     Knowledge and Recommended Practices, Software Engineering 
 
                     Ethics and Professional Practices, and Software Engineering 
 
                     Curriculum. The purpose of the Software Engineering ethics 
 
                     and professional practices task force is to document the ethical 
 
                     and professional responsibilities and obligations of software 
 
                     engineers.<br>

                     sample as much as possible. The background info may be made 
 
                     smaller later because of the 2500 words limit. This is taken 
 
                     from IEEE CS Computer Mag Nov 97 P88. Should we <br>

                     URLs For This Column</p>
 
                   <p> QUESTIONS:<br>
 
                     1. Observations are from my view on sub committee and task 
 
                     force - should I use &quot;I&quot; or &quot;We&quot; ?<br>
 
                     We<br>
 
                     2. I am from industry not university - does it matter? But 
 
                     I am a Certified Computer Professional.<br>
 
                     doesn't matter<br>
 
                     3. Do we need approval for acknowledgments? I will get from 
 
                     sub committee but task force members are on web site and magazines.<br>
 
                     Not sure what you mean here. Yes, you have to acknowledge 
 
                     the subcommittee members. How many are there?<br>
 
                     4. Planning for Sept/Oct issue - OK?<br>
 
                     That will have a deadline around end of June, I'll have to 
 
                     get back to you with specifics. Could you do it earlier?<br>
 
                     5. What format do you want column in? I use WORD 6.0a but 
 
                     can translate to other formats.<br>
 
                     We need HTML that is readable (with the tags) in a plain ascii 
 
                     editor.<br>
 
                     6. Do you want entire column at one time or as parts are<br>
 
                     completed?<br>
 
                     I'd like to see an early draft of the whole thing, even if 
 
                     some parts aren't filled in yet. Remember the whole thing 
 
                     shouldn't go over 2500 words. If it does, IEEE will cut it 
 
                     down to that size anyway.<br>
 
                     7. A professor at IIT is doing an in-depth study of using 
 
                     e-mail. Is it OK to reference him in column with his permission?<br>
 
                     Yes.</p>

                     I think the special issue will be devoted to more specific 
 
                     technical advances. However, the development and review of 
 
                     the ethids code by email and Internet might make a nice short 
 
                     article for my regular Collaborative Work column. It appears 
 
                     in most issues, and I usually write with a co-author - actually, 
 
                     the co-author does most of the<br>
 
                     writing, I edit :-). A column is about 2500 words, and I'd 
 
                     need a draft at least three weeks before the publication deadline.

                   <p>Subject: Possible Paper</p>
 
                   <p>In your Sept/Oct issue of IEEE Internet Computing would you 
 
                     be interested in a paper on the development of the Software 
 
                     Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practices. It 
 
                     was developed by e-mail and reviewed on the net. This was 
 
                     a development of SEEPP a task force of the joint Steering 
 
                     Committee of IEEE-CS/<br>
 
                     ACM on making SE a Profession. See http://www.computer.org/tab/seprof/index.htm<br>
 
                     I think I can get a number of the task force members to work 
 
                     together on the paper. <br>
