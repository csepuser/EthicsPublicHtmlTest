       <p>The rationale for licensing &quot;software engineers&quot; is exactly 
         the same as the rationale for licensing other engineers. In both cases, 
         poor design can often endanger the safety and well being of the public. 
         Consequently, it is vital to make sure that those who design these products 
         are fully qualified by their education and experience to do that kind 
         of work. Moreover, it is important to be sure that they are fully aware 
         of their professional and legal responsibilities. Finally, it is important 
         to make sure that some authority can investigate and, where appropriate 
         punish those who are negligent and unethical. </p>
       <p>The mechanisms needed for licensing need be no different for software 
         engineers than they are for other engineers. The licensing authority must 
         be created by legislation and have the authority to enforce the legislation. 
         In particular, they must have the authority to remove a license from licensed 
         practitioners who do not follow established rules of good practice, and 
         they must have the ability to stop those who practice without a license 
         in situations where a license is required. </p>
       <p>The most efficient way to establish meaningful licensing for software 
         engineers is to recognize it as a new specialty within engineering. Engineering 
         has many specialties. There is a core of knowledge expected of all engineers; 
         this is supplemented by specific knowledge needed in each specialty. The 
         most difficult task facing us in the licensure of software engineers is 
         the identification of the special knowledge that should be required of 
         those who practice in this field. </p>
       <p>The other task required is the characterization of those types of software 
         development that must be under the control of a licensed Engineer specialising 
         in software. In those cases it is not necessary that all employees be 
         licensed software engineers, but the final product should bear the seal 
         of a licensed engineer who takes responsibility for the product's being 
         tit for use. </p>
       <p>ACM and IEEE can be of help to the Professional Engineering Societies 
         in these two tasks. </p>
       <p>A committee of can propose a description of the essential knowledge for 
         a software engineer. This description can NOT be determined simply by 
         asking today's programmers what they know. Most of them do not have the 
         appropriate training, skills, or knowledge. The committee must ask experts 
         what program designers SHOULD know in order to make sure that their products 
         are tit for use. </p>
       <p>Another committee can examine the many applications of software and determine 
         which of these are so critical that they should bear the seal of a professional 
         engineer who specializes in software. A characterization of this class 
         of software might need to be added to the legislation. </p>
       <p>As in all other areas of engineering, the body of knowledge and the principles 
         of good practice (Engineering principles) for software engineering are 
         evolving. As in each of the other areas the required body of knowledge 
         will have to be regularly updated and the exams will have to be altered 
         accordingly. Nonetheless, there is no reason why we cannot begin now. 
       </p>
       <p>Neither ACM nor IEEE should attempt to become a licensing authority. 
         It would be difficult and completely unnecessary, to obtain the necessary 
         legislation. In most cases the existing legislation is adequate but it 
         must be interpreted in a new way in the light of the rapid technological 
         developments of the last 25 years. If updates to the Engineering legislation 
         is needed, they should be proposed by the existing local Professional 
         Engineering societies.</p>
       <p>In summary, the time for instituting licensing software engineers is 
         already here. Legislation is in place and the need is great. The existing 
         organisations are the best ones to do the job provided that they receive 
         and accept advice from key professional societies and well established 
         experts in the fie<br>
