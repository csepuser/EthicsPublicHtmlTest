      <p>Hastings Center Report, Vol. 6, No. 1 (February 1976) pp. 45-46</p>
      <p>Environmental management is a growth industry. One environmental magazine
        reports its subscribers this year number thirty times those of five years
        ago. Environmental management is an investment in social good as well;
        but it is a difficult one to make. Since 1946, the ratio in America between
        social good and environmental cost has shifted. Then one beer bottle
        was reused an average of forty times. Now beer bottles and cans are usually
        used once. Then and now the USDA agricultural output per capita is approximately
        the same but now five times as much nitrogen fertilizer is used to maintain
        the ratio. The ways in which we produce our goods and use our resources
        have been transformed, at a substantial social cost. Americans have been
        awakening to that cost, and the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act
        was one expression of that awakening. </p>
      <p>The National Environmental Policy Act requires the government to describe
        the environmental impact of what it wants to do-say, open a nuclear power
        generating plant or close down some Peen Central branch lines- in an &#8220;environmental
        impact statement.&#8221; Many states have enacted similar legislation;
        and preparing environmental impact statements has thus become a major
        new task, one which requires interdisciplinary exchange and interaction.
        More-it requires those preparing such statements to interact with politicians,
        and with bureaucrats, with special interest groups and with persons from
        all social strata. Granted the best intentions (which are not so easily
        granted), understanding, tolerance, respect, and cooperation are slow
        to develop. </p>
      <p>In 1973, under increasing pressure to contribute to, prepare, and review
        environmental impact statements and faced with problems of conflict of
        interest and inadequate statements, some California environmental experts
        sought to establish an association which would help them cope with the
        new demands; and one of them immediately set about to design a code of
        ethical practice. In one year, membership in the California Association
        of Environmental Professionals increased from 40 to 450. The group began
        to achieve recognition from state governmental agencies, and private
        groups and corporations. It has a code of ethics, which concentrated
        on concerns common to professional working in the field. Why not a national
        association then?</p>
      <p>Indeed, it has appeared. The National Association of Environmental Professionals
        marked its official birth by the &#8220;Energy, Environment, and Ethics
        Seminar&#8221; November 5-7, 1975, presented in conjunction with George
        Washington University&#8217;s Continuing Engineering Education Program.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of invitations were sent out, but only 100 or so persons
        of diverse professions attended &#8211; accountants and economists, planners
        and architects and engineers, biologists, biochemists, mineralogists,
        and sociologists. The small turnout and diverse backgrounds of those
        in attendance suggest that environmental professionals are still not
        sure who they are. Coming from many different states and boasting disparate
        institutional affiliations, these academics, entrepreneurs, and government
        workers had in common simply their skills and responsibilities in the
        field of environmental management. All were concerned, as members of
        a budding profession, to define their roles and defend their turfs. In
        Washington it was politically and psychologically pressing for the association
        and its members to distinguish themselves from others for whom they may
        be mistaken. Speakers at the meeting were adament in dissociating themselves
        from what they called &#8220;professional environmentalists&#8221;: private
        citizens and &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; affiliated with non-professional
        environmental organizations.</p>
      <p>Environmental professionals usually have well-established professional
        identities within their respective but diverse fields, and they pay at
        least lip service to rules of scientific rigor, objectivity, careful
        data collection, description, and analysis. In contrast, professional
        environmentalists are considered to be amateurs lacking the capacities
        or training to fulfill these professional and scientific goals. Further,
        their ability to understand and assess the information offered by environmental
        professionals is sometimes called into question, as is that of the general
        public. </p>
      <p>At the Washington meeting environmental professionals often presumed
        their non-professional friends to be emotionally biased. Indeed they
        sometimes are. But unlike environmental professionals, the professional
        environmentalists are not searching for self-identification. They have
        firm personal, institutional, and ethical affiliations, which provide
        a degree of autonomy as well as certain accepted procedures, environmental
        professionals need to clarify and evaluate their general and disparate
        goals in light of their new integrative function. If they can do so,
        they may acquire a degree of autonomy; certain prerogatives will be granted
        them by other professionals and by clients, officials, and the public. </p>
      <p>Interestingly one of the first tasks of the National Association is
        to reassess and reformulate the California code of ethical practice in
        order to make it acceptable to a growing membership. The ad hoc board
        of directors sees the formulation and endorsement of such a code as an
        important step in identifying environmental professionals, defining their
        roles, and establishing their responsibilities and prerogatives. </p>
      <p>This development should catch the attention of those who have considered
        the place of ethical codes in other professions. No doubt, such codes
        have made some difference in how the professionals view themselves had
        how outsiders view them. But many professionals have pointed out that
        codes often have limited value when practitioners are faced with ethical
        difficulties in day-to-day practice. And general precepts may offer little
        reassurance to skeptical outsiders about the actual behavior of professionals.
        Skeptics question whether codes of ethics primarily serve professional
        self-interest by defining who are legitimate practitioners or genuinely
        maintain high quality services and protect unwary consumers.</p>
      <p>These issues could be seen lurking in the background when persons attending
        the November seminar raised questions about the draft code of ethical
        practice essentially based on the code of the California Association.
        Those professionals not directly concerned to prepare and review impact
        statements protested that the draft code seemed germane only to those
        who did prepare and review such statements. Already the National Association
        was faced with a question of finding a fit between its code and its plausible
        membership. Board members were immediately sensitive to this point. They
        wanted to make sure that environmental managers who did not prepare or
        review environmental impact statements did not feel excluded &#8211; a
        good political response. </p>
      <p>But the ethical considerations are broader. Whose perceptions of the
        ethical problems faced by a profession ought to be taken into account
        in formulating a code? Politicians, bureaucrats, industrialists, professional
        environmentalists, and the public generally have a stake in environmental
        management, and may have views quite different from professionals&#8217;.</p>
      <p>Whatever the final form of the code, vague or concrete, limited or broad,
        it is only in the association&#8217;s institutionalization of structures
        and procedures that code requirements can be given force. The draft code
        exhorts environmental professionals to disclose financial or personal
        interests in projects for which they write environmental impact statements.
        But how much of a financial interest, of what sort, is needed for there
        to be an ethical issue? What sorts of personal interests are being talked
        about: someone&#8217;s bias towards railroad as opposed to truck transport;
        someone&#8217;s concern for species survival, strong genetic pools, or
        national security; someone&#8217;s friendship with persons to stand to
        benefit from a particular recommendation? Persons attending the Washington
        meeting questioned the propriety of firms&#8217; doing their own environmental
        impact statements on projects they wish to initiate. Obviously such companies
        have substantial financial and personal interests in the outcome. Is
        the simple disclosure of such interests enough? Should the code disallow
        statements prepared by those who stand to benefit substantially from
        project approval? Will a stipulation in the code that environmental professionals
        enumerate in their statements each available alternative to the preferred
        project, including the &#8220;no-build or null alternative,&#8221; be
        sufficient? Should the code suggest a role for public interest or community
        groups in the preparation or review of impact statements? Should the
        association review statements where conflict of interest is likely, or
        acknowledged, or alleged? Should the association censure professionals,
        private firms, governmental agencies, or community groups that suppress
        information or give misleading information? What role should environmental
        professionals or the association play in the legislative process? It
        is in creating procedures for dealing with specific problems of conflicting
        interests that a code of ethical practice can be kept relevant to the
        day-to-day ethical concerns of professionals and non-professionals alike. </p>
      <p>Other important ethical problems remain. For example, persons attending
        told stories of environmental professionals who were fired for honesty,
        of others who wrote reports which their clients shelved because they
        did not support client interests. Should the association play a role
        in support of environmental managers who find themselves punished for
        ethical practice? Unless some provisions for dealing with these sorts
        of problems are provided, the code seems likely to be weak. Other questions
        persist. Should the association certify or license professionals? Should
        the association censure those who perform incompetently or in bad faith
        or leave the prerogative to the courts?</p>
      <p>From another angle, what does constitute a good environmental impact
        statement? What criteria and standards are important? Which forms of
        expertise are essential? The general statements in the draft code point
        in the right direction, but they are not in themselves sufficiently specific
        to be helpful to professionals suddenly thrust into new and complicated
        projects. The association might provide its members a helpful service
        by pledging its responsibility, say, to collect and distribute good environmental
        impact statements, or to analyze various statements and distribute the
        results of that analysis. Only in such ways are vague, encoded ethical
        exhortations likely to be translated into practice. </p>
      <p>Finally, one task which a standing committee on ethics in the National
        Association of Environmental Professionals might assign itself for coming
        years is an assessment of the ethical problems which inhere in the relationship
        between its profession and the federal government. The government often
        sponsors environmental research, offers environmental professionals employment,
        and acts as their client. Consider, for example, the ostensible conflict
        between the value of &#8220;national security&#8221; and its constant &#8220;secrecy&#8221; and
        the association&#8217;s values of &#8220;full disclosure&#8221; and &#8220;public
        participation,&#8221; as enunciated in the draft code. Consider the ethical
        difficulties that may arise over government procedures in funding research:
        to cover its costs, a firm may continue to do research it knows to be
        inferior or irrelevant. Consider governmental demands for quick answers
        where there may be none. The formation of a National Association seems
        a natural response to new conditions created by our concern for environmental
        management; but students of ethical codes and professionalism generally
        will be keepign an eye out for the long-range &#8220;environmental impact&#8221; of
        another new profession. <br>
