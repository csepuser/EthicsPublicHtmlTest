       <p>1. Introductions</p>
       <p>This was the third meeting of the Software Engineering Coordinating
         Committee (SWECC), a joint activity of the ACM and the IEEE Computer
         Society (CS). Gerald Engel attended the first part of the meeting to
         report on the progress of the Software Engineering Education Project
         (SWEEP). Mark Ardis volunteered to prepare the minutes of the meeting
         (Action Item 3 1).</p>
       <p>The minutes of the first SWECC meeting and of the second (teleconference)
         meeting were approved. '</p>
       <p>2. Review of action items</p>
       <p>The committee reviewed the list of action items, noting those that had
         been completed, and setting new completion dates for those that had not
         been completed.</p>
       <p>3. ICSE Report</p>
       <p>Mark Ardis and Doris Carver reported on SWECC related activity at the
         recent International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). David
         _ Notkin, chairman of ACM SIGSOFT,, reported the ACM's position on licensing
         of software professionals at the annual open SIGSOFT meeting. While the
         ACM supports the education activities of SWECC, it is not ready to support
         the preparation of licensing exams. This viewpoint provoked many of the
         attendees of the SIGSOFT meeting, so that nearly the entire meeting was
         spent discussing licensing.</p>
       <p>Mark Ardis gave an overview of the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge
         (SWEBOK) project at a birds of a feather meeting arranged by Don Baggert.
         The SWEBOK project provided the slides for the meeting. Several attendees
         noted the web address of SWEBOK, and several expressed interest in participating
         as reviewers.</p>
       <p>4. Education Project Report</p>
       <p>Gerald Engel gave an informal report of progress on the Software Engineering
         Education Project(SWEEP). The project has been working on 3 models of
         programs in software engineering: undergraduate, graduate (masters).,
         and pre professional. The undergraduate model has been completed. The
         graduate model is almost done., and a draft will be sent to the sponsoring
         societies soon. The preprofessional model has had the least progress,
         but an initial draft is expected this fall.</p>
       <p>Concern was raised about the integration of CSAB and ABET. The plan
         was for CSAB to become the lead entity for accreditation reviews of software
         engineering programs. However,, ABET seems to be waiting for more information
         from CSAB. It was agreed that SWECC needs to be proactive in helping
         this integration. (Action Item 3.2)</p>
       <p>SWEEP is planning a 3 day workshop to build consensus for software engineering
         education. They expect to have 30-40 attendees, who would submit position
         statements in order to qualify for an invitation. Besides building consensus,
         the workshop is intended to produce useful educational materials, provide
         some assessment of existing programs, and include some practitioner interaction.</p>
       <p>We discussed possible funding sources for the SWEEP workshop, which
         is expected to cost about $60,.000. The National Science Foundation (NSF)
         might be willing to pay for half if matching support could be obtained
         from someone else. One suggestion was to ask professional societies from
         other countries to support participants from their countries. For example,
         the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) might be asked to support
         Canadian participants.</p>
       <p>SWEEP is coordinating its work with 2 other efforts: Curriculum 2001
         (C2001) and the Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices
         Project (SEEPP). Members of SWEEP are participating in C2001. There was
         some confusion over the ACM position with respect to SWECC projects (Action
         Item 3 3).</p>
       <p>Finally, SWEEP was concerned with a need for publicity. How will the
         software industry and the general public become aware of SWECC's and
         SWEEP's work (See notes on publicity later.)</p>
       <p>5. Engineering Accreditation Commission</p>
       <p>Don Baggert had reported concern with the process for selecting and
         training reviewers of software engineering programs. It appears that
         ABET considers the IEEE to be the lead entity for computer engineering
         and software engineering. (I missed the action item here someone was
         going to talk to Schwartz about something.) (Action Item 3 4)</p>
       <p>6. Code of Ethics Poster</p>
       <p>The Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices Project (SEEPP)
         asked for comments on a publicity poster. SWECC agreed that the content
         was okay,, and the presentation could be improved by consulting with
         a graphics artist.<br>
                       <br>
   7. SWEBOK Project Report</p>
       <p>Robert Dupuis, Pierre Bourque., and Alain Abran reported progress of
         the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge Project (SWEBOK). The Guide
         to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge consists of ten Knowledge
         Areas (KAs). Eight of these have been completed, with the remaining two
         expected by July 23., 1999. This puts the Stoneman phase of the project
         about one month behind schedule.</p>
       <p>A few hundred reviewers have volunteered to review version 0.5 of the
         Guide. All of the KAs have enough reviewers, but some additional reviewers
         are still being sought to represent other points of view (e.g., standards
         communities). Once the review is complete and comments have been addressed
         version 0.7 will be published, probably in November.</p>
       <p>It was agreed that SWECC should take advantage of the publication of
         version 0.7 of the Guide by announcing its availability (Action Items
         3 5 and 3 6). This will ensure widespread review and may help increase
         publicity about the efforts of SWECC.</p>
       <p>8. Related Activities</p>
       <p>It was noted that besides the Texas Board of Professional Engineers,,
         other groups (especially in Canada) have been taking actions about licensing
         software engineers. It was agreed that SWECC needs to enter into a formal
         agreement for the exchange of material between SWECC and each of these
         other groups (Action Item 3 7).</p>
       <p>9. Performance Norms</p>
       <p>We discussed the creation of performance norms for software engineering.
         This activity would identify skills and knowledge needed by software
         professionals. Volunteers from industry and academia would participate
         in these definitions. It is likely that a proposal for a SWECC endorsed
         project to define performance norms will be proposed soon.</p>
       <p>10. Guidelines for Projects and Proposals</p>
       <p>Dennis Frailey presented a set of guidelines for projects and proposals
         for new projects. (See attachment 1) The guidelines were approved as
         a SWECC policy. They become effective July 13.,1999, and they will be
         reviewed June 30, 2001.</p>
       <p>11. Proposal for a Database of Software Engineering Programs<br>
           <br>
   We reviewed a proposal for an annual survey of international software engineering
   programs. (See attachment 2) The proposal was endorsed, subject to three conditions:<br>
   1. The project should define their criteria for including software engineering
   programs in the categories they track. (E.g., Is a master degree program included
   if it contains only one course in software engineering Are master degree programs
   included only if they have the title &quot;Software Engineering&quot; )<br>
   2. The project should describe how they intend to collect information from
   non North American programs.<br>
   3. The project should identify representatives who will report to CS and SIGSOFT.
   Dennis Frailey will communicate with the project proposers on the status of
   their proposal (Action Item 3 8).</p>
       <p>12. FY2000 Budget</p>
       <p>The FY2000 budget was approved as originally presented.</p>
       <p>13. Process Assessment</p>
       <p>We discussed the relationship between the Capability Maturity Model
         (CMM) of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and the process component
         of SWEBOK. Although there is no direct connection between the two, it
         is desirable to beverage the understanding of the software engineering
         process that each represents. Leonard Tripp will talk to Steve Cross
         about this relationship (Action Item 3 9). One possible interaction might
         be to include someone from the SEI as a reviewer of SWEBOK under the
         category of standards setting bodies.</p>
       <p>14. Ironman Phase of SWEBOK</p>
       <p>Pierre Bourque and Alain Abran presented the plans for the Ironman phase
         of the SWEBOK project. Much of this effort will be collecting and analyzing
         feedback from the Stoneman version of the Guide to Software Engineering
         Knowledge. The Guide will then be updated.</p>
       <p>The SWEBOK team was asked if they would be interested in managing a
         performance norms project in parallel with the Ironman phase. They expressed
         interest., but asked to have more time to consider the commitment of
         resources.</p>
       <p>We discussed possible funding of Ironman. The current Industrial Advisory
         Board would be asked it they wished to continue their sponsorship, and
         some new members would be sought.<br>
                       <br>
   Publication of the Stoneman version of the Guide will make it possible for
   authors to publish tutorials on its contents. We noted that short presentations
   of the Guide might be given by any member of SWECC, but longer presentations
   (e.g., half day tutorials) would require too much preparation. Tutorials and
   presentations would help increase awareness of SWEBOK within the software engineering
   community. We should look for opportunities to give such presentations.</p>
       <p>15. Future Plans</p>
       <p>Publicity for SWECC and its projects was discussed. One way to generate
         publicity would be to present the Stoneman Guide to the Body of Knowledge
         at conferences we attend. For example, the Software Technology Conference
         (STC) is attended by a large portion of the defense software industry.
         We might be able to arrange a session or multiple sessions on SWEBOK
         there. Other possible venues are ICSE in Ireland in 2000, FIE for educators,
         and the annual SEI meeting. Mark Ardis agreed to coordinate a list of
         conferences that SWECC members will attend (Action Item 3 10), so that
         we can take advantage of opportunities to present SWEBOK.</p>
       <p>SWECC will meet again in late January 2000. If there is enough business
         there will be an interim teleconference meeting in October 1999.</p>
