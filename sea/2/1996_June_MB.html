       </ul>
       <p><strong>1.0 Background</strong></p>
       <p>On May 21, 1993, the IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors approved
         a motion to establish a steering committee for evaluating, planning,
         and coordinating actions related to establishing software engineering
         as a profession. </p>
       <p>In August 1993 the ACM Council endorsed the establishment of a Commission
         on Software Engineering to address a number of questions relating to
         1) the terminology used to describe software engineering and those who
         work in the software area; 2) the identification of generally accepted
         and desired standards of good software practice; and 3) our ability to
         identify, educate, and train individuals who are competent with software
         engineering and design.</p>
       <p>An ad-hoc committee of the Computer Society, with participation of the
         ACM worked during the Fall of 1993, defining a process and initial recommendations
         to accomplish these tasks.</p>
       <p>In January 1993 the President of the Computer Society made a proposal
         to the President of the ACM to streamline the steering committee and
         to include equal numbers of members appointed by the society presidents.
         The ACM agreed to the proposal and we have been operating as a Joint
         Steering Committee.</p>
       <p><strong>2.0 Mission Statement</strong></p>
       <p>To establish the appropriate sets(s) of criteria and norms for professional
         practice of software engineering upon which industrial decisions, professional
         certification, and educational curricula can be based.</p>
       <p><strong>3.0 Initial Recommendations (November 1993)</strong></p>
       <ol>
         <li>Adopt Standard Definitions</li>
         <li>Define Required Body of Knowledge and Recommended Practices (in electrical
           engineering, for example, electromagnetic theory is part of the body
           of knowledge while the National Electrical Safety Code is a recommended
           practice.)</li>
         <li>Define Ethical Standards</li>
         <li>Define Educational Curricula for (a) undergraduate, (b) graduate
           (MS), and (c) continuing education (for retraining and migration).</li>
       </ol>
       <p><strong>4.0 Rationale and Approach</strong></p>
       <p>The recommendations have implied dependencies and should be implemented
         on the order suggested.</p>
       <p>To implement these recommendations we will establish and appoint working
         committees and task forces as necessary to accomplish the steering committee's
         work.</p>
       <p>Rational for recommendations suggested by definition of &quot;Profession&quot; [Webster's
         New Collegiate Dictionary]</p>
       <ul>
         <li> Profession: A calling requiring specialized knowledge and often
           long and intensive academic preparation; a principal calling, vocation
           or employment; the whole body of persons engaged in a calling.</li>
         <li>Professional: (1) Relating to or characteristic of a profession;
           engaged in one of the learned professions; characterized by or conforming
           to the technical or ethical standards of a profession. (2) participating
           for gain or livelihood in an activity or field of endeavor often engaged
           in by amateurs; engaged in by persons receiving financial returns.</li>
         <li> Professionalism: (1) The conduct aims or qualities that characterize
           or mark a profession or a professional person. (2) The following of
           a profession (as athletics) for gain or livelihood.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>As defined in IEEE Standard 610.12:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Software Engineering: (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined,
           quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance
           of software; that is, the application of engineering to software. (2)
           The study of approaches as is (1).</li>
       </ul>
       <p>This definition of software engineering focuses on acquisition and application
         of technical standards. It does not address the application of ethical
         standards. We covered this issue with a specific recommendation.</p>
       <p><strong>4.1 Revised Charter for Education Task Force (December 1995)</strong></p>
       <p>Refine the Body of Knowledge for educational purposes by:</p>
       <p>(a) Identifying critical prerequisite relationships within the body
         of knowledge</p>
       <p>(b) Identifying appropriate tutorial and reference material for learning
         the body of knowledge, in the process further refining the specification
         of the body of knowledge</p>
       <p>(c) identifying, as appropriate, levels of expertise in the practice
         and the corresponding coverage of the body of knowledge</p>
       <p>The basic charter is to identify ways of learning the body of knowledge</p>
       <p>It reserves to various educational institutions the definition of specific
         courses, degrees, or academic programs</p>
       <p>(a) The prerequisite structure should identify critical relationships,
         leaving as much flexibility as possible</p>
       <p>(b)The educational materials should adequately cover the body of knowledge,
         but is not necessarily a definitive set of references.</p>
       <p>(c) The levels of expertise are intended to correspond to levels of
         job responsibility, not to educational levels. Le., &quot;entry level&quot;, &quot;independent
         professional&quot; rather than &quot;BS&quot; or &quot;MS&quot;.</p>
       <p>There is a debate as to whether Software Engineering is a part of Computer
         Science or vice versa. We should not be distracted by this debate from
         the goal of meeting the needs of industry.</p>
       <p>The objective is to seek agreement on the curricula that should be taught
         and not necessarily on which departments teach it.</p>

         <li>Analysis and results planned by 4Q/96</li>
         <li>Improvements and wider distribution TBD</li>
       </ul>
       <p>The required body of knowledge and recommended practices are not static

       </ul>
       <p>Multiple vehicles for conducting survey</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Intent is to be as inclusive as possible - we are baselining the
           body of knowledge; we need to reach as many individuals and areas of
           application as possible</li>
         <li>Survey questions are complex and there are many topics/questions
           - Respondent will get subsets of questions to reduce burden</li>
