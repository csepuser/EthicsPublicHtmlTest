                       <strong>Code of Ethics Implementation / Training</strong></p>
       <p align="justify"><br>
   I recommend the following steps toward implementation, and to help overcome
     the problems above.<br>
                       <br>
   0.0.1. Management Support<br>
   Wayne provides an &quot;preamble&quot; to the code of ethics, citing the business
   reasons for its adoption, and his expectation that everyone will conduct their
   affairs in accordance with same. I have attached a 'beginning' of a draft memo.</p>
       <p align="justify"><br>
   0.0.2. Principles Summary. We publish a summary of the 8 principles in the
     code of ethics, and provide this as a laminated book mark or page with some
     graphical content. The detailed code is published as a small booklet and
     is also published on SPIN.</p>
       <p align="justify"><br>
   0.0.3. Training. We prepare a &quot;meeting in a box&quot; for each manager,
   and conduct a &quot;train the trainer&quot; session for them.<br>
   Staff training is 8 sessions (1 per principle), each lasting 10 minutes. The
   code is distributed at the first session.<br>
   Each session includes a case on the principle for the group to discuss, using
   the detailed points behind the principle. This could take several months to
   complete, but the time commitment is modest.<br>
   We will ask each manager to renew this training annually, to include new people
   and with fresh cases.<br>
   (This will be developed through pilot sessions to test how workable this is
   and gain buy in.) </p>
       <p align="center"><br>
           <strong><br>
   Ethical Principles Training<br>
   Module 1 - Product<br>
   Case</strong></p>
       <p align="justify"><br>
   Alicia is responsible for our agency relations with respect to agency download.
     This is the system that updates agents' files via electronic transmissions.
     On occasion, the system has an error, and erroneous data is downloaded. The
     business area generally does not notify agents of problems. Their rationale
     is generally that it is a minor problem, and the agents will not notice.<br>
   Alicia is concerned because this system has the responsibility for updating
   agency files directly, without the agent's approval or knowledge. Alicia regularly
   disagrees as to the severity of the problem, and feels that we should notify
   the agency in many more cases.<br>
   Alicia has raised this problem to the customer with the direct responsibility
   for agency support, and she has been told that this is not an IT problem or
   responsibility, and that she should not raise it again. <br>
   She has also discussed it with her management, and the manager informed her
   that &quot;the customer is always right -- let it go&quot;.<br>
   Should Alicia continue to raise this as a problem? To whom?<br>
   Guidelines Reference<br>
   Ask the group to review the implications in the code of ethics under &quot;Product&quot;,
   and decide which ones apply. Ask the group what they would do in this circumstance.<br>
   Discussion Guide<br>
   If the group needs additional insight, refer to the following discussion.<br>
   The problem is a conflict between how Alicia regards data integrity, and that
   of her business partner or customer. Alicia feels a responsibility for the
   integrity of the information within her charge. All errors are errors, and
   the end user of the information should be able to make an informed decision
   regarding the possible impact. The business partner feels comfortable making
   this decision on behalf of the agents, thus minimizing time and expense spent
   on problems that have little impact.<br>
   Consequences of the current state might be that if an agent were to discover
   these errors, even though they are not consequential, they raise the specter
   of more significant problems that have not been disclosed. It would be something
   like finding a one cent error in your checkbook. If a particular problem does
   have material consequences, it would also be difficult to explain why the agency
   was not informed.<br>
   Alicia should examine possible alternatives toward resolving this conflict.<br>
   She can clearly raise it to her manager at the next level up. She should also
   always feel comfortable raising it to any other manager in the company. <br>
   Ultimately, she wants to make it clear to the business partner that there is
   a fiduciary responsibility for an IT professional. She needs to feel comfortable
   that the company is aware of possible consequences if these problems are discovered
   by the agents.</p>
       <p align="justify">She might suggest an objective means for determining
         the impact on the agents, such as to consult with one or two informed
         agents as to their opinion on the problem.<br>
   The ultimate solution might be full disclosure to the agents, with an explanation
   of the types of problems that are normally encountered. <br>
   Sometimes an analogy with other practices is also helpful. This is a policy
   not unlike that practiced by hardware and software vendors. It is a matter
   of common knowledge that problems occur in their products, but most problems
   have very minor impact. The vendor does not feel compelled to explain every
   problem to every customer. However, if a customer experiences a more serious
   impact, then the vendor will assist in correcting the problem. The vendor also
   provides documentation on all problems which can be referenced by the customer
   directly, or through a call to a service desk.</p>
