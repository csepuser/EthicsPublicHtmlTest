       <p>Dear SEEPP Volunteer:
       <p> I thank you for your interest in this important effort of the joint
         IEEE-CS/ACM Steering committee and the working group of professional
         competence. The work of our task force has been slow to start due to
         some of our unfamiliarity with this process. I do sincerely apologize
         for the delay in getting this working group started.</p>
       <p> I hope you continue to be interested in this important effort. We are
         all volunteers in this effort and there was some delay in determining
         how we should proceed. As you know, the IEEE-CS/ACM joint steering committee
         on establishing software engineering as a profession divided the work
         into three major task forces: one defining the current minimal skill
         set required to be a software engineer, another defining how to educate
         people with these skills and keep them current in new and developing
         technologies. These two task forces are well underway. The third task
         force is on software engineering ethics and professional practices(SEEPP).
         The goals of the third task force are to establish standards of professional
         practice for applying these skills and to determine and model minimal
         levels of ethical commitment in the utilization of these skills.</p>
       <p> The task of developing professional practices and standards is new
         to most of us. The SEEPP task force has divided our task up into several
         sub-tasks each of which is assigned to a working group. ( A good computer
         problem solving technique.) A problem that has caused some of the delay
         is the question of how to manage and organize the working group process.
         I have a plan.</p>
       <p> I would like our working group to proceed initially in the following
         way. We do know that other organizations and professions have developed
         standards of practice. These standards vary in numerous ways. Some standards
         of practice are codified and become black letter law for anyone who is
         practicing a profession, while other standards of practice are primarily
         guidelines that help one to make decisions in difficult situations. I
         believe that our standards of practice should probably be a combination
         of both; providing some solid unequivocal minimal standards of practice
         and also provide some guidelines and principles for resolving ethical
         issues that arise in the practice of the profession. Thess guidelines
         are needed to help address new or unanticipated situations created by
         our changing technology and evolving environments.</p>
       <p> In determining how to proceed, there are formal procedural guidelines
         used by the IEEE for the functioning of working groups. I have appended
         a preliminary draft of a version of those guidelines which we are modifying
         for the SEEP task force. Although these address several logistical matters,
         they do not provide a technique for approaching the process. I would
         like to initiate the work of this group in the following way.</p>
       <p> First, I have set up an small email list for the members of the professional
         competence working group at East Tennessee State- ProfComp @ ETSU-east_tenn-st.edu.
         Our group can use this list to circulate all correspondence to each member
         of the group. I will put together a list of the current members and I
         will circulate it to all members of the group two weeks after this letter
         has been sent. If you do not want you name circulated on this list please
         contact me before March 5. The names on this list will not be circulated
         to any other organization nor will it be made available by me to any
         other group Anything mailed to the list will only be circulated to members
         of the working group. The list will be moderated by me to eliminate spamming
         and other irrelevant activities. . Second, I propose the following general
         outline for the development of our standards in professional competence.
         A. We need to determine the content and structure for our document. Some
         general standards are contained in the appended procedures. But we need
         to be more specific. To this end we need to gather and distribute other
         profession's standards of practice. These need to be distributed to and
         digested by each of us. INFORMATION GATHERING: Please send to the LIST: </p>
       <p>1. names and addresses of organizations that you know have standards
         of professional practices. </p>
       <p>2. your willingness to get copies of these standards (preferably electronic)
         for the list.</p>
       <p> 3. your willingness to write a short abstract of that standard, indicating
         the scope of application of the standard, means they use to update it,
         how practitioners are educated about that standard, and the methods of
         standards enforcement, if any. ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS: Given this information
         we should be able to abstract a model of professional practices for our
         use. We can also use these documents, along with our knowledge of the
         nature of the software engineering profession to formulate a statement
         of scope ( i.e., what it is we think we should be doing) and a structure
         in which to organize our suggestions and conclusions. A Scope addresses
         the kinds of things we want to include in our standards and it clearly
         states who is(are) the intended audience(s) for the standard (practitioners,
         educators, professional society officials...)</p>
       <p> B. Once the model is clearly stated we can further subdivide the problem
         based on the model and ask for volunteers to write rough first drafts
         of various sections of the document. These first drafts can then be circulated
         and modified, deleted from, added to, altered, etc. The procedure I have
         in mind is that all drafts, documents, suggestions for items to include
         or exclude will be circulated to the entire working group (an electronic
         meeting)</p>
       <p> C. We can then revisit questions of format and content and develop
         a single consistent document which we can present the SEEPP task force.</p>
       <p> D. For the present our meetings will merely be electronic. As we progress,
         there are some national meeting that several of us will be at and we
         can gather in subgroups at those meetings. If it is the consensus of
         the group that we need to all discuss something together we can arrange
         a conference call. (These are hard to organize and expensive, so they
         should be minimized.)</p>
       <p> This procedure is written in Jello. Any suggestions on this process
         will be gratefully accepted. Please send an email 'Hi' to me at ProfComp,
         so that I know this message was received and that the list is working.</p>
       <p> We are underway ! Please refer to item A. above.</p>
       <p> Hoping for a productive relationship and grateful for your interest,</p>
       <p> don gotterbarn</p>

         be developed in a manner consistent with the policies and procedures
         that govern the development official IEEE Standards.</p>
       <p>The SEEPP TF has been jointly established on behalf of the IEEE Computer
         Society (IEEE-CS) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
         This document attempts to distill the relevant IEEE Standards policies,
         procedures and practices applicable to this joint entity.</p>
       <p>This guide is derived from the IEEE and IEEE-CS Standards documents
         listed below in clause 2. Differences between this document and the official
         IEEE and IEEE-CS documents reflect the SEEPP TF's unique environmental

       <p>-ii- 1. Overview</p>
       <p>This guide discusses how to manage the development of draft IEEE- CS/ACM
         standards for software engineering ethical and professional practices.
         While these draft standards are not being formulated under the auspices
         of a formal IEEE Standards Project Authorization Request (commonly known
         as a &quot;PAR&quot;), these standards documents are to be developed
         in accordance with appropriate IEEE and Computer Society Standard's Policies
         and Procedures.</p>
       <p>The IEEE standards development process includes two volunteer groups:
         a Sponsor such as the SEEPP task force, who supervises all phases of
         the development of a standard, and a standards developing committee such
         as a Working Group (WG), which is responsible to the Sponsor, and which
         develops the draft standard. A SEEPP draft standard will be forwarded
         to the IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors and the ACM Council for
         action once it has met IEEE balloting approval criteria (see below).</p>
       <p> 1.1 Scope</p>
       <p>This guide is intended for use by the SEEPP task force, its WG Chairpersons
         and members.</p>

         it is ambiguous or inconsistent, the following documents will have precedent,
         with higher precedence indicated by earlier appearance on the following
         list):</p>

       <p>IEEE Standards include but are not limited to</p>
       <p> -- Standards: documents with mandatory requirements. (Mandatory requirements
         are generally characterized by use of the verb &quot;shall.&quot;) --
         Recommended practices: documents in which procedures and positions preferred
         by the IEEE are presented. (Recommended practices normally use the verb &quot;should.&quot;)
         -- Guides: documents in which alternative approaches to good practice
         are suggested but no clear-cut recommendations are made. -- Trial-use
         documents: publications that are effective for not more than two years.
         They can be any of the categories of standards publications listed above.</p>
       <p>IEEE Standards are signified by the use of the upper-case &quot;S&quot; in
         the word &quot;Standards.&quot; (IEEE Standards activities operate under
         the umbrella of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as one
         of several accredited standards developing organizations. ANSI is a member
         entity of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).)</p>

       <p>The draft standards developed by the SEEPP WG's are signified by the
         using the lower-case &quot;s&quot; in the word &quot;standard,&quot; whenever
         grammatically permitted. This convention shall be followed to distinguish
         SEEPP standards from approved IEEE Standards.</p>

       <p>The independent use of the word &quot;standard,&quot; or its plural
         (i.e., without a leading 'IEEE' or 'IEEE-CS/ACM SEEPP') may be used generically
         in reference to standards, recommended practices, and guide documents,
         based on context. This is consistent with IEEE Standards practice and
         this guide's definition 3.1.</p>

       <p> 4. Working Groups</p>
       <p>Working groups (WGs) exist to organize the technical development of
         a draft standard.</p>
       <p>4.1 Management &amp; operation</p>
       <p>4.1.1 Meetings</p>
       <p>Working group meetings shall be held in a manner and with a frequency
         appropriate to facilitate the expeditious delivery of a draft standard
         appropriate for delivery to the IEEE-CS BoG and ACM Council. Meetings
         may be conducted in person, by IT-facilitate methods (e.g., e-mail),
         or in combination. Meeting dates, times, methods (technology), locations
         and frequency shall be determined by the WG Chairperson.</p>
       <p> -3- 4.1.2 Quorum &Otilde;IEEE-CS SAB P&amp;Ps&thorn;</p>
       <p>The default quorum for WGs shall be one-half (50%) of the voting membership. &Otilde;However,
         see the discussion of quorum in RROO.&thorn;</p>
       <p>4.1.3 Voting/consensus</p>
       <p>During the draft standard development cycle, WG Chairs have the discretion
         to use as expeditious a method as needed to establish the WG membership's
         consensus on any issue. In extreme cases, a formal vote of the WG membership
         may be necessary. Robert's Rules of Order (RROO) should be invoked to
         govern any fractious debate or vote.</p>
       <p>4.1.4 The first draft</p>
       <p>After establishing a draft Scope, (see clause 4.1.4.1.), the WG should
         outline the important issues and sub-topics it thinks the standard should
         address (see clause 4.1.4.2). The WG should also establish the nature
         of the standard it is to develop (i.e., standard, recommend practice,
         guide, etc., see 4.1.4.3).</p>
       <p>Although it does not have to be included in the text of the standard,
         the WG should clearly and concisely define the purpose of the document.
         This generally describes &quot;why&quot; the document is being developed.
         For example:</p>
       <p> &quot;Purpose: Full-range current limiting fuses are not currently
         covered by standards. In fulfilling this need, the working group will
         also define and recommend an overall action plan to clarify and improve
         industry understanding for all types of fuses.&quot;</p>
       <p>The WG Chairperson should then identify an individual to author an initial
         draft. The author should be permitted to prepare the draft with or without
         additional input or assistance from any other WG members, at his or her
         discretion. The consensus of the WG membership should then be evaluated
         to determine if the completed draft can subsequently serve as the foundation
         for an iterative process of refinement.</p>
       <p>4.1.4.1 Scope</p>
       <p>The WG must clearly and concisely define the scope of the document.
         The scope generally describes &quot;what&quot; will be affected, i.e.,
         the technical boundaries of the document. For example:</p>
       <p> &quot;Scope: Communications equipment that is to operate in electric
         power generating stations and in generation, transmission, and distribution
         substations.&quot;</p>
       <p> &quot;Scope: Interface systems used to interconnect both programmable
         and nonprogrammable electronic measuring apparatus with other apparatus
         and accessories necessary -4- to assemble instrumentation systems.&quot;</p>
       <p> &quot;Scope: Peer-review panels or committees used to assess a Software
         Engineer's, or a Software Engineering Organization's conduct with respect
         to avoiding or resolving ethical conflicts.&quot;</p>
       <p>4.1.4.2 Outline &Otilde;IEEE Guide to Standards Development&thorn;</p>
       <p>The outline should be consistent with the requirements of the IEEE Standards
         Style Manual (see clause 5. in this guide).</p>
       <p>Two outline styles are used for standards. Each WG should be aware of
         the advantages and disadvantages of both styles.</p>
       <p>1) The first is that of the standard that states only requirements.
         This type of standard may then be followed by a guide, which provides
         guidance, examples, tutorial material, etc. The advantage of this approach
         is that it permits the scope of each effort to be restricted to a finite
         task, allowing each effort to be completed relatively quickly. 2) The
         second is the standard that incorporates guidance or tutorial material
         or both, in addition to requirements. This has the advantage of adding
         clarity to the standard. The disadvantage of this approach is that it
         may preclude the standard from being completed in a timely manner. Due
         to the amount of material being reviewed, it may take so long from the
         start of the project to its conclusion that all concerned may loose interest
         and leave.</p>
       <p>4.1.4.3 Appropriate title</p>
       <p>A title should include the type of document. For example:</p>
       <p>a) *Standard* Policies and Procedures for Establishing and Operating
         an Ethics Peer-review Panel for Software Engineering Activities. b) *Recommended
         Practices* for Resolving Ethical Conflict ...</p>
       <p>The title should not contain the words &quot;IEEE&quot; or &quot;ACM.&quot;</p>
       <p>4.1.5 Resolving changes</p>
       <p>The WG may use the methodology discussed in clause 4.3.6, below.</p>
       <p>4.2 WG Membership</p>
       <p>4.2.1 Requirements</p>
       <p>The default requirement for WG membership is a direct and material interest
         and willingness to participate in the activities of the WG, and attendance
         of at least two (2) out of last three (3) regularly-scheduled WG meetings,
         except in the case of newly- -5- formed WGs, for which voting privileges
         shall accrue to all eligible attendees at the initial meeting.</p>
       <p>WG members shall participate in a manner consistent with their professional
         expert opinion as individuals, or as an organizational representative,
         but not both.</p>
       <p>4.2.2 Expiration/Revocation &Otilde;IEEE-CS SAB P&amp;P's&thorn;</p>
       <p>Membership for WG members (other than Officers) shall by default expire
         upon the third (3rd) consecutive regularly-scheduled meeting of the WG
         not attended by the member, unless there is good cause for an absence.</p>
       <p>&Otilde;A notice should be sent by the WG Chair to the member whose
         membership status is at risk thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting
         at which the membership would expire.&thorn;</p>
       <p>Membership shall be revoked upon the second consecutive WG ballot not
         returned in advance of the deadline, provided however that a warning
         notice to that effect was sent to the member, whose membership is subject
         to revocation, a minimum of thirty (30) days in advance of the deadline
         of the second WG ballot.</p>
       <p>4.2.3 Elections of Chairs and Vice-Chairs &Otilde;IEEE-CS SAB P&amp;P's&thorn;</p>
       <p>WG Chairs and Vice-Chairs shall be elected by the WG and confirmed by
         the SEEPP TF. The default and maximum term for Chair and Vice- Chair
         is two (2) years.</p>
       <p>Initial appointments, and temporary appointments to fill vacancies due
         to resignations or removals may be made by the Co-Chairs of the SEEPP
         TF, and shall be valid for no longer than six (6) months.</p>
       <p>Chairs and Vice-Chairs may be re-elected up to four (4) times.</p>
       <p>4.2.3.1 Removal of Chairs or Vice-Chairs &Otilde;IEEE-CS SAB P&amp;P's&thorn;</p>
       <p>The SEEPP TF may remove the Chair or Vice-Chair of a WG for cause.</p>
       <p>The Co-Chairs of the SEEPP TF shall give the individual subject to removal
         a minimum of thirty (30) days written mail notice, with proof of delivery,
         of a meeting of the SEEPP TF at which the removal is to be decided. Such
         notice shall include the specific reasons for the proposed removal. The
         individual subject to removal shall have the opportunity to confront
         the evidence for removal, and to argue in his or her behalf.</p>
       <p>In the clear and documented case of gross misconduct, the Chair of the
         SEEPP TF may suspend the Chair of the WG, with the concurrence of the
         Chair of the Joint IEEE Computer Society/ACM Steering Committee for Establishing
         Software Engineering as a</p>
       <p> -6- Profession. A meeting or teleconference of the SEEPP TF shall be
         convened as soon as practical, but in no case later than thirty (30)
         days, to review the suspension as provided for above.</p>
       <p>4.3 Balloting</p>
       <p>Balloting shall provide for the development of consensus by all interests
         significantly affected by the scope of the standard. This is achieved
         by establishing a balloting group (or body) membership that balances
         such interests. Balance is defined as the avoidance of dominance by any
         single interest category &Otilde;IEEE Standards Operations Manual, 5.4.1&thorn;</p>
       <p>The balloting body is composed of WG voting members and all other appropriate
         individuals and organizational representatives.</p>
       <p>4.3.1 Process</p>
       <p>The balloting process consists of the following steps:</p>
       <p>Step responsible oversight ------------------------------- -----------
         ------------ </p>
       <p>(1) Approval to ballot WG SEEPP TF </p>
       <p>(2) Invitation to ballot issued SEEPP TF N/A</p>
       <p> (3) Creation of balloting body SEEPP TF N/A </p>
       <p>(4) Ballot SEEPP TF N/A</p>
       <p> (5) Ballot resolution WG SEEPP TF </p>
       <p>(6) Approval to forward to CS BoG/ACM Council WG/SEEPP TF JtStr</p>
       <p>4.3.2 Balloting Body</p>
       <p>The WG Chair or Vice-Chair shall request that the SEEPP task force form
         a balloting body for the purpose of conducting the ballot.</p>
       <p>The balloting body for a standard is comprised of all individuals or
         organizational representatives (OR) who have expressed a direct and material
         interest in the scope of the proposed standard.</p>
       <p>Those returning a request to the SEEPP TF to be included in the balloting
         body should indicate their interest category (see 4.3.4), and their agreement
         to return the ballot form and their comments within ten (10) days of
         receipt of the ballot.</p>
       <p>The SEEPP TF Co-chairs' are responsible for ensuring that the balloting
         body meets the requirements of balance at the time the balloting body
         is formed, as described in 4.3.3 or in the IEEE Standards Operations
         Manual, and that there is no attempt to dominate the ballot by a special
         interest group.</p>
       <p>4.3.3 Balance</p>
       <p>The standard's balloting body shall be balanced by classifying the</p>
       <p> -7- relationship of each member of the balloting body relative to the
         scope of the target standard. Standards balloting bodies shall consist
         of no more than one-half (50%) of participants from any category except &quot;general.&quot; Organizational
         representatives may elect to ballot as the OR, or as an individual, but
         not both.</p>
       <p>4.3.4 Interest categories</p>
       <p>Balloting interest categories shall be established by the WG relative
         to a standard's scope. The SEEPP TF shall approve the balloting interest
         categories prior to issuing a invitation to ballot. By default, the following
         interest categories will be used: individual professional, academic,
         organizational representative, or end user/general interest.</p>
       <p>4.3.5 The ballot &Otilde;1993 IEEE Standards Operations Manual, 5.4.3.1&thorn;</p>
       <p>The ballot shall provide three choices:</p>
       <p>a) Approve (Affirmative): This vote may be accompanied by comments suggesting
         corrections and improvements. Action on such comments is left to the
         discretion of the SEEPP task force. b) Do Not Approve (Negative): This
         vote shall be accompanied by specific reasons in sufficient detail so
         that the specific wording of the changes that will cause the negative
         voter to change his or her vote to &quot;approve&quot; can be readily
         be determined. If the changes are made, then the vote automatically becomes
         affirmative. In the absence of reasons for a negative vote, the ballot
         shall, after a follow-up inquiry, be classified as &quot;no response.&quot; c)
         Abstain: This category is provided to allow for ballot returns from members
         who do not wish to review documents because of conflict of interest,
         lack of expertise, or other reasons. A reason shall be given for this
         vote; otherwise, the ballot shall be classified as &quot;no response.&quot;</p>
       <p>For a standards ballot to be effective, at least 75% of the ballots
         shall be returned. In the event that the 75% return from the balloting
         group cannot be obtained, the balloting process is considered to have
         failed. Further disposition of the document shall be the responsibility
         of the SEEPP TF. A minimum of 75% of those voting affirmative or negative
         must approve the draft in order to submit the draft to the IEEE-CS BoG
         and the ACM Council. In the event that 30% or more of the ballots are
         abstentions, the ballot shall be considered invalid.</p>
       <p>The SEEPP TF is only obligated to consider ballots that are received
         by the close of the ballot. The ballot shall close at the end of business
         on the date specified on the ballot or when a 75% return of the balloting
         group is received. This extension for receipt of a 75% return shall be
         no longer than 60 days. -8- 4.3.6 Resolution of comments, objections,
         and negative votes &Otilde;1993 IEEE Standards Operations Manual, 5.4.3.2&thorn;</p>
       <p>The SEEPP TF shall review all ballots received and shall make every
         attempt to resolve comments, objections, and negative votes favorably.
         Comments pointing out obvious mistakes, typographical errors, and improvements
         in punctuation, grammar, and composition, which do not change the technical
         meaning, may be accepted, revised, or rejected. &Otilde;It must be borne
         in mind that documents are professionally edited prior to &Otilde;final&thorn; publication.&thorn;</p>
       <p>Comments accompanying affirmative votes that advocate changes in the
         technical meaning of the document may be accepted, revised, or rejected.</p>
       <p>Changes may be made in the document to resolve negative votes or for
         other reasons. If the negative vote is not satisfied, either entirely
         or in part, the negative voter shall be informed of the reasons for the
         rejection and be given an opportunity either to change his or her vote
         to &quot;approve&quot; or to retain his or her negative vote.</p>
       <p>All substantive technical changes made in the final draft to resolve
         comments, objections, and negative votes, and all unresolved negative
         votes, together with the reasons of the negative voter and the rebuttal
         by the WG members conducting the resolution of the ballots, shall be
         submitted to the balloting group, providing each member an opportunity
         to change his or her ballot. Names of the unresolved negative balloters
         are to be included with their negative comments in the recirculation
         of negative comments. Further resolution efforts may be required if additional
         negative votes result.</p>
       <p>Proposed draft standards receiving a significant number of unresolved
         negative votes should be considered by the SEEPP TF for trial-use (see
         IEEE Standards Operations Manual, clause 5.7)</p>
       <p> 5. Style</p>
       <p>The IEEE Standards Style Manual is the definitive source for guidance
         in formatting draft standards documents. The Style Manual also describes
         the optional and required contents of the drafts. Additionally, as the
         Style Guide notes in its introduction:</p>
       <p> &quot;In some cases, it is necessary and appropriate to accommodate
         special requirements. Standards developers should keep in mind that flexibility
         is allowed, and that IEEE Standards Project Editors are available to
         assist working groups in designing drafts that will suite their particular
         requirements.&quot;</p>
       <p> -9- Of particular interest to the SEEPP TF working groups will be the
         Style Manual's clauses 5 and 6: &quot;Content of drafts,&quot; and &quot;General
         style,&quot; respectively.</p>
       <p>Generally, standards documents are divided into four or more clauses,
         as follows:</p>
       <p> Clause Title/subject ------ ------------------------------------------ </p>
       <p>1. Introduction </p>
       <p>2. Scope </p>
       <p>3. Definitions </p>
       <p>4. Main text of the standard</p>
       <p> 4+n Additional text of the standard (optional)</p>
