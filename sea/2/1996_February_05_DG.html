       <p align="center"><strong>5th Feb 1996: Redesigned PW Foster from the Centre
           for Computing and Social Responsibility</strong></p>
       <p align="center"><strong>Preamble</strong></p>
       <p>Commitment to ethical professional conduct is expected of every member
         (voting members, associate members, and student members) of the Association
         for Computing Machinery (ACM).</p>
       <p>This Code, consisting of 24 imperatives formulated as statements of
         personal responsibility, identifies the elements of such a commitment.
         It contains many, but not all, issues professionals are likely to face.
         Section 1outlines fundamental ethical considerations, while Section 2
         addresses additional, more specific considerations of professional conduct.
         Statements in Section 3 pertain more specifically to individuals who
         have a leadership role, whether in the workplace or in a volunteer capacity
         such as with organizations like ACM. Principles involving compliance
         with this Code are given in Section 4.</p>
       <p> The Code shall be supplemented by a set of Guidelines, which provide
         explanation to assist members in dealing with the various issues contained
         in the Code. It is expected that the Guidelines will be changed more
         frequently than the Code.</p>
       <p>The Code and its supplemented Guidelines are intended to serve as a
         basis for ethical decision making in the conduct of professional work.
         Secondarily, they may serve as a basis for judging the merit of a formal
         complaint pertaining to violation of professional ethical standards.</p>
       <p> It should be noted that although computing is not mentioned in the
         imperatives of Section 1, the Code is concerned with how these fundamental
         imperatives apply to one's conduct as a computing professional. These
         imperatives are expressed in a general form to emphasize that ethical
         principles which apply to computer ethics are derived from more general
         ethical principles.</p>
       <p> It is understood that some words and phrases in a code of ethics are
         subject to varying interpretations, and that any ethical principle may
         conflict with other ethical principles in specific situations. Questions
         related to ethical conflicts can best be answered by thoughtful consideration
         of fundamental principles, rather than reliance on detailed regulations.</p>

       <p align="center"><strong>MORE SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p>
       <p align="center"><strong>ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP IMPERATIVES</strong></p>
       <p align="center"><strong>COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE</strong></p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p><strong>1. GENERAL MORAL IMPERATIVES.</strong></p>
       <p>As an ACM member I will ....</p>
       <p>1.1 Contribute to society and human well?being.</p>
       <p> This principle concerning the quality of life of all people affirms
         an obligation to protect fundamental human rights and to respect the
         diversity of all cultures. An essential aim of computing professionals
         is to minimize negative consequences of computing systems, including
         threats to health and safety. When designing or implementing systems,
         computing professionals must attempt to ensure that the products of their
         efforts will be used in socially responsible ways, will meet social needs,
         and will avoid harmful effects to health and welfare.</p>
       <p> In addition to a safe social environment, human well?being includes
         a safe natural environment. Therefore, computing professionals who design
         and develop systems must be alert to, and make others aware of, any potential
         damage to the local or global environment. </p>
       <p>1.2 Avoid harm to others.</p>
       <p>&quot;Harm&quot; means injury or negative consequences, such as undesirable
         loss of information, loss of property, property damage, or unwanted environmental
         impacts. This principle prohibits use of computing technology in ways
         that result in harm to any of the following: users, the general public,
         employees, employers. Harmful actions include intentional destruction
         or modification of files and programs leading to serious loss of resources
         or unnecessary expenditure of human resources such as the time and effort
         required to purge systems of &quot;computer viruses.&quot;</p>
       <p>Well?intended actions, including those that accomplish assigned duties,
         may lead to harm unexpectedly. In such an event the responsible person
         or persons are obligated to undo or mitigate the negative consequences
         as much as possible. One way to avoid unintentional harm is to carefully
         consider potential impacts on all those affected by decisions made during
         design and implementation.</p>
       <p> To minimize the possibility of indirectly harming others, computing
         professionals must minimize malfunctions by following generally accepted
         standards for system design and testing. Furthermore, it is often necessary
         to assess the social consequences of systems to project the likelihood
         of any serious harm to others. If system features are misrepresented
         to users, coworkers, or supervisors, the individual computing professional
         is responsible for any resulting injury.</p>
       <p> In the work environment the computing professional has the additional
         obligation to report any signs of system dangers that might result in
         serious personal or social damage. If one's superiors do not act to curtail
         or mitigate such dangers, it may be necessary to &quot;blow the whistle&quot; to
         help correct the problem or reduce the risk. However, capricious or misguided
         reporting of violations can, itself, be harmful. Before reporting violations,
         all relevant aspects of the incident must be thoroughly assessed. In
         particular, the assessment of risk and responsibility must be credible.
         It is suggested that advice be sought from other computing professionals.
         See regarding thorough evaluations. </p>
       <p>1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.</p>
       <p> Honesty is an essential component of trust. Without trust an organization
         cannot function effectively. The honest computing professional will not
         make deliberately false or deceptive claims about a system or system
         design, but will instead provide full disclosure of all pertinent system
         limitations and problems.</p>
       <p>A computer professional has a duty to be honest about his or her own
         qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts
         of interest.</p>
       <p> Membership in volunteer organizations such as ACM may at times place
         individuals in situations where their statements or actions could be
         interpreted as carrying the &quot;weight&quot; of a larger group of professionals.
         An ACM member will exercise care to not misrepresent ACM or positions
         and policies of ACM or any ACM units.</p>
       <p>1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.</p>
       <p> The values of equality, tolerance, respect for others, and the principles
         of equal justice govern this imperative. Discrimination on the basis
         of race, sex, religion, age, disability, national origin, or other such
         factors is an explicit violation of ACM policy and will not be tolerated.</p>
       <p>Inequities between different groups of people may result from the use
         or misuse of information and technology. In a fair society,all individuals
         would have equal opportunity to participate in, or benefit from, the
         use of computer resources regardless of race, sex, religion, age, disability,
         national origin or other such similar factors. However, these ideals
         do not justify unauthorized use of computer resources nor do they provide
         an adequate basis for violation of any other ethical imperatives of this
         code.</p>
       <p>1.5 Honor property rights including copyrights and patent.</p>
       <p>Violation of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and the terms of license
         agreements is prohibited by law in most circumstances. Even when software
         is not so protected, such violations are contrary to professional behavior.
         Copies of software should be made only with proper authorization. Unauthorized
         duplication of materials must not be condoned.</p>
       <p>1.6 Give proper credit for intellectual property.</p>
       <p> Computing professionals are obligated to protect the integrity of intellectual
         property. Specifically, one must not take credit for other's ideas or
         work, even in cases where the work has not been explicitly protected
         by copyright, patent, etc.</p>
       <p>1.7 Respect the privacy of others.</p>
       <p> Computing and communication technology enables the collection and exchange
         of personal information on a scale unprecedented in the history of civilization.
         Thus there is increased potential for violating the privacy of individuals
         and groups. It is the responsibility of professionals to maintain the
         privacy and integrity of data describing individuals. This includes taking
         precautions to ensure the accuracy of data, as well as protecting it
         from unauthorized access or accidental disclosure to inappropriate individuals.
         Furthermore, procedures must be established to allow individuals to review
         their records and correct inaccuracies.</p>
       <p>This imperative implies that only the necessary amount of personal information
         be collected in a system, that retention and disposal periods for that
         information be clearly defined and enforced, and that personal information
         gathered for a specific purpose not be used for other purposes without
         consent of the individual(s). These principles apply to electronic communications,
         including electronic mail, and prohibit procedures that capture or monitor
         electronic user data, including messages,without the permission of users
         or bona fide authorization related to system operation and maintenance.
         User data observed during the normal duties of system operation and maintenance
         must be treated with strictest confidentiality, except in cases where
         it is evidence for the violation of law, organizational regulations,
         or this Code. In these cases, the nature or contents of that information
         must be disclosed only to proper authorities. (See 1.9)</p>
       <p>1.8 Honor confidentiality.</p>
       <p>The principle of honesty extends to issues of confidentiality of information
         whenever one has made an explicit promise to honor confidentiality or,
         implicitly, when private information not directly related to the performance
         of one's duties becomes available. The ethical concern is to respect
         all obligations of confidentiality to employers, clients, and users unless
         discharged from such obligations by requirements of the law or other
         principles of this Code.</p>
       <p><strong>2. MORE SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.</strong></p>
       <p>As an ACM computing professional I will ....</p>
       <p>2.1 Strive to achieve the highest quality, effectiveness and dignity
         in both the process and products of professional work.</p>
       <p> Excellence is perhaps the most important obligation of a professional.
         The computing professional must strive to achieve quality and to be cognizant
         of the serious negative consequences that may result from poor quality
         in a system.</p>
       <p>2.2 Acquire and maintain professional competence.</p>
       <p>Excellence depends on individuals who take responsibility for acquiring
         and maintaining professional competence. A professional must participate
         in setting standards for appropriate levels of competence, and strive
         to achieve those standards. Upgrading technical knowledge and competence
         can be achieved in several ways:doing independent study; attending seminars,
         conferences, or courses; and being involved in professional organizations.</p>
       <p>2.3 Know and respect existing laws pertaining to professional work.</p>
       <p>ACM members must obey existing local, state,province, national, and
         international laws unless there is a compelling ethical basis not to
         do so. Policies and procedures of the organizations in which one participates
         must also be obeyed. But compliance must be balanced with the recognition
         that sometimes existing laws and rules may be immoral or inappropriate
         and, therefore, must be challenged. Violation of a law or regulation
         may be ethical when that law or rule has inadequate moral basis or when
         it conflicts with another law judged to be more important. If one decides
         to violate a law or rule because it is viewed as unethical, or for any
         other reason, one must fully accept responsibility for one's actions
         and for the consequences.</p>
       <p>2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.</p>
       <p>Quality professional work, especially in the computing profession, depends
         on professional reviewing and critiquing. Whenever appropriate,individual
         members should seek and utilize peer review as well as provide critical
         review of the work of others.</p>
       <p>2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems
         and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.</p>
       <p> Computer professionals must strive to be perceptive, thorough, and
         objective when evaluating, recommending, and presenting system descriptions
         and alternatives. Computer professionals are in a position of special
         trust, and therefore have a special responsibility to provide objective,
         credible evaluations to employers, clients, users, and the public. When
         providing evaluations the professional must also identify any relevant
         conflicts of interest, as stated in imperative 1.3</p>
       <p>As noted in the discussion of principle 1.2 on avoiding harm, any signs
         of danger from systems must be reported to those who have opportunity
         and/or responsibility to resolve them. See the guidelines for imperative
         1.2 for more details concerning harm,including the reporting of professional
         violations.</p>
       <p>2.6 Honor contracts, agreements, and assigned responsibilities.</p>
       <p> Honoring one's commitments is a matter of integrity and honesty.For
         the computer professional this includes ensuring that system elements
         perform as intended. Also, when one contracts for work with another party,
         one has an obligation to keep that party properly informed about progress
         toward completing that work.</p>
       <p> A computing professional has a responsibility to request a change in
         any assignment that he or she feels cannot be completed as defined. Only
         after serious consideration and with full disclosure of risks and concerns
         to the employer or client, should one accept the assignment. The major
         underlying principle here is the obligation to accept personal accountability
         for professional work. On some occasions other ethical principles may
         take greater priority.</p>
       <p> A judgment that a specific assignment should not be performed may not
         be accepted. Having clearly identified one's concerns and reasons for
         that judgment, but failing to procure a change in that assignment, one
         may yet be obligated, by contract or by law, to proceed as directed.
         The computing professional's ethical judgment should be the final guide
         in deciding whether or not to proceed. Regardless of the decision, one
         must accept the responsibility for the consequences.</p>
       <p> However, performing assignments &quot;against one's own judgment&quot; does
         not relieve the professional of responsibility for any negative consequences.</p>
       <p>2.7 Improve public understanding of computing and its consequences.</p>
       <p>Computing professionals have a responsibility to share technical knowledge
         with the public by encouraging understanding of computing, including
         the impacts of computer systems and their limitations. This imperative
         implies an obligation to counter any false views related to computing.</p>
       <p>2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized
         to do so.</p>
       <p>Theft or destruction of tangible and electronic property is prohibited
         by imperative 1.2? &quot;Avoid harm to others.&quot; Trespassing and
         unauthorized use of a computer or communication system is addressed by
         this imperative. Trespassing includes accessing communication networks
         and computer systems, or accounts and/or files associated with those
         systems, without explicit authorization to do so. Individuals and organizations
         have the right to restrict access to their systems so long as they do
         not violate the discrimination principle (see 1.4). No one should enter
         or use another's computer system, software, or data files without permission.
         One must always have appropriate approval before using system resources,
         including .rm57 communication ports, file space, other system peripherals,
         and computer time.</p>
       <p>3. ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP IMPERATIVES.</p>
       <p>As an ACM member and an organizational leader, I will ....</p>
       <p>BACKGROUND NOTE:This section draws extensively from the draft IFIP Code
         of Ethics,especially its sections on organizational ethics and international
         concerns. The ethical obligations of organizations tend to be neglected
         in most codes of professional conduct, perhaps because these codes are
         written from the perspective of the individual member. This dilemma is
         addressed by stating these imperatives from the perspective of the organizational
         leader. In this context&quot;leader&quot; is viewed as any organizational
         member who has leadership or educational responsibilities. These imperatives
         generally may apply to organizations as well as their leaders. In this
         context&quot;organizations&quot; are corporations, government agencies,and
         other &quot;employers,&quot; as well as volunteer professional organizations.</p>
       <p>3.1 Articulate social responsibilities of members of an organizational
         unit and encourage full acceptance of those responsibilities.</p>
       <p> Because organizations of all kinds have impacts on the public, they
         must accept responsibilities to society. Organizational procedures and
         attitudes oriented toward quality and the welfare of society will reduce
         harm to members of the public, thereby serving public interest and fulfilling
         social responsibility. Therefore,organizational leaders must encourage
         full participation in meeting social responsibilities as well as quality
         performance.</p>
       <p>3.2 Manage personnel and resources to design and build information systems
         that enhance the quality of working life.</p>
       <p> Organizational leaders are responsible for ensuring that computer systems
         enhance, not degrade, the quality of working life. When implementing
         a computer system, organizations must consider the personal and professional
         development, physical safety, and human dignity of all workers. Appropriate
         human?computer ergonomic standards should be considered in system design
         and in the workplace.</p>
       <p>3.3 Acknowledge and support proper and authorized uses of an organization's
         computing and communication resources.</p>
       <p>Because computer systems can become tools to harm as well as to benefit
         an organization, the leadership has the responsibility to clearly define
         appropriate and inappropriate uses of organizational computing resources.
         While the number and scope of such rules should be minimal, they should
         be fully enforced when established. </p>
       <p>3.4 Ensure that users and those who will be affected by a system have
         their needs.</p>
       <p> clearly articulated during the assessment and design of requirements;
         later the system must be validated to meet requirements.</p>
       <p>Current system users, potential users and other persons whose lives
         may be affected by a system must have their needs assessed and incorporated
         in the statement of requirements. System validation should ensure compliance
         with those requirements.</p>
       <p>3.5 Articulate and support policies that protect the dignity of users
         and others effected by a computing system.</p>
       <p> Designing or implementing systems that deliberately or inadvertently
         demean individuals or groups is ethically unacceptable. Computer professionals
         who are in decision making positions should verify that systems are designed
         and implemented to protect personal privacy and enhance personal dignity.</p>
       <p>3.6 Create opportunities for members of the organization to learn the
         principles and limitations of computer systems.</p>
       <p>This complements the imperative on public understanding (2.7). Educational
         opportunities are essential to facilitate optimal participation of all
         organizational members. Opportunities must be available to all members
         to help them improve their knowledge and skills in computing, including
         courses that familiarize them with the consequences and limitations of
         particular types of systems.In particular, professionals must be made
         aware of the dangers of building systems around oversimplified models,
         the improbability of anticipating and designing for every possible operating
         condition, and other issues related to the complexity of this profession.</p>
       <p>4.1 Uphold and promote the principles of this Code.</p>
       <p>The future of the computing profession depends on both technical and
         ethical excellence. Not only is it important for ACM computing professionals
         to adhere to the principles expressed in this Code, each member should
         encourage and support adherence by other members.</p>
       <p>4.2 Treat violations of this code as inconsistent with membership in
         the ACM.</p>
       <p>Adherence of professionals to a code of ethics is largely a voluntary
         matter. However, if a member does not follow this code by engaging in
         gross misconduct, membership in ACM may be terminated.</p>
       <p>This Code and the supplemental Guidelines were developed by the Task
         Force for the Revision of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct:
         Ronald E. Anderson, Chair, Gerald Engel, Donald Gotterbarn, Grace C.
         Hertlein, Alex Hoffman, Bruce Jawer, Deborah G. Johnson, Doris K. Lidtke,
         Joyce Currie Little, Dianne Martin, Donn B. Parker, Judith A. Perrolle,
         and Richard S. Rosenberg. The Task Force was organized by ACM/SIGCAS
         and funding was provided by the ACM SIG Discretionary Fund. This Code
         and the supplemental Guidelines were adopted by the ACM Council on October
         16, 1992.</p>
       <p>The reference to Section 1.9 in Section 1.7 should refer to Section
         1.8  There is no Section 1.9.</p>
