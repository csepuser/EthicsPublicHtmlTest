         Subject: SWEcc pullout 
       <p>Date: Sun, 09 Jul 2000 13:05:03 -0500</p>
       <p><br>
         From: &quot;Dennis J. Frailey&quot; &lt;d-frailey@raytheon.com&gt; </p>
       <p>Organization: Raytheon Company</p>
       <p><br>
         To: &quot;Simons, Barbara&quot; &lt;Simons@acm.org&gt; </p>
       <p><br>
         Barbara, I am not surprised at Council's action, but I am very disappointed 
         at the process by which this happened. Specifically I am disappointed 
         at the secretive and relatively exclusionary method that was used. Instead 
         of working with me and the other SWEcc representatives to forge a solution 
         to the problems Council perceived, you took independent action and kept 
         us largely in the dark. You severed a relationship that took several years 
         to develop and discarded a lot of good will as well. </p>
       <p>As late as April l asked Joe Turner if there was anything going on here 
         and offered the assistance of a number of individuals who have contacted 
         me expressing concern over Council's actions and offered to appear before 
         Council to give their views (all different) on this matter. Joe indicated 
         that he knew of nothing &quot;big&quot; that was about to happen. He later 
         called me just before the Council meeting and indicated that something 
         was on the agenda, but by then it was too late for me to do much of anything. 
         Tony Wasserman, a Council candidate and opponent of SWEBOK (and founder 
         of SIGSOFT) was able to make the Council meeting, but later informed me 
         that he was not invited to participate in the deliberations on this issue 
         other than to make a statement before Council went into executive session. 
         He probably knows more about software engineering than anyone else who 
         was present. </p>
       <p>My perception is that Council did not want to hear anything from me or 
         from those who might disagree with the authors of the reports that <br>
         Council solicited. </p>
       <p> At the very least you could have asked me to resign instead of simply 
         pulling the rug from under me without clear message I received is that 
         I am perceived as part of the problem. My guess is that you and Council 
         know very little about what I have been doing on your behalf. </p>
       <p>In my view, based solely on grapevine information, the Council decision 
         was based on incomplete information. For example, I heard tales of SWEcc 
         &quot;concentrating on licensing&quot; that can be readily refuted. However 
         very little has been communicated to me about the content of the reports 
         or the deliberations, and thus I am not able to state much of anything 
         with certainty. </p>
       <p>I want to say more about the fact that ACM's two SWEcc representatives 
         and the ACM leads of the four SWEcc projects were not consulted in this 
         process and our offers of help were not responded to. We are supposedly 
         your representatives here and we have learned things that might have been 
         of value. While our personal opinions may not agree with those of Council 
         on all matters, we have worked on this for many years and we have insights 
         on subtleties that were probably not apparent to those doing the evaluations. 
         For example, NCEES politics. </p>
       <p>I am also disappointed for the hundreds of volunteers many of these volunteers 
         over the years and I cannot even give them the reasons for ACM's actions! 
         <br>
         My guess is that we will lose many of these volunteers, even if some of 
         the projects are continued under a new organization are some things I 
         think may come of this action: <br>
         - This Fall, NCEES and the state licensing boards will agree to institute 
         software engineering examinations, probably as a subset of computer engineering, 
         with IEEE sponsorship. ACM will have little or no influence on this decision 
         or on the content of the examinations. </p>
       <p>- ACM's attempts to address issues such as safety <br>
         critical software will languish for lack of volunteers. I n the meantime, 
         1EEE-CS will begin certifying people for safety critical software expertise. 
       </p>
       <p>- ABET will begin accrediting software engineering <br>
         programs and due to lack of a SWEcc to turn to, <br>
         CSAB will rely on other sources to define the criteria for accreditation. 
         (It is possible that the education project might influence this but other 
         groups are also defining software engineering academic curricnla and there 
         is no longer a coordinating function among them). </p>
       <p>I consider this a sad time for software engineering as a profession. 
         I also consider it a sad time for ACM and fear that ACM membership from 
         the software engineering practitioner community is in jeopardy. </p>
       <p>Regards, Dennis J. Frailey <br>
