   - The IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Computing Machinery have
   formed a Joint Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering
   as
   a Profession (SEEPP). Their Working Groups will soon begin deliberations
   on e-mad and are scheduled to complete their work before November, 1995. This
   project presents a rare opportunity to study a technical profession coming
   into being. We have formed a research group of three (two ethics specialists
   and a computer science specialist) to study the activity of the Working Group
   on Reliability and Safety. We envisage a larger project to follow. We propose
   to study the relationship between individual responsibility, technical standards,
   and professional ethics while joining in the Working Group's deliberations.
   We would produce two reports. One would be a research paper contributing to
   our understanding of professions. The other would be a report that should be
   useful to the Joint Committee in its work.<br>
   We will proceed by monitoring the e-mail of the Working Group, complementing
   that effort by telephone interview from time to time for further explanation,
   and participating in any teleconferences or face-to-face meetings. The research
   team will meet monthly to analyze the process as recorded in e-mail and learned
   from conversation. The project includes three consultants, a sociologist in
   science studies, an expert on software testing and debugging, and a lawyer
   versed in software liability issues. We will call upon them as needed for information
   or help in analyzing what we observe and for comments and suggestions on drafts
   of<br>
   our reports.</p>

       <p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
       <p><br>
   WHAT BALANCE BETWEEN TECHNICAL STANDARDS, PROFESSIONAL<br>
   STANDARDS, AND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION?</p>
       <p><br>
   Last year the IEEE Computer Society and the ACM--the world's two largest organizations
     of computing practitioners (combined membership of more than 175,000)-formed
     a Joint Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering
     as a Profession. In so doing, they created an opportunity to study a profession
     coming into being--and, given the size and importance of the organizations
     involved, an opportunity not likely to be repeated soon.
   They also created an opportunity for scholars concerned with professions to
   make their expertise available to members of a profession at a crucial moment.
   We propose to seize that opportunity before it is lost. We propose to study
   the relationship between individual responsibility, technical standards, and
   professional ethics
   while joining in the deliberations of one of the Joint Steering Committee's
   Working Groups. We would produce two reports. One would be a research paper
   contributing to our understanding of professions. The other would be a report
   that should be useful to the Joint Committee in its work. Our interdisciplinary
   research
   group brings together a range of skills ideal for what we propose.<br>
   The Joint Steering Committee established three task forces. One is to identify
   the body of knowledge and recommended practices that constitute the expertise
   of the new profession. A second is to define a curriculum for the training
   of members of the new profession (or, at least, set certain minimum educational
   standards). The third is to document and codify ethical and professional practices
   for
   members of the new profession. Each of these task forces is supposed to
   complete work by November 1995. Once the three report, they will be faced with
   the complex task of integrating ideas about what the technical knowledge of
   the profession is with what its professional and educational standards should
   be.
   What they decide may have substantial effects on who can engage in software
   development, what is expected of them, and what they have a right to expect
   of their employers.<br>The Joint Committee will, in effect, be faced with a practical
     version of one of the deepest problems in the theory of professionalism,
         determining how much of professionalism is (or should be) adherence to
         technical standards,
     how much having the appropriate training, and how much
     maintaining ethical standards. We might illustrate the problem with an example.
     Bugs are a problem in software. They can be a serious problem, especially
         when the software runs an important business function like check writing
         or a piece
     of equipment that can cause great harm if it works improperly. No complex
         software is free of bugs. Testing can remove most, but testing is expensive.
         How much
     testing is enough?
     There are at least three ways to answer this question.
     One is organizational. A company might, for example, adopt the Cleanroom
         Process Model (CPM) where the goal is to produce software with very few
         defects by
     incremental development, formal specification languages, proofs of correctness,
     and statistically based independent testing. (Lidger, 1994) Few organizations
     have found this approach attractive. The Software Engineering Institute at
     Carnegie-Mellon has proposed another approach, the Capability Maturity Model
     (CMM). (Paulk et al., 1993) CMM attempts to improve software by increasing
     the &quot;maturity&quot; of the process. CMM has many levels. To reach the
     higher levels, an organization must commit considerable time and effort.
     CMM does not formally address testing at
     the lower levels, and few companies are at the higher levels. But, even if
     they were, there would be no assurance of software with relatively few defects.<br>
     A ..second way to answer the question is to have degree-granting institutions
     teach certain testing procedures as standard practice. This would assure
     that the software developers they graduate will routinely use those procedures
     whether
     their companies think to require them or not. A third way is to make it part
     of practicing software development as a profession that one cannot properly
     sign off on a piece of software unless satisfied that it has been satisfactorily
     tested. Since a
     professional's being satisfied is not merely a matter of whether the test
     meets recommended technical standards (though it generally means at least
     that),
     an ethical standard provides another way of protecting end-users. Such protection
     is important in a field like software development. Change has been so fast
     that
     the technical standards have often been one or two steps behind the technology.
     These three ways of answering the question of how much to test are, of course,
     not necessarily inconsistent. But there is a tension between them.
     Because software development is such a large field, we propose to focus in
     this first exploratory research on only one part of the field, testing of
     software for safety and reliability. This sub-field corresponds to one of
     the Working
     Groups the task force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices
     has set up--as well as to a specialty in software development itself. We
     plan to attach ourselves to this Working Group (Reliability and Safety) and
     follow
     its process from stating the
     problem, to gathering ideas, to deliberation, to final recommendation, to
     dissolution. We hope this will lead to a larger project that picks up from
     there. We envisage
     a more open-ended sequel that might include tracking the working group's
     recommendations through the task force's deliberations, the deliberations
     of the Joint Committee,
     and so on until final resolution (presumably, approval by the IEEE
     and ACM). We have formed a research team consisting of three members and
     three consultants to carry out our initial research plan. The members are
     Hene Burnstein
     (CS, an expert in the technical management of software development), Michael
     Davis (CSEP, an expert on business ethics and codes of ethics), and Vivian
     Weil (CSEP, expert on engineering ethics). The three consultants are Ullica
     Segerstrale (a social scientist working in science studies), Bogdan Korel
     (CS, an expert on software testing and debugging), and Barry Weiss (a lawyer
     versed
     in software liability issues). Our research plan has four parts:</p>
       <p>
   1. The working group on reliability and testing plans to do most of its work
   by e-mail, with only a few face-to-face meetings. We can therefore study
   its work in large part by reading its mail (which is supposed to be open to
   everyone). We would complement reading the mail by telephone interview
   from time to time a) to clear up matters e-mail leaves unclear and b) to
   make sure we aren't missing anything important (for example, the fruit of
   phone conversations or an informal chat at a conference). We would also<br>
   participate in the few face-to-face meetings (whether these turn out to be<br>
   at conferences or by teleconference).</p>
       <p>
   2. The three members of the research team will meet monthly to analyze the<br>
   process recorded in e-mail (and what we have learned by phone). We will<br>
   be especially concerned to identify issues in need of further study. Some of
   this will simply be factual: for example, if an e-mail message refers to a
   technical standard
   none of us recognizes, we would have to ask the most appropriate member of
   the research group to find out what it is and why it matters. Some of the further
   study will, however, be of a different order: for example, if an e-mail message
   claims that a certain testing procedure makes ethical standards of a certain
   sort unnecessary (without explaining that claim), we might want to ask the
   author for an explanation; and, if asking fails to generate a satisfactory<br>
   one, may want to search the literature for a rationale in order to assess the
   claim. We are interested in studying tensions that may arise between the educational
   approaches of computer science and engineering and between the role of technical
   methods and ethical standards in promoting appropriate standards of care. In
   studying how professionals develop and negotiate standards, we will attend
   to the reasons they give and try to identify factors that influence outcomes.
   We aim to obtain results generalizable to other groups. We will call upon the
   consultants as needed for information or help in analyzing what we observe.</p>
       <p>
   3. This discussion, shadowing the official working group, should help us<br>
   develop our own understanding of the issues with which the working group<br>
   is dealing, an independent expertise, and--given our research group's make<br>
   up--a perspective importantly different from the official working group's<br>
 &quot;insider&quot; perspective. While we don't expect our view to be opposed
 to the
   (initial) views of the official working group, we do expect it to be different
   enough to be useful now and then, more because it will pick out or emphasize
   considerations insiders may overlook or, at least, fail to appreciate, than
   because of any fundamental disagreement<br>
   4. Once the working group completes its work, we will prepare a report summarizing
   and analyzing their work. The draft will be submitted to our consultants for
   comment and suggestions.<br>
   We expect this research to have at least four outcomes:<br>
       <br>
   1. The report of what we have observed during, the year of our initial study
     This should take the form a) of a report to the ACM and IEEE and b) of one
     or more research publications. Our research publications could contribute
     to three fields: the sociology of professions; professional ethics; and (perhaps)
     technical management</p>
       <p>2. Enough contacts, experience, and insight propose a
     larger project to study the larger process of professionalizing software
         developers of which the
         working<br>
         group activity is but a small part. Such a proposal would, of course,
         be contingent on the success of this project, but also on our making
         a determination,
         impossible
       to make now, about how much a larger project is likely to add to what we
         have already learned about the relation of individual responsibility,
       technical standards, and professional ethics.</p>
       <p>3. Ideas for doing a better
           job of teaching testing to future software developers, whether trained
           in an engineering or computer science department.
           We expect
       these ideas to emerge from the continual contact between members of our
         interdisciplinary research team as they work together in the unusual
         circumstance of observing
       a new set of professional standards (and a new profession) coming into<br>
       existence. We therefore view this project as, among other things, an aid
       to revising courses (or adding new ones) to better educate the next generation
     of software developers. Whatever useful ideas come out of our interdisciplinary
     meetings would, of course, also be published in an appropriate place--and
       may,
     then, lead as well to other new ideas for improving the continuing education
       of today's software developers.</p>
       <p>4. Ideas the Joint Committee, its task force,
         or working -group may find useful. Because the Joint Committee has adopted
         an open process, allowing everyone to read the committee debate (on e-mail)
         and to respond, we
         hope to participate
     in that debate as well as monitor it, not only asking questions both substantive
     and procedural (for our benefit) but asking or answering questions for the
     benefit of the important work the Joint Committee is engaged in.<br>
     We have discussed our proposal with both Donald Gotterbarn, the Task Force's
     ACM Co-Chair, and Keith Miller, the chair of the Reliability and Safety Working
     Group. Both have welcomed us as potential participants as well as observers.<br>

 &gt; We had already heard about you from Deborah Johnson and then<br>
 &gt; learned that you chat the SEEPP working group we wish to attach<br>
 &gt; ourselves to as researchers rather than as participants of the usual<br>
 &gt; kind. We plan to submit a proposal to NSF's Ethics and Values Studies<br>
 &gt; Program for support of a research project to study this task force<br>
 &gt; effort to help the occupational group of software developers become a<br>
 &gt; profession.<br>
 &gt; Our broad interests are professionalism and accountability, and<br>
 &gt; our focus is on testing of software to assure safety and reliability.<br>
 &gt; Donald Gotterbarn knows about and approves our proposal. We hope<br>
 &gt; that you would welcome the research effort we propose.<br>

   This sounds fine to me. I don't know exactly what you mean by &quot;attach<br>
   ourselves.&quot; Sounds a bit biologically invasive, don't you think? :)<br>
   Sounds like your interests and mine are very close. My only regret is that<br>
   you won't be participating directly. Let me know how I can help.<br>
