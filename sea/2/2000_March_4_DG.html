 9. 2001 Meeting Schedule<br>
 1. Introductions<br>
 This was the fourth meeting of the Software Engineering Coordinating Committee<br>
 (SWECC), a joint activity of the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society (CS). Gerald
 Engel<br>
 attended the first part of the meeting to report on the progress of the Guests
 at this<br>
 meeting included representatives of three of the four SWECC projects: Robert
 Dupuis.and Pierre Bourque for the SWEBOK project, Don Gotterbarn for the code
 of ethics<br>
 project, and Laurie Werth for the education project. Dennis Frailey volunteered
 to prepare<br>
 the minutes of the meeting.<br>
 Action Item 4-1 Prepare and distribute minutes of fourth meeting [Frailey]<br>
 2. Review of minutes<br>
 The minutes of the third SWECC meeting.<br>
 3. Review of action items<br>
 The committee reviewed the list of action items, noting those that had been completed,<br>
 and setting new completion dates for those that had not been completed.<br>
 4. Working Session<br>
 4.1 ABET/CSAB integration issues<br>
 A brief discussion of this subject ensued, primarily around the question of the
 status of<br>
 software engineering accreditation. It was clear that little information was
 currently<br>
 available and no explicit SWEcc action was apparent at this time.<br>
 4.2 Missouri Computer Engineering proposal<br>
 The SWEcc has been apprised of software engineering licensing proposals in the
 states<br>
 of Indiana, New Mexico, and Missouri in addition to Texas' current licensing
 activities.<br>
 SWEcc suspects there are others as well. Several such proposals are to be discussed<br>
 this Fall at the annual, national meeting ot the professional engineering societies
 and the<br>
 NCEES. Several of these bodies have sought advice and direction from SWEcc and
 its<br>
 parent societies but due to the ACM Council's position on licensing, SWEcc has
 refrained<br>
 from recommendations or other forms of active involvement. Nevertheless, we have
 tried<br>
 to maintain an awareness of what is going on.<br>
 A proposal by the Missouri Society of Professional Engineers is particularly
 important. A<br>
 copy of this proposal was distributed to the SWEcc members present. This proposal<br>
 would define a computer engineering examination that would be primarily focused
 on<br>
 software engineering and would, in effect, license software engineers as a specialty<br>
 within computer engineering. This proposal will be presented at the national
 meeting of<br>
 the NCEES this Fall as an alternative to the Texas proposal to license software
 engineers<br>
 as a separate discipline.<br>
 There was a general perception that the Missouri proposal would be less desirable
 than<br>
 the Texas proposal for software engineering as a profession, possibly serving
 to divide<br>
 the community but also placing software engineering in a less influential and<br>
 fundamentally inappropriate position as a subsidiary of computer engineering
 in the<br>
 minds of the professional engineering community. There was discussion of potential<br>
 actions that might be taken by SWEcc or the societies in relation to this, such
 as working<br>
 with the professional engineers to develop a joint proposal that would be less
 detrimental<br>
 to software engineering. For reasons discussed above, no action was taken.<br>
 4.3 Request for definition of software engineering.<br>
 The Texas Board of Professional Engineers asked SWEcc to review their definition
 of<br>
 software engineering and suggest revisions. Individual members and guests.communicated
 their thoughts on this but no formal response was made, for the reasons<br>
 stated above.<br>
 5. Code of Ethics Project Report<br>
 The Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices Project (SEEPP) asked
 for<br>
 comments on a publicity poster. SWECC agreed that the content was okay, and the<br>
 presentation could be improved by consulting with a graphics artist.<br>
 Don Gotterbarn gave a report from Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
 Practices<br>
 Project (SEEPP). The bulk of the report consisted of details about current efforts
 to promote the<br>
 code of ethics by including flyers in ACM Communications and IEEE Software. Due
 to differences<br>
 in publishing techniques, it will not be possible to use the exact same printing
 process to produce<br>
 the flyers for each publication, so the recommendation (accepted by SWEcc) was
 to amend the<br>
 funding plan to have each society pay for the costs of printing and distributing
 the code in its own<br>
 publication.<br>
 Resolution: The SWEcc approves the proposed logo for the code of ethics<br>
 Resolution: The SWEcc approves the copyright of the logo as a committee asset<br>
 Resolution: The SWEcc approves the proposed revised budget for the code of ethics
 project and<br>
 flyer distribution<br>
 Action Item 4-2 Include a pointer to the code of ethics site in the SWEcc web
 site [Tripp]<br>
 Action Item 4-3 Make recommendations for improvements in the SWEcc web site [All]<br>
 Action Item 4-4 Update the web site [Tripp]<br>
 6. Informal Report on Software Engineering Survey Project<br>
 In the absence of a project representative (Laurie Werth is a participant but
 was not prepared to<br>
 represent the project), the SWEcc reviewed information available to us about
 the status and<br>
 progress of this activity. SWEcc members brought up the following issues:<br>
 &middot; The report seems to rely solely on results of a survey that has not
 yet been widely established or<br>
 accepted, when there are many existing lists and other sources of information
 available. For<br>
 credibility, it would seem that existing sources ought to be used to populate
 a baseline version of<br>
 the report, with the survey data being used to augment and correct that information.<br>
 &middot; There is little information available about whether the survey methodology
 is working<br>
 &middot; It is unclear how the data in the survey are verified<br>
 Action Item 4-5 Notify survey project leaders that we wish to meet with them
 via conference call<br>
 to discuss their plans, as well as the issues of using existing sources, methodology,
 and<br>
 verification [Frailey]<br>
 7. Informal Report on Education Project<br>
 We were informed that Software Engineering Education Project (SWEEP) had had
 a recent<br>
 meeting but there was no formal report available yet. Laurie Werth did report
 that the following<br>
 items were discussed:<br>
 &middot; Accreditation criteria for technical and advanced degrees<br>
 &middot; A philosophy document<br>
 &middot; Presentations at various meetings.&middot; A draft curriculum<br>
 &middot; A working plan for the long awaited workshop on software engineering
 education (apparently<br>
 there has been some progress in getting NSF support, but more needs to be done)<br>
 SWEcc communicated the following to Laurie:<br>
 &middot; SWEcc believes the relationship between the undergraduate curriculum
 recommendations and<br>
 SWEBOK need to be definitized.<br>
 &middot; SWEEP should copy its minutes to SEPEP so that the code of ethics issues
 that relate to<br>
 curriculum and such can be coordinated<br>
 &middot; SWEcc would like to meet with SWEEP via conference call to review their
 plans and the issues<br>
 mentioned above<br>
 8. SWEBOK Project Report<br>
 Pierre Bourque and Robert Dupuis reported on the status and plans of the Software
 Engineering<br>
 Body of Knowledge Project (SWEBOK) project. Although there have been some relatively
 minor<br>
 schedule slips due to delayed responses by certain authors, progress is nearly
 complete on the<br>
 current, ironman phase of the project. Highlights include:<br>
 &middot; The third (and final) round of the review process is in full swing,
 with several hundred reviewers<br>
 participating. These reviewers come from over 50 countries and represent both
 the research and<br>
 practitioner communities. SWEcc asked SWEBOK to evaluate the demographics of
 the reviewer<br>
 community and report on these to the SWEBOK advisory board at its next meeting.<br>
 &middot; Workshops are planned at both CSEET and STC to discuss the BOK with
 a wider audience and<br>
 gain additional feedback from the education and practitioner communities, respectively.
 [Editor's<br>
 note: good attendance was reported at both events, with over 300 at STC.]<br>
 &middot; All actions and decisions remain open and accessible to the public through
 the SWEBOK web<br>
 site<br>
 &middot; A final document is expected to be completed this summer, with a target
 effective date of January<br>
 1, 2001 after approval by the sponsoring societies.<br>
 There was general discussion of the SWEBOK activities, including possible uses
 of the material<br>
 as a resource by teachers and practitioners.<br>
 Resolution: SWEcc thanks the SWEBOK team for the quality of its work and its
 contribution to<br>
 software engineering as a profession.<br>
 Action Item 4-6 Investigate forms of recognition of the SWEBOK volunteers from
 the ACM and<br>
 IEEE Computer Society. [Frailey/Tripp]<br>
 Action Item 4-7 Invite distinguished experts in software engineering to participate
 in the third<br>
 review round [All].<br>
 9. Meeting Schedule for SWEcc for 2001<br>
 No face to face meetings are planned for the remainder of 2000. However we expect
 to<br>
 have conference call meetings with the SWEEP and Survey projects to review their<br>
 progress and plans and to have a conference call later in the year to discuss
 approval of<br>
 the SWEBOK final document.<br>
 Annex 1. Action Items<br>
 The following action items have been completed.<br>
 &middot; 1-7: Education representatives will invite their respective societies
 to participate in SWEBOK.<br>
 [Doris Carver and Laurie Werth].&middot; 1-10: Design and produce letterhead
 and business cards for SWECC. [Dennis Frailey and<br>
 Leonard Tripp] [Resolved by agreeing that we would simply use society letterhead.]<br>
 &middot; 3-1: : The recorder will distribute the minutes of this [third] meeting
 to SWECC and to the web<br>
 site. [Mark Ardis]<br>
 &middot; 3-2: SWECC will prepare a plan for working with CSAB and ABET. SWECC
 needs to track issues<br>
 and plans of CSAB and ABET, and SWECC needs to identify all the important players
 in the<br>
 integration of these two groups. [Doris Carver and Dennis Frailey] [this was
 resolved by<br>
 amending this action to require a regular discussion of the status of this effort
 at SWEcc meetings<br>
 and development of an action plan at such time as the exact needs are more apparent.]<br>
 &middot; 3-3: Distribute ACM position on SWECC to SWEEP. [Dennis Frailey]<br>
 &middot; 3-4: Someone is supposed to talk to Schwartz(?) about something related
 to the EAC issue. [this<br>
 has been overcome by events]<br>
