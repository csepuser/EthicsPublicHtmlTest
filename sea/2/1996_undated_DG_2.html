       <p>To the Joint IEEE-CS/ACM Steering Committee on the Professionalization
         of Software Engineering
       <p> The Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
                     Practices has completed its work in developing a Software
                     Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice and
                     recommends its approval by both professional societies. We
                     recommend for this action for the following reason: </p>
                   <p>Support by both societies will be a public assertion by
                     the profession of s unified commitment to ethical responsibility,
                     The Code represents and international standard of practice,
                     The Code has been reviewed and adopted by Industry, Represents
                     a broad consensus of the profession Demonstrated positive
                     support for the Code Support from Academe?</p>
                   <p> The approval of this Code by both societies will be a significant
                     forward step for the computing profession. The cooperative
                     support given by both societies to the development and support
                     of this code underscores the importance of a commitment to
                     ethical practices by the profession and will serve as a model
                     for other developing professions. </p>
                   <p>The development of the this Code was unique in its international
                     flavor. The task force and the executive committee had international
                     representation, e.g. Europe, Africa, Australia, and North
                     America. As the process of development and revision proceeded,
                     this web of international participation and comment spread
                     throughout the world. In an effort to be consistent with
                     the Codes of the major computing professional societies throughout
                     the world, the task force solicited response from the major
                     computing societies members. Comment and support was also
                     received from the IFIP.</p>
                   <p>One line about at least one laywer concered with computer
                     law and airforce major to assure consistency with military.</p>
                   <p> The Code has been positively reviewed by several ethics
                     officers and ethics directors of multinational organizations
                     after sharing it with computing professionals in their organizations.
                     Such industries include, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Gruman,
                     Digital Equipment, etc. We also have results from the survey
                     published in CACM and Computer from CEO's of smaller companies
                     indicating strong support for the Code. In fact, the Code
                     has been adopted by some organizations as their corporate
                     code with only minor modifications, eg. replacing the expression &quot;software
                     engineer&quot; with &quot;IS professional&quot;.</p>
                   <p>The Code was developed using a process of continuous review
                     and revision. An &quot;almost complete draft&quot; of the
                     Code was published on several web sites, in some Sig journals
                     and in Computer and CACM. The results of that survey were
                     that most items had greater than 9X percent support with
                     many at 100%. The highest level of opposition to any clause
                     was 12%. (SHOULD WE ADMIT A MISTAKEN PHRASE) The final version
                     of the Code was developed by addressing the clearly stated
                     concerns with this and the other clause which received a
                     10% percent negative vote. </p>
                   <p>Prior to the recent modifications the clauses of the code,
                     on average, received less that 4% opposition on average.
                     We are confident that if the survey were to be taken again
                     all clauses would receive an approval rating in the high
                     90s.. COPYRIGHT- The Code has also received a positive response
                     from academe. We have received several requests to have the
                     Code included in Computer Ethics and Software Engineering
                     textbooks and been asked to develop case studies for software
                     engineering classes based on the Code.</p>
                   <p>The current version of the Code is as close to a total consensus
                     as could be expected of any document reviewed by human beings.!!!</p>
                   <p>NEED A PLACE FOR THIS This Code complements the more general
                     Codes of Ethics of both societies which address the issues
                     of the computing profession as a whole. The Code of Software
                     Engineering Ethics and Professional practices address the
                     ethical issues and standards of conduct which arise within
                     the practice of software engineering. In this sense the code
                     is not a replacement for any exiting code..</p>
                   <p align="center">============</p>
                   <p>The Code has already proven to be a dynamic and useful document
                     becoming a model within particular industries. Several of
                     us are on IEEE -CS and ACM committees which are responsible
                     for the maintenance and education OF the societies codes
                     of ethics.</p>
                   <p> To support the maintenance and education of the Code, we
                     plan to maintain the Code on several websites, eg, Software
                     Engineering Ethics Research Institute, Center for Computing
                     and Social Responsibility, and continue to gather input from
                     the community and develop examples and share examples developed
                     by industry of cases related to clauses of the code. It would
                     be beneficial to the profession if the joint societies sponsored
                     this effort and approved the Code.</p>
                   <p>AMEN.</p>
                   <p>We need an action plan. We look forward to hearing from
                     you on how to proceed with this effort.</p>
