                   <p>Comments: IEEE Final Ballot General comments: 1. Although 
 
                     a preferred title would simply be Software Engineering Code 
 
                     of Professional Practice, one could accept Code of Ethics 
 
                     for the short version and Code of Professional Practice for 
 
                     the full one. Both titles together are confusing. 2. Even 
 
                     if the drafters claim the code is not prescriptive -in the 
 
                     short version preamble, the levels of fine detail often make 
 
                     it appear so. The full version preamble will specify the code 
 
                     prescribes these as obligations of anyone ...! Does the IEEE 
 
                     have specific plans to lobby to see the code introduced as 
 
                     a means of discussion in educational curricula?</p>
 
                   <p> And where? Please avoid technology imperialism and stress 
 
                     aspirations more than prescriptions and details. 3. A clearer 
 
                     hierarchy of concerns is now more evident than in previous 
 
                     drafts e.g., the public; client or employer, etc. This i!s 
 
                     useful. There are, however, still clear conflicts of interest 
 
                     that ariseA the conflict between Public and Client or Employer 
 
                     is one of major concern. 4. Nowhere is what is ethics or an 
 
                     ethical approach made clear. There is no reference to any 
 
                     underlying philosophies or theories of ethics. Hence, there 
 
                     is no really clear, delineated assistance for the individual/group 
 
                     in making ethical decisions about particular behaviors. </p>
 
                   <p>Though fundamental principles are referred to in passing, 
 
                     the ordinary software engineer would have no idea of what 
 
                     these are as a result of reading the code. Perhaps the drafters 
 
                     take an implicitly utilitarian approach? How to help in enforcing 
 
                     then item 8.08? See also comments on the Preamble of the full 
 
                     version and its vicious circle of self-foundation. 5. Both 
 
                     Preambles stress: Making software engineering a beneficial 
 
                     and respected profession94: isnt it a bit ethno-ce!ntric ... 
 
                     and contradictory to another assertion the public interest 
 
                     is central to this code? 6. There is no indication of any 
 
                     method of enforcement or potential penalties to be made if 
 
                     the content is transgressed. See in 6.11-6.13, items lost 
 
                     among others, and which could constitute the basis for enforcement 
 
                     and complaint procedures. Specific comments on the Short version: 
 
                     Item 5. Why the word ethical here and only here? Suggestion: 
 
                     promote an approach to ... which is in accordance with this 
 
                     code. Specific comments on the Full version: Preamble: - Growing 
 
                     role in ...: Why to put commerce in first? - Obligations founded 
 
                     in the software engineers humanity? What does it mean? And 
 
                     later The Code provides en ethical foundation ... </p>
 
                   <p>We are in a vicious circle of self-foundation? - In general, 
 
                     the code appears overly illustrative, eve!n down to rather 
 
                     fine details about very particular behaviors: no doubt, however, 
 
                     its drafters have distinct examples of particular personal 
 
                     or organizational behaviors in mind that they wish to see 
 
                     countered. But is it really needed to go so far? Will a too 
 
                     long code not be quickly forgotten? Wouldnt be better to alleviate 
 
                     the full version and have a kind of accompanying comment more 
 
                     explicit on what you have in mind? - Many items, although 
 
                     probably interesting for the quality of the profession, are 
 
                     out of scope from an ethical point of view, like for instance 
 
                     2.04, 3.05 to 3.11, 5.02 and ff., but also others. </p>
 
                   <p>It weakens the code. Principles and details: A- 1.01 to 1.08: 
 
                     the sequence order is all but clear. 1.07 for instance, although 
 
                     quite welcomed, looks like a lost item in the list! - 2.02 
 
                     is badly formulated. How could you sign a code of ethics and, 
 
                     at the same time, retain something illegally or une!thically? 
 
                     I was thinking reading more the Software Publishers Associations 
 
                     Statement on Anti-piracy than a Code of professional responsibility! 
 
                     - 2.09: incomprehensible. - 3.03 is a hidden item in the list. 
 
                     In my view, it is not a detail, but the principle. - 3.04: 
 
                     Could specifically include on-the-job training which is particularly 
 
                     evident in the work of e.g., Japanese and British software 
 
                     engineers. - 4.04 is so obvious that the reason why it is 
 
                     here is not clear. Moreover, what is its specific relation 
 
                     to software engineering? </p>
 
                   <p>It may also depend on cultures and countries! 0A- Principle 
 
                     5: see comment about ethical in the Comment on the short version. 
 
                     - 5.11 and 5.12 are most probably the cause of conflicts of 
 
                     interests. It would be better to put them at the beginning 
 
                     of the list, or even to put them in the principle, as suggested 
 
                     in my comment supra. - Certain clauses in this managerial 
 
                     section !are highly contingent on specific organizational 
 
                     practices, responsibility for which may be outside the control 
 
                     of software engineers or their managers, e.g., human resource 
 
                     or personnel departments, salary sections, ... - 6.02: what 
 
                     is the meaning of such an assertion? - 6.06 is not clear. 
 
                     A- 6.11 is spelled out in such terms that is something which 
 
                     is more professional than ethical! - 8.08 is a duplication 
 
                     of 6.11 N1. </p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: The first paragraph of the Preamble 
 
                     is designed to show the synergy of the Principles and the 
 
                     Clauses. If , as you say, the phase &#8220;Code of Ethics 
 
                     &#8220; is appropriate for the first part and &#8220;Code 
 
                     of Conduct is appropriate for the second part, then since 
 
                     the second part of the Code contains both the principles of 
 
                     the first part and additional clauses, it seems appropriate 
 
                     by your standards to call the combined document a Code of 
 
                     Ethics and Professional Practice. N 2. The task force has 
 
                     proposed continuing education support for the code. Details 
 
                     of that support are generally not part of a Code. R 3 .See 
 
                     your own comment 5 where you recognize that we do prioritize 
 
                     this conflict and have a paramouncy clause like other engineering 
 
                     disciplines recognizing the interest of the Public as paramount 
 
                     over other interests.</p>
 
                   <p>R.4 Most codes do not have reference to particular philosopher&#8217;s 
 
                     positions by the philosopher&#8217;s name or label of philosophical 
 
                     position. The Code does however include clearly recognizable 
 
                     positions, and offers advice on decision making-see Paragraph 
 
                     4 preamble -&#8220;Consider broadly those affected by their

                     of the society and not in the Code per se. This is the way

                     the long version seems inconsistent with your earlier rejection

                     describe elements of that ethical stance in this code. </p>

                   <p>Comments: I like the direction of the document and some aspects 
 
                     of it I like very much but I believe it needs one round of 
 
                     revision before it goes out for publication. I will change 
 
                     my vote to positive if there is any reasonable rationale to 
 
                     disposition my comments because Irecognize I am presenting 
 
                     them in a general fashion and there are many ways of addressing 
 
                     my concerns. I will accept the consensus disposition. 1) I 
 
                     found following; principle 1: 2 of 8 sub-bullets; principle 
 
                     2: 7 of 9 sub-bullets; principle 3; 3 of 15 sub-bullets; principle 
 
                     4: 4 of 6 sub-bulletsB principle 5: 7 of 12 sub-bullets; principle 
 
                     6; 6 of 13 sub-bullets; principle 7: 7 of 8 sub-bullets; principle 
 
                     8: 1 of 8 sub-bullets could be classified as generic details 
 
                     which appear to apply to any engineered product and not just 
 
                     a software product. This bothered me because we should acknowledge 
 
                     the corresponding engin!eering principles instead of presenting 
 
                     them as pertaining to software only. 0A 2) I find the concept 
 
                     of software as a component in part of a larger system context 
 
                     missing. The fact that software is pervasive, interfaces to 
 
                     humans, can be embedded, can run stand-alone on another system 
 
                     platform needs to be highlighted. I believe this wider context 
 
                     of software mandates a requirement for a &quot;humble &quot; 
 
                     attitude or respect of the pervasiveness and implications 
 
                     of software. 3) A specific issue that should be highlighted 
 
                     is &quot;lowest-life cycle cost&quot; vs. &quot;lowest development 
 
                     cost&quot; as this is a major instigator of ethical tensions.</p>
 
                   <p> I really liked principle 3 dealing with the product as I 
 
                     was able to clearly relate software issues to this item.</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: A 1.The inclusion of several imperatives 
 
                     from other engineering codes emphasizes the &#8220;Engineering&#8221; 
 
                     in Software Engineering .N 2. The clauses of the code apply 
 
                     to all software whether it is a component of a larger system 
 
                     or an independent system. Nothing is added by adding these 
 
                     phrases.N 3.01 The Code uses &#8220;acceptable cost&#8221; 
 
                     rather than &#8220;lowest cost&#8221; because lowest cost 
 
                     may not always be in the best interest of the public or the 
 
                     customer. See also 2.06 which addresses expensive projects.

                   <p>Comments: I proposed the following change twice already - 
 
                     once at version 3 level and again at version 4.0 , both times 
 
                     in Jan.1998 - . Since the reason for the change seemed to 
 
                     me self-evident, I kept the reasoning down to a minimum and 
 
                     suspect, that this might have been a reason why it was ignored. 
 
                     Since I feel, that this is important, this time I will give 
 
                     you the full reasoning. If you decide to override my objections, 
 
                     I would still like to hear your reasons. ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
                     Second sentence of the third paragraph of the PREAMBLE to 
 
                     the Full Version says: The list of Principles and Clauses 
 
                     is not exhaustive, and should not 0Abe read as separating 
 
                     the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional 0Aconduct 
 
                     in all practical situations.</p>
 
                   <p> When we analyse this sentence, we can say about &quot;the 
 
                     lis!t&quot; that it contains a. Principles b. Clauses ... 
 
                     and that it ... c. is not exhaustive d. should not be read 
 
                     as separating ... We therefore have two distinctive parts 
 
                     of the list, which can be said to have two properties each. 
 
                     Let us look at the four possible combinations: 1. The list 
 
                     of Clauses is not exhaustive OK, the list of Clauses can of 
 
                     course be continued infinitely. 2. The list of Clauses should 
 
                     not be read as ... OK, Necessary condition, otherwise inflexible. 
 
                     3. The list of Principles is not exhaustive The list of Principles 
 
                     IS the base of the Code. Of course, we might later find omissions, 
 
                     but that can be adjusted when we get there. If we say NOW 
 
                     that the list of Principles is not exhaustive, we better sit 
 
                     down and think again.</p>
 
                   <p> 4. The list of Principles should not be! read as ... It 
 
                     is not the Principles, but it is their application - embodied 
 
                     e.g. in the Clauses - , which can separate the acceptable 
 
                     from the unacceptable. It is not necessary to state that something 
 
                     impossible does not apply. Considering the four combinations 
 
                     we can see, that while the properties of the Clauses are well 
 
                     defined by the sentence, we can NOT say the same about the 
 
                     properties of the Principles.0D I therefore propose the sentence 
 
                     to be changed to read: 0AThe list of Clauses is not exhaustive, 
 
                     and should not be read as separating the acceptable from the 
 
                     unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical situations.

                   <p>Comments: This document is, in general, excellent and with 
 
                     a few modifications (listed below) you may convert my vote 
 
                     to affirmative. I applaud and congratulate the Task Force

                     by referencing at the beginning of the Code an independent 
 
                     document, which can be worked on in parallel with this one.

                     entity in each State of the US. </p>
 
                   <p>It may not be used loosely! It is imperative that this Code 
 
                     of Ethics clearly and unambiguously specify the population 
 
                     of individuals to whom it pertains (e.g., only graduates of 
 
                     computer science !programs, anyone who writes/scripts code, 
 
                     or licensed professional engineers [note new Texas licensure 
 
                     procedures]). Not defining the requisite population drastically 
 
                     undermines the utility of this document. Using terms outside 
 
                     of their legally defined meaning is not in the &quot;Public 
 
                     Interest&quot;! This criticism/concern applies everywhere 
 
                     throughout the document where the terms 22professional&quot;, 
 
                     &quot;software&quot;, and &quot;engineer&quot; are used in 
 
                     conjunction. #3. (Principle 3.05) Change &quot;methodology&quot; 
 
                     to &quot;set of methods&quot;. To quote Ivar Jacobson &quot;.. 
 
                     a method is a planned procedure by which a specified goal 
 
                     is approached step by step, not to be confused with methodology, 
 
                     which is the science of methods.&quot; Methodology refers 
 
                     to the study of methods and is inappropriate for 3.05. #4: 
 
                     (Principle 4.05) Begin sentence with the word &quot;Fully&quot;

                     the free expression of ideas is increasingly impacted by software 
 
                     and digital communication systems. The only reference to privacy 
 
                     in the draft document is in section 3.12 which applies to 
 
                     the software PRODUCT. While that addresses the necessity of 
 
                     incorporating privacy preserving features into new software, 
 
                     it does not clearly relate to the ACTIONS of the software 
 
                     engineer, the USES to which the software is applied, and the 
 
                     broader PUBLIC INTEREST in preserving political democracy. 
 
                     The suggested wording changes are intended to emphasise the

                   <p>Comments: Recommended Changes: Delete the first paragraph 
 
                     of the short version preamble which begins &quot;The short 
 
                     version of the code....&quot; This material is too tutorial 
 
                     in nature. Mandatory changes: 1.03 does not seem to recognize 
 
                     that there are legitimate applications of software technology 
 
                     that may have negative consequences on the quality of life 
 
                     of some individuals or result in some harm to the environment. 
 
                     A smart weapons system is an example. The subprinciple 0Ashould 
 
                     be reword to indicate something like &quot;substantially dimminish 
 
                     quality of life or substantially harm the environment.&quot; 
 
                     1.05 Change 22co-operate&quot; to &quot;cooperate.&quot; In 
 
                     at least all of the following subclauses a direct reference 
 
                     is made to some issues about software. I firmly believe that 
 
                     a software engineering professional must be concerned about 
 
                     issues that go beyond ju!st the software that he/she may be 
 
                     working on or with.</p>
 
                   <p> I suggest that a more inclusive word be used such as product, 
 
                     project, or system. See subprinciples 1.05, 1.06, 2.02, 2.07, 
 
                     3.08, 3.10, 3.12, 4.03C 4.06, 6.07, 6.08, 8.01, 8.02, 8.04, 
 
                     8.05. 2.08 Why is the concern for &quot;work detrimental to&quot; 
 
                     restricted to the &quot;primary22 employer? It seems that 
 
                     one should be concerned about work detrimental to any employer 
 
                     or group. As worded it seems to be OK to work for a second 
 
                     employer and one is no longer bound to ensure that the work 
 
                     isn't detrimental in some way. I suggest the wording: &quot;Accept 
 
                     no outside work detrimental to the work they perform for their 
 
                     primary or additional employers.&quot; 3.04 should include 
 
                     a reference to &quot;training&quot; in addition to the reference 
 
                     to &quot;education.&quot; They are not the same. Reword as 
 
                     &quot;..combination of education a!nd training, planned education 
 
                     and training, and experience...&quot; 3.05 editorial change: 
 
                     &quot;Ensure an appropriate methodology is used for any project...&quot; 
 
                     5.09 should also address the issue of giving proper credit 
 
                     for development of intellectural property not just the ownership 
 
                     of intellectual property. Suggest that this be reworded as 
 
                     &quot;Ensure that there is a fair agreement concerning credit 
 
                     for development of and ownership of any software, processes,...&quot;</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: A1.03- We modified clause 1.03 with 
 
                     the utilitarian wording &#8220; The ultimate effect of the 
 
                     work should be to the public good.&#8221; </p>
 
                   <p>That is , harm to someone may be justified (as in &#8220;just 
 
                     war&#8221; theory) if the overall effect is to the greater 
 
                     good of the greater number. The subjective phrase &#8220;substantially&#8221; 
 
                     would have weakened the general application of the ClauseA.We 
 
                     agree that the SE&#8217;s concerns must go beyond the software, 
 
                     that is why we made The Public the first principles - 1.02 
 
                     moderate any interest of the SE with concern for the Public, 
 
                     1.03, the environment, 1.05 matters of grave public concern. 
 
                     We also took care to address this in the preamble.A.3.04 add 
 
                     &#8220;and training&#8221;A 3.05 add &#8220;is used&#8221;N.5.09 
 
                     the issue is whether development of software tenders ownership; 
 
                     that decision would be in the &#8220;fair agreement&#8221;</p>

                   <p>Comments: 1.05 I would change section 1.05 to &quot;Cooperate 
 
                     in efforts to address matters of public concern caused by 
 
                     software, its installation, maintenance or support.&quot; 
 
                     While there are grave matters that affect the public interest, 
 
                     there are other non-grave Aones that are of concern to public 
 
                     interest: e.g., gluttonous software that demands huge memory 
 
                     and high-speed motherboards and processors which are of little 
 
                     value to the general public, e.g., a feature-glutted program 
 
                     only useful to techies and not to the general public. For 
 
                     many standard applications, e.g., wordprocessing, less is 
 
                     better than more. </p>
 
                   <p>Perhaps software could/should be written to disable (and 
 
                     not load in memory) undesireable features. Secondly, there 
 
                     is the issue of software support: unlimited or free installation, 
 
                     maintenance and troubleshooting phone calls, ta!lking to real 
 
                     people and not automated and time-wasting irritations of menus 
 
                     and pre-recorded messages. Thirdly, there should also be mandatory 
 
                     notification of pathces, updates and fixes. Many vendors have 
 
                     taken on the posture of not being responsible for their software. 
 
                     One buys it, cannot get support without charge, and there 
 
                     is never any notification of patches, updates, etc. </p>
 
                   <p>You have indirectly alluded to this issue in this section 
 
                     and section 3, but these issues should be explicitly stated. 
 
                     3.15 should be changed to: Treat software maintenance, currency 
 
                     and improvement with the same professionalism as new development. 
 
                     By currency, I mean that the since society and the working 
 
                     0D environment change, software should always to checked to 
 
                     see if it meets current circumstances and has not become obsolete 
 
                     in some way. 0D I see software improvement! as an ongoing 
 
                     obligation to the public interest (social responsibility29.

                   <p>In general, I want to congratulate those who worked on this 
 
                     code. It is very thoughtful. I especially liked the preamble 
 
                     in its caution to any blind reliance on detailed regulations, 
 
                     the realization of ethical tensions and the need for ongoing 
 
                     ethical deliberation.</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: A 1.05 &#8220;its installation, maintenance,

                     Rather than make a list we inserted the phrase &#8220;all

                     with this document and I commend its authors. With that said,

                     1. Editorial, Preamble (Short Version): &quot;Aspirational&quot; 
 
                     is not a word. Change &quot;gives the aspirational elements&quot; 
 
                     to &quot;summarizes aspirations&quot;. 2. Editorial, Principle 
 
                     1: Change &quot;consistent&quot; to &quot;consistently&quot;. 
 
                     3. BINDING COMMENT, Principle 3: Change &quot;of the highest 
 
                     professional standards available&quot; to &quot;the best possible 
 
                     engineering solution to the problem.&quot; Reason: not all 
 
                     jobs require the highest professional standards. For some 
 
                     it is more cost-effective to provide a simple solution. 4. 
 
                     Editorial, Principle 4: Change &quot;judgement&quot; to &quot;judgment&quot;. 
 
                     5. BINDING COMMENT, Principle 6: Delete &quot;consistent with 
 
                     the public interest&quot;. Reason: this is NOT a trade-off 
 
                     and there is no reason to s!uggest that it is. 6. BINDING 
 
                     COMMENT, 2.05: Change &quot;where such confidentiality is 
 
                     consistent with the public interest&quot; to &quot;within 
 
                     the limits of the law&quot;. Reason: I do not want individual 
 
                     engineers to decide when to divulge my confidential data. 
 
                     I would prefer to trust legal mechanisms to decide when information 
 
                     must be divulged. </p>
 
                   <p>7. Editorial, 2.06: Change &quot;legislation&quot; to &quot;law&quot;. 
 
                     &quot;Law&quot; is finished &quot;legislation&quot;. One should 
 
                     not consider legislation-in-process. 8. BINDING COMMENT, 2.06: 
 
                     Delete &quot;or otherwise to be problematic&quot;. Reason: 
 
                     I have no idea what this means. 9. COMMENT, 3.06: Change &quot;industry&quot; 
 
                     to &quot;professional&quot;. Reason: I think that professional 
 
                     practice standards have a higher degree of significance than 
 
                     industry interface standards. I believe that this distinction

                     Reason: &quot;disreputable&quot; concerns the perceptions 
 
                     of others, no matter how unjustified. </p>

                     advance the profession in ways not consistent with the public 
 
                     interest. Defrauding the public so the profession looks good

                   <p>Comments: The Code of Ethics does not define who or what 
 
                     a software engineer is. In particular, it does not describe 
 
                     the differences2C if any, between a prorgammer and a software 
 
                     engineer. Although this is a good code, employers and employees 
 
                     can say this code doesn't apply to them because they are only 
 
                     programmers and not software engineers. If there is a difference, 
 
                     a description of how one becomes a software engineer should 
 
                     be included. </p>
 
                   <p>Additional comments: A. We had tried to define the scope 
 
                     of the Code in the Preamble paragraph 1 and start of paragraph 
 
                     2. We have made its scope clearer by the inclusion of the 
 
                     phrase &#8220;software engineer&#8221; in paragraph 1. </p>

                   <p>Clause 1.03 Objection Problem: I object to the tense of the 
 
                     phrase &quot;has passed appropriate tests&quot; on both stylistic 
 
                     and semantic grounds. Stylistically, it violates parallel 
 
                     structure, as all the other phrases are in present tense, 
 
                     not past. This should be too &#8211; and for semantic reasons 
 
                     as 0A well. It's not sufficient for the software to have passed 
 
                     tests in0D the past, it should do so currently (to the best 
 
                     of the software engineer's knowledge). (This is not meant 
 
                     to imply that in order to behave ethically that software engineers 
 
                     must re-run all tests after every change to software; the 
 
                     &quot;well-founded belief22 takes care of that concern.) Action:

                     The two are not the same in all cases, and clearly one can

                     vastly different concerns, issues, etc. Similarly, why does 
 
                     the text say &quot;Software engineers shall act in the best

                     interest or concern, or could not even be notified realistically. 
 
                     (For example, why should the &quot;users&quot; of a new mass-market, 
 
                     shrink-wrapped application be notified of its schedule? How 
 
                     would you even do this for a new application? And couldn't

                     Rationale: The law is intended to represent a consensus of 
 
                     public interest. The Code should not encourage violation of 
 
                     the law, but rather promote rational and reasonable laws affecting

                   <p>Comments: I have a great deal of difficulty in assessing

                     - the lists contain a lot of good ideas if tempered with a 
 
                     dose of the real world within which people actually work. 
 
                     If its meant seriously, though, it is ambiguous and lacking 
 
                     verifiable substance. The biggest problem I have is the lack 
 
                     of definitions of the basic concepts underlying the code. 
 
                     The first of these is the public interest. The phrasing here 
 
                     implies that (1) there is a single public interest, (2) it 
 
                     is possible for someone to determine this and (3) there will 
 
                     be general agreement on what it is. I do not believe any of 
 
                     these three is correct. The Public simply does not exist - 
 
                     there are many publics whose interests are frequently in conflict. 
 
                     Thats why humans have invented politics. Similarly, there 
 
                     is !great ambiguity and uncertainty about the interests (clause 
 
                     1.02) of employers, clients and users - and these are frequently 
 
                     in conflict with other and the various public goods. These 
 
                     and similar problems persist through most of the principles. 
 
                     Specifically, looking at only the first thee principles2C 
 
                     I find the following clauses devoid of meaning because of 
 
                     ambiguities in the underlying concepts: 1.02, 1.03, 1.04, 
 
                     1.05, 1.08, 2.02, 2.04, 2.05, 2.07, 2.08, 2.09, 3.01, 3.02, 
 
                     3.03, 3.12. </p>
 
                   <p>I have similar concerns with most of the remaining principles, 
 
                     but this gives enough idea on what is wrong. Some of the clauses 
 
                     pose potential legal concerns. Revealing information, even 
 
                     if in the public interest, may be a breach of contract or 
 
                     violate national security. This involves clauses 1.05, 2.05, 
 
                     3.12.0D Given that most software engineers work as employees, 
 
                     they are frequently not aware of all aspects! of their jobs, 
 
                     and may not be able to become aware due to workplace constraints. 
 
                     For example, learning the users requirements (3.08) may not 
 
                     be possible for a junior software engineer on a team project. 
 
                     Company policies and procedures may be quite adequate and 
 
                     proper, but conflict with this code. </p>
 
                   <p>This involves the following clauses: 1.07, 3.05, 3.06, 3.07, 
 
                     3.08, 3.09, 3.10, 3.13, 3.14. Military software is designed 
 
                     to be unsafe and 93diminish the quality of life for the target 
 
                     (1.03) - does this mean that a software engineer working for 
 
                     a defense contractor is automatically unethical? </p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: To summarize: this reads like a nice 
 
                     academic exercise that is devoid of contact with the reality 
 
                     of many working software engineers. The clauses do contain 
 
                     good things to think about, though no one is likely to be 
 
                     able to think about all 79 of them very often.==================R. 
 
                     Thank you for your comments&#8220;Public Interest&#8221; is 
 
                     used in most engineering codes to designate the health, safety,

                   <p> As with many concepts, there are gray areas. But &#8220;public 
 
                     interest&#8221; is clear in many other cases, such as, it 
 
                     would not be in the public interest to fail to test nuclear 
 
                     reactor software.We use a natural language which has some 
 
                     built in gray areas. The existence of some gray areas does 
 
                     not mean that there are no areas where decisions are clear. 
 
                     In making ethical decisions there are many clear issues which 
 
                     are black or white. In those gray areas we have to use our 
 
                     best judgement. The preamble gives some guidance for working 
 
                     through the gray areas. Making ethical decisions is not an 
 
                     algorithmic science. A code provides heuristics for ethical 
 
                     decision making.Your concern about military software has been

                   <p>Comments: Principle 2: The software engineer is already enjoined 
 
                     to act consistent with the public interest in principle 1; 
 
                     it0D is counterproductive to repeat the phrase in principle 
 
                     2. I most strongly recommend that the statement of principle 
 
                     2 be more succinct by dropping the final &quot;consistent 
 
                     with the public interest.&quot; However I would not withhold 
 
                     an affirmative vote based on the wording of this principle. 
 
                     A 1.08: I disagree that an ethical &quot;software engineer 
 
                     shall&quot; &quot;Volunteer professional skills to good causes..&quot; 
 
                     Encouraged, yes, but not required. (The second phrase is already 
 
                     embodied in 6.02, so this entire clause may be dropped.) I 
 
                     must vote negative unless this is changed or removed. 3.06 
 
                     requires following industry standards only excepting technical 
 
                     justifications (improvement, I assume). </p>
 
                   <p>Either the clause should allow! Economic as well as technical 
 
                     justifications, or it should be phrased as &quot;only when 
 
                     justified.&quot; In the extreme, the whole phrase &quot;departing 
 
                     from these only when technically justified&quot; may be dropped 
 
                     since it is conditioned on &quot;as appropriate.&quot; I will 
 
                     vote affirmative regardless of this clause. 6.06 I am very 
 
                     concerned that this gives the impression that Software Engineers 
 
                     are free to place their personal judgment of the public interest 
 
                     above obedience to the law. The crisis of confidence in the 
 
                     US Clinton and Nixon administrations came when well meaning 
 
                     and powerful people thought they were above the law. As it 
 
                     is, the statement is conditioned by the opening &quot;as appropriate.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p> I cannot overstress how strongly I feel about this, but 
 
                     will not withhold an affirmative vote based on this clause. 
 
                     7.02: I believe a software engineer can refuse to &quot;assist 
 
                     colle!agues in professional development&quot; and still be 
 
                     ethical. The pressures of making a living and supporting a 
 
                     family are enough without requiring dontating time and energy 
 
                     to colleagues. I agree that SE's should be encour- aged to 
 
                     help colleagues develop, but not required. I must vote negative 
 
                     unless this clause is changed or removed. 4. Additional Comments 
 
                     1.03: drop &quot;harm the environment&quot; This should be 
 
                     understood0D in the term &quot;quality of life.&quot; SE's 
 
                     have enough to do without trying to be environmental experts, 
 
                     too. The phrase is acceptable in 1.04 because that clause 
 
                     doesn't refer to &quot;quality of life&quot; and only requires 
 
                     an SE to &quot;disclose&quot; danger not (implicitly) to prevent 
 
                     it by with- holding approval, as 1.03 requires. 3.04 is essentially 
 
                     a duplicate of 2.01. Remove 3.04 to have a shorter code. 3.07: 
 
                     Strive to *sufficiently* under!stand the spec...</p>
 
                   <p> It is unreasonable to expect SE's to *fully* understand 
 
                     the large and complex specs which occur today. 3.09 is essentially 
 
                     a duplicate of 5.09 and has more to do with the process (management29 
 
                     than the product. Drop this clause to shorten the code. 3.10 
 
                     Verification, or at least validation, should be mentioned 
 
                     in addition to the other assurance methods. 5.04 Assign work 
 
                     only after taking into account ... Please soften it since 
 
                     scheduling may require assigning people to tasks which do 
 
                     not advance their education or experience. Drop the &quot;only&quot; 
 
                     qualifier. 5.05 Instead of a &quot;risk&quot; assessment, 
 
                     I think it would be more appropriate to provide an uncertainty 
 
                     assessment.0D 5.07: drop &quot;and just&quot; A software engineer 
 
                     may be ethical even when not working for justice in the world. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>The &quot;fair&quot; qualifier is sufficient. 6.08A It is 
 
                     too strong to require all software engineers to *take* responsibility 
 
                     for error management. That may fall to someone else. I suggest 
 
                     the phrasing Accept responsibility for ... 8.01 As with 3.10, 
 
                     please add verification and/or validation to the list of techniques.

                     to human beings, not documents. I suggest &quot;well-written&quot; 
 
                     or &quot;clear&quot; instead.0D 8.07 This clause is already 
 
                     covered by 5.11 and 7.01. Don't repeat it here -- keep the 
 
                     code short. 8.08 This is a near-duplicate of 6.11; remove 
 
                     it for the sake of brevity. </p>

                     objections. It is not respectful enough of confidential information 
 
                     as currently written. Suggested wording: Keep private any 
 
                     confidential information gained in their professional work, 
 
                     unless such confidentiality is not consistent with the public

                     if in the software engineer's opinion...0D Section 5.03 Comment: 
 
                     This is the second of my two objections. Sections 3.12 and 
 
                     3.13 require software engineers to respect the privacy of 
 
                     those whose personal information they are working with. However, 
 
                     there is no corresponding requirement for management. Section 
 
                     5.11 does notD adequately handle this beca!use staff might 
 
                     not have enough information to realize that they are not respecting 
 
                     other privacy, so staff would not be in violation of 3.12 
 
                     so management would not be in violation of 5.11. </p>
 
                   <p>This is a picky point, but I feel that we need to be more 
 
                     assertive. A different way that this might be handled is to 
 
                     change 5.11 so that it requres management to provide all necessary 
 
                     information to staff so that the spirit of the code is not 
 
                     violated2C but what I am looking for is an assertion that 
 
                     management must actively work to support the spirit of the 
 
                     code, not just do things to keep staff from violating the 
 
                     code. Suggested wording: Ensure that software engineers know 
 
                     the employer's policies and procedures for protecting and 
 
                     disclosing passwords, files, and other information that is 
 
                     confidential to the employer or confidential to others and 
 
                     held in the trust of the employer. </p>
 
                   <p>Section 6!..12 Comment: While I wouldn't vote against the 
 
                     code because of this, I feel that as worded it tells the professional 
 
                     that if you don't think that anyone would do anything, then 
 
                     don't bother telling anyone. This is just an analog of the 
 
                     halting problem. I would drop &quot;ineffective&quot; from 
 
                     the wording. Suggested wording: Express concerns to the people 
 
                     involved when significant violations of this Code are detected 
 
                     unless this is impossible or dangerous. Sections 7.02 and/or 
 
                     7.07 Comment: Minor point that I do not hold against the code, 
 
                     but I would like to see that Professionalism calls for professionals 
 
                     to actively help each other. Suggested wording for 7.02: Assist 
 
                     colleagues in professional development. This includes volunteering 
 
                     information that colleagues need to successfully complete 
 
                     their tasks. Suggested wording for 7.07: Not unfairly inte!rvene

                     by a colleague to do his or her job; however, concern for

                     issues about which I am still concerned. One is the lack of 
 
                     any refer- ence to enforcement. The other is the use, in the 
 
                     Preamble, of language which equates professionalism with moral 
 
                     absolutism. As I said in my original critique: Because a code 
 
                     of ethics is about expectations rather than abstract notions 
 
                     of good and bad, I would rewrite the Preamble to eliminate 
 
                     vague references to &quot;good.&quot; This is not, after all, 
 
                     a doctrinal creed for a relig- ious body, but a document reflecting 
 
                     the current state A of informed thought about optimal practices 
 
                     in the field of software engineering. </p>
 
                   <p>We should make it clear to the public -- and no less to our 
 
                     own colleagues -- ! that compliance with the code is not a 
 
                     matter of moral- ity, but a matter of professionalism carrying 
 
                     explicit assurances to the public and explicit consequences 
 
                     for violators. I think that both my remaining concerns could 
 
                     be addressed by rewriting the first paragraph of the Preamble, 
 
                     as follows: Computers have a central and growing role in commerce, 
 
                     industry, government, medicine, education, entertainment and 
 
                     society at large. Those who contribute, by direct participation 
 
                     or by teaching, to the analysis, specification, designC development, 
 
                     maintenance and testing of software have a significant impact 
 
                     on the lives of others. </p>
 
                   <p>To ensure, as much as possible, that all members of society 
 
                     will view that impact as a positive one, software engineers 
 
                     accept an obligation to make software engi- neering a respected 
 
                     profession. Accordingly, softwa!re engineers shall adhere 
 
                     to the following Code of Ethics and Professional0D Practice, 
 
                     and all organizations subscribing to the code shall enforce 
 
                     it by means of appropriate recognitions and sanctions. By 
 
                     mentioning enforcement in the Preamble, we make a firm statement 
 
                     that we, as a profession, intend to regulate our own members. 
 
                     Such self-regulation is an essential characteristic of the 
 
                     professions.</p>
 
                   <p> Again quoting from my original communication: This is ... 
 
                     difficult and often thankless work, but it's necessary if 
 
                     organizations like ACM and IEEE/CS are to become true governing 
 
                     bodies of the profession. The alternative -- governmental 
 
                     certification and li- censing -- is far worse, and I'm convinced 
 
                     that the time is fast approaching when we will have to demon- 
 
                     strate the ability to govern ourselves or be subjected to 
 
                     the heavy hand! of Big Brother. A reference to enforcement 
 
                     in the Preamble isC therefore, a step in the right direction. 
 
                     Standing by itself, however, it leaves unanswered many thorny 
 
                     procedural questions. That is why AI originally suggested 
 
                     a detailed description of the relation- ship between practitioners 
 
                     and professional organizations: If a code of ethics is to 
 
                     have any meaning at all, it must offer remedies to people 
 
                     who believe it has been violated, and the only appropriate 
 
                     way to claim such remedies is to appeal to the authority which 
 
                     promul- gated the code. In this case, such an appeal would 
 
                     be made to ACM, IEEE/CS, or another professional society subscribing 
 
                     to the code. </p>
 
                   <p>The disciplinary tools at the disposal of such societies 
 
                     range from warnings and rep- rimands to suspension or expulsion. 
 
                     Organizations use these tools, a!nd subscribe to codes of 
 
                     ethics, because they seek to assure the public that their 
 
                     members will act in certain ways, and that those who do not 
 
                     will lose their standing as members. Such assurances are the 
 
                     alternative to governmental regulation.</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: N Enforcement is not addressed in the 
 
                     body of the Code. The ACM has a procedure for enforcing their 
 
                     Code which is a bylaw of the organization. This Code may be 
 
                     approved by the ACM and the IEEE-CS at which time the mechanisms 
 
                     for enforcement can be addressed. Texas is licensing Software 
 
                     Engineers, but (at the moment) they are not required to adhere 
 
                     to a particular society&#8217;s code of ethics. </p>

                   <p>Comments: Short Version, paragraph 5 - I need to understand 
 
                     the way that this standard is going to be &quot;levied&quot; 
 
                     on people. Especially in reference to this paragraph and levying 
 
                     this requirement on management who probably are not members 
 
                     of IEEE/ACM. Full Version APara 2.06 - Need to define (or 
 
                     remove from this sentence) the words &quot;too expensive.&quot; 
 
                     We should not be putting our professional staffs on the hook 
 
                     to &quot;too expensive&quot; requirement. In the eye of some 
 
                     people the space program is too expensive, but I would not 
 
                     want to get wrapped around the axles trying to justify it 
 
                     at the worker level. 3.01 Does &quot;the public&quot; really 
 
                     apply here? Is it the responsibility of the engineer to identify 
 
                     trade offs to the public at large? </p>
 
                   <p>Too many political adgendas are possible if we leave this 
 
                     statement. 3.04 Need to add &quot;training&quot; along with 
 
                     education, experi!ence, etc. Training is significantly different 
 
                     from the others. 4.04 Change the last part of the sentence 
 
                     to read &quot;... or other illegal/improper financial practices.&quot; 
 
                     5.04 Training again needs to be added. (See comments to 3.04.) 
 
                     5.05 Need to add quality to this statement. Statement should 
 
                     read something like, &quot;... cost, scheduling, quality, 
 
                     personnel, ....&quot; 6.06 Is this statement meant as policies 
 
                     and procedures, or as law. This may not be applicable if law. 
 
                     Does the engineer make decisions of law or public interest, 
 
                     only in a case of emergency. Otherwise the engineer should 
 
                     not be allowed to violate the law. Just because the engineer 
 
                     believes that the task is &quot;inconsistent with public interest&quot; 
 
                     cannot let allow the engineer to violate the law. 6.12 This 
 
                     sentence should end as &quot;... violations of this Code are 
 
                     detected.&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>The !rest of the sentence must be deleted. This is not an 
 
                     option.</p>

                     6.12 and 6.13 are meant to work together. They provide the 
 
                     description of when whistle blowing is justified. The clause 
 
                     on 6.12 indicates when it is necessary to go to a a step higher 
 
                     in reporting. </p>
 
                   <p>Clause 6.13 says- If you can&#8217;t find the responsible 
 
                     people, or it is evident that dealing with them is either 
 
                     dangerous or may make the situation worse, THEN follow 6.13 
 
                     and report to other authorities. This has been clarified by

                   <p>Comments: Significant Comments: D The use of the word &quot;ensure&quot; 
 
                     in Clauses 3.02, 3.04, 3.05, 3.08, 3.09, 3.10, 3.11, 5.01, 
 
                     5.02, 5.03, 5.05, 5.09 sets up a requirement that may be beyond 
 
                     the individual's capacity to fulfill, given that software 
 
                     engineering is predominately a team activity. Replacing the 
 
                     word &quot;ensure2 with &quot;ensure, within the authority 
 
                     and resources available to them, that&quot; would suffice, 
 
                     but it is somewhat verbose - I'd be heppy with any equivalent. 
 
                     Note, by the way, that the responsibility to identify and 
 
                     communicate about the things one can't fix is covered already 
 
                     in 6.12 </p>
 
                   <p>In Clause 6.102C the reputation for unethical behaviour is 
 
                     not a sufficient basis; suggest 22Avoid associations with 
 
                     business and organisations which act in conflict with this 
 
                     code.&quot; In clause 6.12, it is important to &quot;express 
 
                     concern to the people involved&quot; even if it! is thought 
 
                     to be ineffective. They have, after all, a right to be advised 
 
                     that they are, in our opinion, doing wrong. The wording would 
 
                     be more appropriate as &quot;...unless this is iompossible, 
 
                     counter-productive or dangerous&quot;D In Clause 8.02, the 
 
                     use of theterm &quot;reasonable&quot; will create difficulty 
 
                     - what is reasonable to one person is not necessarily so to 
 
                     another. </p>

                     produce safe, reliable and useful software&quot;. Note that, 
 
                     if we accept the definition of quality as &quot;fitness for 
 
                     purpose&quot;, the word &quot;quality&quot; is redundant in 
 
                     the original clause.</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: Editorial Comments: Firstly, thanks 
 
                     to all involved, directily or indirectly, in production of 
 
                     the Code. As a member of the profession, I appreciate the 
 
                     effort that you have applied. Clause 3.04 is not about product, 
 
                     but practice. It should be moved under Principle 6, or perehaps 
 
                     under Principle 2 ! Clause 4.01 effectively duplicates Clause 
 
                     1.02 - it would be better deleted.0D Clause 4.404 does not 
 
                     address judgement - it would be better placed in Principle 
 
                     6, or perhaps in Principle 2. In Clause 4.06 &quot;... in 
 
                     a governmental or professional body...&quot; seems too narrow; 
 
                     &quot;...in any public body ...2 would be preferrable. In 
 
                     Clause 6.01 &quot;... acting ethically.&quot; would be better 
 
                     as &quot;... acting in accordance with this code.&quot; Clause 
 
                     6.04 would be better placed under Principle 7 Clause 6.06 
 
                     would be better placed under Principle 1. </p>
 
                   <p>Clauses 6.11 would be better deleted - it states something 
 
                     that is not specific to the PROFESSION principle, and which 
 
                     is already stated in the second paragraph of the Preamble. 
 
                     Clause 7.08 would be better placed under Principle 6. Clause 
 
                     8.07 would be better placed under Principle 6. Clause 8.08 
 
                     would be better deleted; it is more relevant to Principle 
 
                     6, but effectively duplicates Clau!se 6.11, and is addressed 
 
                     in the second paragraph of the Preamble anyway. ARESPONSES1.R 
 
                     1 would require modification of every clause. The use of the 
 
                     word &#8216;appropriate&#8217; in the principle was intended 
 
                     to cover different situations like working on teams. Teams 
 
                     are also specifically mentioned in the full preamble- the 
 
                     code applies to teams and individuals within teams as well 
 
                     as individuals working alone.2.A.6.10 disreputable replaced

                     rest of the team. People aren't perfect. What if the opinion 
 
                     was wrong at the end of the project... What if nothing is 
 
                     said just for political reasons... We can't assume that everyone 
 
                     works in the perfect politically-free environment. Secondly, 
 
                     management must assume the responsibility to support and promote 
 
                     career development for software engineers.</p>
 
                   <p> What good is peer support if there is no management support? 
 
                     Management must also promote and support continuous improvement. 
 
                     Where would this field be today if all managers supported 
 
                     this? We might have been even further advanced. Optional--I 
 
                     would merge the profess!ional section with the self section 
 
                     since there is not a clear distinction between the two sections.

                   <p>Additional Comments: R-If our responsibility is to the public 
 
                     then we are being responsible to the team when we report the 
 
                     likelihood of failure. That report may be just the thing to 
 
                     turn the project around. We have tried to specifically address 
 
                     management&#8217;s responsibility to staff. N-We agree that

                   <p>Comments: Comments are as follows: Preamble, second paragraph, 
 
                     first sentence: &quot;Software engineers shall commit themselves 
 
                     to making analysis, specification, design, development, testing, 
 
                     and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession.&quot; 
 
                     Analysis, prior to specification, implies requirements analysis. 
 
                     Requirements are a major source of errors forthe lack of objective 
 
                     acceptance criteria for completeness. Furthermore, in many 
 
                     applications, deep domain knowledge is required to conduct 
 
                     analysis and generate requirements. </p>
 
                   <p>Given the broad scope of software applications, it is not 
 
                     logical to expect the software engineer to have deep domain 
 
                     knowledge to conduct all of the requirements analyses. A statement 
 
                     to address this point is needed in the preamble. Such a statement 
 
                     would then be consistent with several existing statements 
 
                     in the document that attempt to establissh a biundary: &quot;3!.04 
 
                     Ensure that they are qualified .... &quot;3.08 &quot;satisfies 
 
                     user's requirements....,&quot; implies software engineers 
 
                     not responsible for the requirements. &quot;3.07 Strives to 
 
                     fully understand specifications.....&quot; &quot;7.08 In situations 
 
                     outside area of competence, call upon the opinion of other 
 
                     professionals....,&quot; ; statements on requirements analysis 
 
                     would help here. </p>
 
                   <p>Additional comments: The document in its current form is 
 
                     not definitive in the area of requirements analysis and the 
 
                     responsibility of the software engineer. My negative vote 
 
                     is resolved when a clear deifnitive boundary of responsibility 
 
                     on the subject of requirements analysis is established.RESPONSES=R. 
 
                     There is no clear basic boundary. Such a clear delineation 
 
                     as you request is not available as an industry standard or 
 
                     available in academic circles. We cannot make up such a boundary. 
 
                     Enabling a workable boundary in a specific project requires 
 
                     professional judgement. For someone who tried to extend the 
 
                     boundary see Nancy Leveson&#8217;s work.</p>

                   <p>Comments: Nearly all 'Principles' sections include the words 
 
                     &quot;as appropriate&quot;. While the intent is to not force 
 
                     engineers to do things that don't apply in a given situation, 
 
                     there are some portions of each Principle which should not 
 
                     be 'optional'. The words &quot;as appropriate&quot; imply 
 
                     such optionality. To change my vote to Afirmative, please 
 
                     separate the tenets of each section into non-optional and 
 
                     'as apropriate or optional'. Using only Principle 1 as an 
 
                     example, the result might look like:0D &quot;Principle 1 PUBLIC 
 
                     Software ......shall: 1.01 --- 1.03 --- 1.04 --- 1.06 --- 
 
                     1.08 --- and shall, as appropriate3A 1.02 --- 1.05 --- 1.07 
 
                     ---&quot; In this way, we define absolute ethics and show 
 
                     additional ethical concerns which might not be involved in 
 
                     all cases. I will leave the choice of 'absolutes' to the task 
 
                     force, but expect to see! some 'always appropriate' elements 
 
                     specified in each Principle section.</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: R. The phrase &#8220; as appropriate&#8221; 
 
                     does not mean &#8220;Optional&#8221;. &#8220;As appropriate&#8221; 
 
                     means it requires some judgement from the professional software 
 
                     engineer as to whether it is appropriate. If it is appropriate 
 
                     , then it is not &#8220;Optional&#8221;. </p>

                   <p>Comments: While I find the 8 principles of the proposed SWE 
 
                     Code of Ethics more or less acceptable, there are at least 
 
                     two short2C simple, and to the point codes of ethics that 
 
                     are quite suitable for software engineers; there is no real 
 
                     need to have a different, separate code: D The Code of Ethics 
 
                     of the Quality Assurance Institute in Orlando FL (http://www.qaiusa.com/certification/code-of-ethics.html) 
 
                     and D The IEEE Code of Ethics. Both codes cover everything 
 
                     a professional should need to be concerned about and say it 
 
                     concisely. My understanding is that the proposed SWE code 
 
                     of ethics is intended to be part of a package of &quot;Software 
 
                     Engineering as a Profession.&quot; It is much too detailed 
 
                     to be useful or usable. I am trying to understand it in its 
 
                     intended context. </p>
 
                   <p>QUESTIONS: 1. To whom does this code apply? Those who pass 
 
                     some licensing or cert!ification exam? 2. Then, who takes 
 
                     the exam? Experienced people already in the field? Fresh graduates 
 
                     of college or other training programs? D 3. Is this intended 
 
                     for managers? Or, the lowest level programmer, who may not 
 
                     even have an idea of project costs or many other DETAILS specified 
 
                     in the code? 4. I believe I have always behaved ethically, 
 
                     but as a new college graduate, I would never have considered 
 
                     or been involved in most of the issues addressed by these 
 
                     details. I maintain that as a young person I wouldn't have 
 
                     had any idea what the details of the proposed code imply. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>Are today's young people that much more sophisticated, and 
 
                     do they get exposed to all the details of every project as 
 
                     soon as they join a company?</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: But, the IEEE Code, yes, I believe I 
 
                     live by those, and have done so all my life. 6. What are the 
 
                     consequences of NOT following this code? Removal of one's 
 
                     license or certif!ication? In what body would a removal decision 
 
                     reside? 7. Some points go beyond the domain of professional 
 
                     ethics and intrude on one's private life. Example: While we 
 
                     may all believe that doing voluntary is something we should 
 
                     do, it certainly is outside a professional code to mandate 
 
                     voluntary work2C as stated in 1.08. Then, that work would 
 
                     not be &quot;voluntary!&quot; Please, simplify this code, 
 
                     or reduce it to strictly the 8 principles. Preferably, use 
 
                     either of the two existing codes identified in this ballot. 
 
                     0AR. Thank you for your comments. For Enforcement and Licensing

                   <p>Comments: 1.02 &quot;public good&quot; is a vague phrase 
 
                     that can mean almost anything. The code gives no guidance 
 
                     for understanding this crucial term. 1.07 &quot;Physical disabilities&quot; 
 
                     are not relevant, or at least are not clearly explained. 2.05 
 
                     As above, &quot;consistent with the public good&quot; is too 
 
                     vague. 6.06 This is a major problem. As written, it is an 
 
                     invitation to anarchy, again because the code provides no 
 
                     guidance - no ethical context - for judging when the public 
 
                     interest is at stake. 6.12 At what point does the engineer 
 
                     put his pragmatic personal interest above the common good? 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>If he/she is to do so here, why not elsewhere in the code? 
 
                     What singles out this particular instruction for a self-interest 
 
                     exception? I have two general objections: As the particulars 
 
                     above show, the code is insufficiently precise in my opinion 
 
                     to offer real guidance to software professionals in facing 
 
                     a!nd resolving ethical dilemmas. The code in fact creates 
 
                     more dilemmas than it solves because it is so vague. Secondly, 
 
                     and related to the first, is that with few exceptions this 
 
                     could be a code for any profession. There is little in here 
 
                     that speaks to the particular ethical problems faced by computer 
 
                     professionals - those dealing with the nature of the computer 
 
                     itself, its distancing effect on its users, its ability to 
 
                     malform data, its potential for invasions of privacy, and 
 
                     so forth. </p>
 
                   <p>I feel that to be useful to software engineers (as opposed 
 
                     to professionals in general), the code must address and give 
 
                     guidance on those issues of ethics that are unique to the 
 
                     computer field.</p>
 
                   <p>Additional comments: N.The common use of public good in engineering 
 
                     codes of ethics refers to the health, safety and welfare of 
 
                     the public.R. 6.12 is not a special self -interest clause. 
 
                     6.12 and 6.13 work together. If talking to the people involved 
 
                     doesn&#8217;t work then 6.13 take it up the ladder. See response 
 
                     to comment [68].Code addresses issues of security, privacy, 
 
                     confidentiality, security and file protection etc. For specific 
 
                     SE issues see for example 1.04, 1.05,the whole of section 
 
                     3, 5.03, 8.03 etc. </p>

                     ALWAYS or place in each aspiration. Rationale: These are all

                     just the first promotes inconsistency in application.0D Aspiration

                     strongly suggest splitting Aspiration 3 into two parts: Professional 
 
                     standards (highest professional standards) and ethical approach 
 
                     (as in 5). It is not just management that should be held to 
 
                     an ethical standard. 3.05 is shallow - ensure a methodology 
 
                     doesn't say anything. Ensure an appropriate methodology is 
 
                     consistently applied is more forthright.</p>

                     is going to be exceedingly difficult for us to comply with,

                     representation of the membership) to allow us to continue 
 
                     to participate in standards activities. Their actions are 
 
                     inconsistent with ethical behavior on the part of responsible 
 
                     software engineers.0D 8.02 Insert &quot;usable,&quot; after

                   <p>Things like usability, privacy, security, safety, that relate 
 
                     to the product itself and its intended use should be addressed 
 
                     explicitly. For example, is software that allows identity 
 
                     theft or password snooping ethicaly correct software that 
 
                     a software engineer should be developing? What about trap 
 
                     doors or back doors? 3.03 starts to get at some of this, but

                   <p>Comments: CHANGES REQUIRED FOR MY APPROVAL OF THIS CODEA 
 
                     3.06. Work to follow industry standards when available that 
 
                     are most appropriate for the task at hand, departing from 
 
                     these only when technically justified. I object to the use 
 
                     of the word &quot;technically&quot; in this clause. There 
 
                     are other justifications for departing from a standard, including 
 
                     economic cost/benefit tradeoffs for the customer, marketing 
 
                     or positioning justification for the employer, etc. Open standards 
 
                     and Ethics are separate issues, and a code of ethics and professional 
 
                     behavior is not a place to push open standards. Suggested 
 
                     re-wording: &quot;Work to follow industry standards when available 
 
                     that are most appropriate for the task at hand, departing 
 
                     from these only when justified.&quot; 3.08. Ensure that specifications 
 
                     for software on which they work have been well documented, 
 
                     satisfy the users' requirements, and hav!e the appropriate 
 
                     approvals. Documentation of the specification is not always 
 
                     requred, depending on the project or level of granularity 
 
                     of the feature involved. In addition, the specification should 
 
                     satisfy the requirements of the client, which are a complex 
 
                     mix of end-user requirements, system administrator requirements, 
 
                     marketing requirements, etc. </p>
 
                   <p>Also, there are customers of the specification who are not 
 
                     necessarily customers of the final product. These include 
 
                     those writing documentation, sales staff, support staffC developers, 
 
                     etc. Suggested re-wording: &quot;Ensure that specifications 
 
                     for software on which they work have been appropriately documented, 
 
                     satisfy the customers' requirements, and have the appropriate 
 
                     approvals.&quot; A 6.10. Avoid associations with disreputable 
 
                     businesses and organizations. What does &quot;disreputable&quot; 
 
                     mean? There is no absolute standard for disrepute, so how 
 
                     can we !hold someone to a clause that presumes such a standard? 
 
                     To some, Microsoft is disreputable these days, yet I feel 
 
                     completely ethically justified in everything I do working 
 
                     here. How about changing this to: &quot;Avoid associations 
 
                     with businesses and organizations that the software engineer 
 
                     judges to be disreputable.&quot; EDITORIAL COMMENTS, NOT REQUIRED 
 
                     FOR MY APPROVAL OF THIS CODE: 1.04. Disclose to appropriate 
 
                     persons or authorities any actual or potential danger to the 
 
                     user, the public, or the environment, that they reasonably 
 
                     believe to be associated with software or related documents. 
 
                     As we all know, software that ships contains bugs. </p>
 
                   <p>Some bugs are known at the time of shipment. Whether to ship 
 
                     the software with the bugs involves trade-offs where the benefit 
 
                     of shipping is weighed against the benefit of slipping the 
 
                     schedule to fix the bug, and the corresponding risks of introducing 
 
                     new and possibly unknow!n bugs in the process. Software engineers 
 
                     use their judgement to make the appropriate trade-offs, and 
 
                     although every effort is made to eliminate bugs that could 
 
                     cause &quot;potential danger&quot;, some bugs known to have 
 
                     this potential inevitably remain in the product. Generally, 
 
                     the decision to leave such a bug in the product is a result 
 
                     of the vanishingly small chance of encountering the bug. In 
 
                     some cases, communicating the bug could cause more harm than 
 
                     not communicating it. For example, a bug that potentially 
 
                     causes data loss can be devastating to a customer, but it 
 
                     must be weighed against the cumulative benefit the customer 
 
                     will receive from using the software in the case where the 
 
                     product works properly.</p>
 
                   <p> I would like to see a more specific definition of &quot;actual 
 
                     or potential danger,&quot; and a caveat that the consequences 
 
                     of disclosing the defect should be weighed against the consequences 
 
                     of not disclosing the defect.</p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: O.3.06 rewording to &#8220;only when 
 
                     justified&#8221; opens the door to any unethical justification.

                     to play golf today justifies my not testing the product. We

                   <p>Comments: Comment: Generally, the document is very good and 
 
                     reflects the professional views I endorse. I particularly0D 
 
                     like Full Version Preamble paragraph 4. Significant: 2.02 
 
                     Unclear - what is unethically obtained software? I cannot 
 
                     endorse this principle in general if it refers to the general 
 
                     licencing / piracy-for-use-not-resale issue. It requires an 
 
                     &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; modifier and, as such, 
 
                     is subsumed in 6.06. Therefore omit it as in no other 0Aparagraphs 
 
                     of principles are instances of 6.06 spelled out. My reasoning: 
 
                     there are circumstances when using unlicenced software is 
 
                     justified ethically even though it might not be illegal. Therefore 
 
                     the professional code should not exclude it categorically. 
 
                     Example 1: the industry argument that all copied software 
 
                     is lost revenue is, of course, self serving. If you cannot 
 
                     afford the !software you would not buy it, you would merely 
 
                     go without. In such circumstances, copying software does not 
 
                     negatively affect intellectual property holders. No harm done. 
 
                     Not using it could go against public good. For example, a 
 
                     one person startup operation might not have enough capital. 
 
                     Failing to startup is negative, economically, and, therefore, 
 
                     not good forD society. </p>
 
                   <p>Ethics suggests that, once one can afford it, one should 
 
                     become licenced. Meanwhile you are illegal but doing good 
 
                     and will become a future paying software consumer. The key 
 
                     to such arguments as this is the fundamental difference between 
 
                     intellectual property and other property. For goods that, 
 
                     if taken, are no longer available to the owner, no such justification 
 
                     could, generally, be made. With software, if the situation 
 
                     is merely pirate it or do without, then pirating is justified 
 
                     if the public good is better served by havi!ng it rather than 
 
                     not having it. Example 2: it may be difficult or impossible 
 
                     to acquire the SW legally: old versions - Windows 3.x and 
 
                     applications for 4MB machines; DOS applications - may not 
 
                     be available in your local market. This is common in such 
 
                     markets as this one and other countries in Africa. Suppliers 
 
                     are not very informed and supported product range is severely 
 
                     restricted.</p>
 
                   <p> Here, organizational ineffectiveness, poor lines of supply, 
 
                     ineffective or dishonest suppliers, etc, make acquisition 
 
                     of intellectual property products problematic, delayed and, 
 
                     commonly, overpriced. Shall we copy the old software we purchased 
 
                     in the past or simply go without? Example 3: textbooks -- 
 
                     another kind of intellectual property -- commonly DO NOT arrive 
 
                     on time or AT ALL even though they have been contracted for 
 
                     and would be paid for. It may violate copyright to lend photocopies 
 
                     to the students! but is it unethical? Shall the students go 
 
                     uneducated? Shall professional development in the country 
 
                     flag? Example 4: the wording of licence agreements is overly 
 
                     restrictive anyway. </p>
 
                   <p>A private consultant cannot use licenced SW on her office 
 
                     and home computers without paying twice without some ridiculous 
 
                     requirement of deinstalling and reinstalling even though there 
 
                     is no concurrent use! This wording is not in the public interest 
 
                     and non compliance - ie. installing anywhere but limiting 
 
                     concurrent use to number of licences - doesn't seem unethical 
 
                     to me. Example 5: some - most - software is now supplied by 
 
                     monopoly suppliers and users have no choice. Yet there are 
 
                     no regulatory bodies that enforce good service, or price controls, 
 
                     on the monopoly providers. In remote markets, like this one, 
 
                     there is virtually no product support; something that is part 
 
                     of the product price. Sometimes it !is worse than that. A 
 
                     specific example: A bought Visual Basic and it was delivered 
 
                     on many 3.5&quot; diskettes. The diskettes failed so A sent 
 
                     them back to the supplier. Much time passed. Eventually they 
 
                     delivered replacements - on CD, which, at that time A could 
 
                     not use. Has A received what A paid for? </p>
 
                   <p>Should A copy someone else's software? Another specific example: 
 
                     B received 10 Pentium machines with CD installed but no software 
 
                     medium; ie. no installation CDs or diskettes. B was expected 
 
                     to cut B's own 3.5 diskettes - about 35 of them. Another vendor 
 
                     gave B a Windows 95 CD which B subsequently used for *all* 
 
                     of the machines. So, while B had, factory installed, licenced 
 
                     software, B used illegal unlicenced software. Our identity 
 
                     has been protected in both the previous examples. Does the 
 
                     code expect one to ethically follow the exact &quot;legal&quot; 
 
                     licencing arrangements in such situations and! &quot;not knowingly 
 
                     use&quot; &quot;illegal&quot; software? Options in order of 
 
                     preference: 1. Omit 2.02 2. Alternate wording &quot;. . . 
 
                     illegally or unethically, unless, in exceptional circumstances, 
 
                     such avoidance is inconsistent with the public interest.&quot; 
 
                     As I said, 2.02 seems to be subsumed in 6.06. 3. Second alternate 
 
                     wording: &quot;Work to not knowingly use . . .&quot;. It appears 
 
                     that the use of &quot;Work to&quot; in section 3 - eg. 3.12 
 
                     - means &quot;do your best&quot; rather than &quot;thou shalt&quot;. 
 
                     &quot;Privacy&quot; seems to be a topic on which the code 
 
                     takes a ambivalent stand. So it should on licencing. 2.08 
 
                     Reword: &quot;Accept no outside work detrimental to the normal 
 
                     work they perform. . .&quot; </p>
 
                   <p>The work &quot;normal&quot; has been added. Employers often 
 
                     expect IT professionals to work late nights, weekends2C holidays, 
 
                     particularly when late on a contract which often was acquired 
 
                     by low bidding and allowing i!nsufficient resources to complete 
 
                     in normal working hours. Other aspects of this scenario are 
 
                     not ones I wish to take up with respect to ethics but the 
 
                     employer does not have the &quot;ethical&quot; right to insist 
 
                     the employee give up his weekend job. This is a matter of 
 
                     contract negotiation between them. The ethical issue applies 
 
                     only to &quot;normal&quot; working conditions and should 0Abe 
 
                     explicit in the code, given the nature of our profession. 
 
                     Suggestion: 5.13 Add an additional management principle, related 
 
                     to the general principle 8 which addresses the important concept 
 
                     of lifelong learning. We need a principle that management 
 
                     facilitates this practice in the workplace. Perhaps 5.04 is 
 
                     intended to address this but, if so, it is not clear. &quot;5.13 
 
                     Encourage and enable professional development and life long 
 
                     learning.&quot; Renumber items as you see fit. Suggestion: 
 
                     6.10 Reword: &quot;Avoid! unnecessary association with disreputable 
 
                     businesses and organizations.&quot; AThe word &quot;unnecessary&quot; 
 
                     is added. Recall the ideas of detente with the &quot;evil 
 
                     empire&quot; and constructive engagement with the apartheid 
 
                     regime - which was not a good thing but that's another matter. 
 
                     Perhaps &quot;Avoid&quot; is sufficiently non-imperative . 
 
                     . .</p>

                     The fact that work is prepared under one's supervision does 
 
                     not necessarily enable one to be able to &quot;endorse&quot; 
 
                     the work. Such endorsement should only be offered if the remaining 
 
                     portions of the clause hold true, even when supervising such 
 
                     work. In Clause 5.07, qualification should be included since 
 
                     many managers have no control over compensation. We might 
 
                     try something like: &quot;Work to assure fair and just remuneration 
 
                     for all participants, where such factors are within the manager's 
 
                     control.&quot; Non-Binding Content Comments Principles 2 &amp; 
 
                     6 both end with &quot;consistent with the public interest.&quot; 
 
                     Does this need to be explicit? The Preamble to the full version 
 
                     points out that ALL clauses need to be interpreted and used 
 
                     in such a way. Why single out these two Pri!nciples? </p>
 
                   <p>Clause 1.02 provides explicitly for such cross-considerations. 
 
                     I would remove the sub-clauses from Principles 2 &amp; 6. 
 
                     The same should be considered in Clause 2.06. In Clause 4.06, 
 
                     I feel the verb &quot;refuse&quot; is a bit strong. I would 
 
                     prefer &quot;decline.&quot; Editorial Comments The first paragraph 
 
                     of the Preamble of the Short Version actually differentiates 
 
                     the short from full versions and so should not be included 
 
                     in the Preamble of the short. I would move the paragraph up 
 
                     to precede the Short Version heading. The style seems to have 
 
                     been chosen to capitalize Code, Principle, and Clause when 
 
                     self-referencing this document. </p>
 
                   <p>If so, it should be applied more consistently throughout 
 
                     the document. The Preamble to the Full Version is too long. 
 
                     I would insert an additional heading, INTRODUCTION2C after 
 
                     the first paragraph of this Preamble. </p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: The authors have done an exceptional 
 
                     job. My c!omments above are trivial when compared to the amount 
 
                     of work and thought that has obviously gone into this effort. 
 
                     My congratulations and thanks. - Rick BiehlRESPONSESO.4.02 
 
                     4.02 does not say that one is enabled to authorize ALL documents 
 
                     prepared under their supervision. It already says the only 
 
                     work you should endorse is that subset of work prepared under 
 
                     your supervision which you are allowed to endorse.O.5.07 &#8220;as 
 
                     appropriate, offer..&#8221; limits the clause to those who 
 
                     can make salary arrangements.</p>

                   <p>Comments: Comment #1 Binding Principle 4.03 Nowhere in the 
 
                     Code I was able to find examples with the ambiguous wording 
 
                     &quot;such as ... or other ...&quot;. To be coherent with 
 
                     the overall Code, wording as above must be avoided. I suggest 
 
                     to reword the Principle 4.04 as follows: &quot;Avoid financial 
 
                     practices prosecuted from enforced laws&quot;. </p>
 
                   <p>Additional Comments: R.4.04 Thank you for the focusing of 
 
                     4.04 . The intent of 4.04, however, is to eliminate all forms 
 
                     of financial deception, not just deception which also happens 
 
                     to be illegal according to the letter of the law. It is impossible 
 
                     to list all unethical financial deceptions, s we listed a 
 
                     few and opted for &#8220;such as&#8221;. </p>
