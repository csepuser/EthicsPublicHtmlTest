                   <p>====================================================================.</p>
 
                   <p>General Comments:</p>
 
                   <p>It is comprehensive and I did not see anything I would oppose.[46a]</p>
 
                   <p>I generally favor Version 3 of Software Code of Ethics as 
 
                     published in the October 1997 issue of Computer Magazine. 
 
                     [3i]</p>
 
                   <p> This looks like a great effort and I wish you well. [14i]</p>
 
                   <p>My initial reaction was &#8220;major overkill&#8221;, but 
 
                     I was wrong. I like it! I might even call myself a software 
 
                     engineer![38a]</p>
 
                   <p> Three levels</p>
 
                   <p>You identify three levels clearly, but why are three paragraphs 
 
                     in the preamble devoted to it? The clauses are not, as far 
 
                     as I can tell, labeled as corresponding to a particular level. 
 
                     Is the professional supposed to decide whether what level 
 
                     a clause is, then be more insistent (demand) or less insistent 
 
                     (aspire) about doing it? (The verbage in level three includes 
 
                     &quot;aspirational,&quot; so makes it harder to decide how 
 
                     clauses should be classified.) Since this is e?mail rather 
 
                     than a conversation and I may not have communicated clearly, 
 
                     let me restate. Devoting three paragraphs to levels tells 
 
                     me it is important to understand and apply the concepts, but 
 
                     I really can't see how to classify clauses or how I should 
 
                     view or behavior differently with regard to, say, a level 
 
                     three vs. a level one clause. [42a]</p>
 
                   <p>I agree with Leonard that these principles look very familiar. 
 
                     But I think it is very good integration of all ethics principles. 
 
                     My trouble in reading this and understanding it completely 
 
                     is primarily due to the so-called three-level classification 
 
                     of clauses: Aspire, Expect, and Demand. I cannot tell (with 
 
                     ease) which is which. For example, 3.03. Reject bribery. Is 
 
                     it &#8220;Aspire&#8221; (to be human??) or Expect (to be professional) 
 
                     or Demand (good practice)? Not sure if all human &#8220;like&#8221; 
 
                     to reject bribery by the very human nature. We were &#8220;taught&#8221; 
 
                     through our education not to take bribery in this society. 
 
                     It would be a good service to us (educators) to label each 
 
                     clause one of the three levels if our dear authors can sort 
 
                     them out clearly. There are still some typos I guess. Otherwise 
 
                     I am excited about seeing and would love to use it in my course. 
 
                     [5i]</p>
 
                   <p> Code title If reviewing this draft document, the following 
 
                     should be borne in mind: (1) Principles 2-9 are largely derived 
 
                     from existing Code of Ethics from other engineering disciplines. 
 
                     (2) We should ensure Principle 1 in particular and the other 
 
                     principles as necessary are restricted to ethical issues. 
 
                     Those that are primarily technical in nature should be eliminated. 
 
                     DG. This is contrary to the committee interest in professional 
 
                     practices Should we relabel the Code to include the word &#8220;Conduct&#8221; 
 
                     or &#8220;Practice&#8221; e.g. &#8220;Software Engineering 
 
                     Code of Ethics and Professional Practice&#8221;??</p>
 
                   <p> SIZE I suggest you set a goal of reducing the code size 
 
                     to 40% of the draft size! Many of these are not ethical issues 
 
                     and should be deleted. Just because someone thinks its a good 
 
                     idea does not make it an appropriate item for a code of ethics. 
 
                     [22i]</p>
 
                   <p>Too long, too wordy. Can&#8217;t be written on the back of 
 
                     an envelope. [18i] I have no quarrel with the instant of the 
 
                     proposed Code of Ethics or the specific line items. Obviously 
 
                     a lot of thought has gone into it. My comment is that it is 
 
                     so volumous and specific that it loses all its impact. If 
 
                     the Constitution and Bill of Rights were written like this 
 
                     they would fill 500 pages each and there would be 882 rights 
 
                     specifically delineated. I would suggest that after the group 
 
                     reaches a consensus on the individual line items you give 
 
                     it to a writer and ask him/her to reduce it to a single page 
 
                     which summarizes each of the keyword principles in one or 
 
                     two sentences. All the line items should then be put in an 
 
                     appendix. [17i]</p>
 
                   <p>I think it was Lao Tzu who said: &#8220;Where the filial 
 
                     son is highly regarded, the family is in danger. Where the 
 
                     loyal minister is regarded highly, the state is in danger.&#8221; 
 
                     It seems to me that any profession that needs an ethics code 
 
                     on paper with a whopping 82 clauses of blantant obviousness, 
 
                     is in serious danger.[27a]</p>
 
                   <p>The root of my difficulty is, I think, a philosophical one. 
 
                     I believe very strongly that codes like this have to focus 
 
                     on the &quot;spirit of the law&quot;, and not on the &quot;letter 
 
                     of the law&quot;, in order to be effective. This code has 
 
                     chosen to focus largely on the letter of the law. One result 
 
                     is that it is five to ten times longer than it could be. People 
 
                     will be unable and/or unwilling to read it, remember it, and 
 
                     apply it. It reduces ethical principles to legalistic rules 
 
                     and seems thereby to drain the ethical juice right out of 
 
                     the concepts. These are not words that elevate the soul. As 
 
                     I went through the numbered sentences, I found some that I 
 
                     violate frequently though I consider that I act ethically; 
 
                     some whose recommendations I would consider unethical; some 
 
                     that are so morally neutral that I wonder what they are doing 
 
                     in an ethics document; some that are inconsistent with other 
 
                     sentences; some that appear to have huge loopholes; some that 
 
                     are ambiguous; and some that I just plain cannot understand 
 
                     the interpretation or intent of. By the time I was halfway 
 
                     through I could often no longer tell whether I agreed or disagreed 
 
                     ethically with any particular numbered sentence.</p>
 
                   <p> Somewhere this Code went badly off the tracks. I would much 
 
                     prefer to see a number of short, pithy, and inspiring statements 
 
                     of principle; plus perhaps one short &quot;in particular&quot; 
 
                     sentence per principle. Nothing further. Find one person with 
 
                     a keen sense of ethics and a winning prose style and ask them 
 
                     to write the Code. I would take as a goal that the entire 
 
                     Code should be able to be typed comfortably on a single sheet 
 
                     of paper. About 200 to 400 words. I'm sorry to have been so 
 
                     negative, but I'm afraid that is my reaction. It's not a Code 
 
                     of Ethics that I could apply in my professional life. [41a]</p>
 
                   <p>While I applaud the effort to create the code, I am extremely 
 
                     concerned that the current document is a &quot;kitchen sink&quot; 
 
                     version. In fact, it seems to have the sinks from all the 
 
                     bathrooms too! If we want folk to actually pay attention to 
 
                     a code of ethics, it MUST fit on one page of large type. Personally, 
 
                     I'd prefer a 1 pager supported with a web?available discussion 
 
                     document providing lots of example situations, well-indexed, 
 
                     providing &quot;situations&quot; where each of the points 
 
                     addressed in the questionnaire are illustrated. People relate 
 
                     to real?world situations that allow for thought and dialogue 
 
                     about the genuine difficulties raised by the pressures of 
 
                     budget and personnel constraints. Such situations are rarely 
 
                     clear-cut; what appears to be an obvious choice of good over 
 
                     evil in a code of ethics becomes a too?quick reaction to a 
 
                     perceived emergency. [47a]</p>
 
                   <p> Make it an SE Code There are many related practices (such 
 
                     as hiring practices) that impact our profession. But these 
 
                     are not unique to our profession. Focus more on things unique 
 
                     to software engineering. [19i]</p>
 
                   <p>My suggestion is to reduce the list of dozens, down to 7 
 
                     + or - 2. Focus on things like treatment of shareware and 
 
                     association with virus&#8217; that are very critical to the 
 
                     world&#8217;s impression of our profession. While communicating 
 
                     with our customers and developing good process is very important, 
 
                     it is to vague to be useful. Besides we have other sources 
 
                     for this input (like SEI). [19i]</p>
 
                   <p>This code is very thorough, but it seems to focus on testing 
 
                     to remove software defects rather than designing and building 
 
                     software without defects (quality assurance). I would like 
 
                     to see an appropriate balance of software quality assurance 
 
                     testing within this code.[16a]</p>
 
                   <p></p>
 
                   <p>Ethics is poop Your code has delusion of scope of authority, 
 
                     that far exceeds normal work environment. Much calls for subjective 
 
                     judgement and how will code be administered. I don&#8217;t

                   <p>Enforcement</p>
 
                   <p> I am glad that the Code of Ethics is being revisited, and 
 
                     its scope expanded beyond the ACM. This is, I know, difficult 
 
                     and often thankless work, but it's necessary if organizations 
 
                     like ACM and IEEE/CS are to become true governing bodies of 
 
                     the profession. The alternative ?? governmental certification 
 
                     and licensing ?? is far worse, and I'm convinced that the 
 
                     time is fast approaching when we will have to demonstrate 
 
                     the ability to govern ourselves or be subjected to the heavy 
 
                     hand of Big Brother. That said, I have deep-seated reservations 
 
                     about several provisions of the current Draft, and I hope 
 
                     that the Executive Committee contemplates a complete rework 
 
                     after comments are re?ceived. In its current state, this Draft 
 
                     is nowhere near ready for release. Perhaps my most fundamental 
 
                     reservation has to do with the fact that no enforcement mechanisms 
 
                     are prescribed. As the Pre?amble suggests, ethics is not an 
 
                     exact science; it's a subjective matter, and no enumeration 
 
                     of &quot;principles&quot; can transform it into an objective 
 
                     discipline. Codes of ethics are not statements on the nature 
 
                     of abstract &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;; rather, 
 
                     they are statements of feelings shared by certain individuals 
 
                     at certain points in time. This Draft attempts to describe 
 
                     how members of ACM and IEEE/CS feel about professional standards 
 
                     in the year 1997. The reason for making it a public document 
 
                     is to give laypersons some idea of what those feelings are, 
 
                     and thus of what they can expect when dealing with a professional 
 
                     in the field of software engineering. If a code of ethics 
 
                     is to have any meaning at all, it must offer remedies to people 
 
                     who believe it has been violated, and the only appropriate 
 
                     way to claim such remedies is to appeal to the authority which 
 
                     promulgated the code. In this case, such an appeal would be 
 
                     made to ACM, IEEE/CS, or another professional society subscribing 
 
                     to the code. The disciplinary tools at the disposal of such 
 
                     societies range from warnings and reprimands to suspension 
 
                     or expulsion. </p>
 
                   <p>Organizations use these tools, and subscribe to codes of 
 
                     ethics, because they seek to assure the public that their 
 
                     members will act in certain ways, and that those who do not 
 
                     will lose their standing as members. Such assurances are the 
 
                     alternative to governmental regulation. At the very minimum, 
 
                     therefore, the code must require of subscribing organizations 
 
                     that they maintain a compliance body charged with receiving 
 
                     and evaluating complaints against their members. To ensure 
 
                     fairness, basic procedural safeguards should also be outlined. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p>For the sake of discussion, let me offer the proposal of 
 
                     inserting a new Principle, &quot;Governing Bodies,&quot; between 
 
                     existing Principles 7 and 8. The inclusion of such a Principle 
 
                     would make it clear that we, as software professionals, consider 
 
                     ourselves uniquely qualified to govern our own, and that we 
 
                     are asserting our intention to do so. The new Principle would 
 
                     deal with the relationship of subscribing organizations to 
 
                     the code, and of members to their governing organizations. 
 
                     It would set forth the basic obligations on both sides, including 
 
                     the obligation of professional organizations to evaluate complaints 
 
                     against their members and the right of members to be judged 
 
                     by impartial peers.</p>
 
                   <p> I realize that addressing these matters will necessitate 
 
                     a substantial amount of rework, and I deeply regret it. However, 
 
                     by the terms of its own charter, the Committee really cannot 
 
                     avoid dealing with the issue of enforcement. The original 
 
                     joint steering committee was charged with establishing &quot;appropriate 
 
                     set(s) of standards for professional practice of software 
 
                     engineering upon which industrial decisions, professional 
 
                     certification, and educational curricula can be based.&quot; 
 
                     Certification presupposes some means of enforcement. Speaking 
 
                     to you as colleagues and fellow professionals, I assure you 
 
                     that failure to make provision for enforcement will result 
 
                     in a code which is essentially irrelevant and universally 
 
                     perceived as such. Consequently, it will do nothing to avert, 
 
                     and may even invite, external regulation of a sort none of 
 
                     us wants. </p>
 
                   <p>It will not do to say that enforcement provisions can be 
 
                     left to the subscribing organizations. If our goal is to formulate 
 
                     standards of professional conduct applicable to the entire 
 
                     range of software practice ?? and that should be our goal 
 
                     ?? we must insist on a uniform interpretation of those standards. 
 
                     If we do not, the code will be interpreted by the various 
 
                     organizations in ways which diverge over time, eventually 
 
                     resulting in a muddle of conflicting precedents. For this 
 
                     reason, my own preference would be to remove complaint proceedings 
 
                     from the jurisdiction of the subscribing organizations by 
 
                     requiring a multi?organizational composition for all panels 
 
                     of inquiry. Of course, the code of ethics itself need not 
 
                     delve into such procedural details, but it must set forth 
 
                     the general guidelines for its own enforcement. [55a] </p>
 
                   <p>Sexist The authors of the Draft have attempted to avoid the 
 
                     generic masculine by resorting to the plural. Now, I dislike 
 
                     the generic masculine as much as anyone, not so much because 
 
                     it's politically incorrect as because it's inaccurate. However, 
 
                     I've found that the best substitute is the second person singular, 
 
                     which has the advantages of being simple, accurate, and direct. 
 
                     &quot;Software engineers shall ensure that they are qualified...&quot;

                     much more attention. I recommend recasting the entire document

                     projects where the working conditions under which the project 
 
                     was produced are, in the engineer's opinion, likely to lead 
 
                     to unacceptably high risks to the public or the client's safe 
 
                     and effective use of the software.[40a]</p>

                     Perhaps a simple scenario would be helpful as a footnote or 
 
                     in the preamble. The employer pays for and directs your work. 
 
                     The client commissions the work. The user uses the work. The 
 
                     public are those not directly involved. Suppose a bank hires 
 
                     the software firm you work for to develop a program for tellers. 
 
                     The bank is the client. The software firm is the employer. 
 
                     A teller is a user (or is the person seeing the teller a user, 
 
                     too?). The public includes the person do banking with the 
 
                     teller, accountants, competitors, and the rest of humanity. 
 
                     Defining and using terms consistently is an important part 
 
                     of a code. Otherwise, how can we talk about the same thing?

                     I would feel more comfortable with &quot;adequate.&quot;[42a]</p>
 
                   <p>1.06. Ensure good management for any project on which they 
 
                     work, including effective procedures for promotion of quality 
 
                     and reduction of risk 1.06 I am in favor of supporting good 
 
                     management, but uncertain also supporting this wording. Beginning 
 
                     software engineers work under existing management; it seems 
 
                     presumptuous to assume that they can realistically expect, 
 
                     cause, or require good management in every project they work 
 
                     on. I would support this if re-worded to say any project they 
 
                     manage or participate in the management. [2i]</p>
 
                   <p>One area many &#8220;new&#8221; software engineers tend to 
 
                     ignore, or not think about is proper Configuration Management 
 
                     (this includes software and documentation). It is essential 
 
                     part of any good, properly run software project and becomes 
 
                     critical once the project has been released. You might want 
 
                     to add that to this paragraph: 
 
                     Ensure good management for any project on which they work, 
 
                     including effective procedures for promotion of quality, configuration 
 
                     management, and reduction of risk. [23i]</p>
 
                   <p>Controlling management seems beyond the authority of the 
 
                     managed. 
 
                     If this were moved into the Management section, and applied 
 
                     to 
 
                     the manager, it makes sense. Otherwise, I strongly disagree.[27a]</p>
 
                   <p>Is this directed primarily to managers, or should everyone 
 
                     be expected to campaign against poor management they may be 
 
                     subject to? Unless the professional has input into management, 
 
                     I think going beyond reporting possible risks is too much 
 
                     to expect. Besides, there is a whole principle for management 
 
                     [42a]</p>
 
                   <p>1.06 and 1.07  
 
                     I oppose these clauses due to their unenforcability. Management 
 
                     and estimates are often outside the control of the software 
 
                     professional. I have done estimate numerous times only to 
 
                     see them chopped by management unconcerned with the issues. 
 
                     [43a]</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     1.07. Ensure realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, personnel, 
 
                     and outcome on any project on which they work or propose to 
 
                     work and provide a risk assessment of these estimates 
 
                     1.07</p>
 
                   <p>Altho your 1.07 is similar, the wording of item 3 of the 
 
                     Swedish code is very nice and perhaps might suggest some adjustment 
 
                     in your statements/ I treads: &#8220;only take part in projects 
 
                     with the time and resources assigned to make it possible to

                   <p>Again, this seems like management's job. If the word &quot;Ensure&quot; 
 
                     were changed to &quot;Provide&quot;, then I'm happy with it. 
 
                     Otherwise, 
 
                     I strongly disagree.[27a]</p>
 
                   <p> 1.08. Ensure adequate documentation on any project on which

                     state at least one form of documentations her (problem/solution 
 
                     logs). [43a]</p>
 
                   <p>If a problem has been solved, why should it be explicitly

                   <p>

                     1.09</p>
 
                   <p>Ensure adequate testing and debugging is partly the responsibility 
 
                     of the product provider but more so, the responsibility of

                   <p></p>
 
                   <p> 1.10. Work to develop software and related documents that 
 
                     respect the privacy of those who will be subjected to that 
 
                     software.</p>
 
                   <p> Are these the clients mentioned earlier? Or the users? Or 
 
                     the public? (&quot;subjected&quot; is a very emotionally charged 
 
                     word.) I don't see how software documentation can possibly 
 
                     violate someone's privacy (unless they are used as an example 
 
                     in a training manual.) How about Ensure that the software 
 
                     respects the privacy all concerned [42a]</p>
 
                   <p> 1.11. Be careful to use only accurate data derived from 
 
                     legal sources, and use only in ways properly authorized.</p>
 
                   <p>I'd like to see &quot;ethical&quot; in addition to &quot;legal.&quot; 
 
                     Some things may not be against the law, but not be ethical. 
 
                     In fact, much data collection today is legal, but invades 
 
                     the privacy of the public. Should this be broadened to cover 
 
                     operating legally? For instance, a patented algorithm may 
 
                     be used illegally and it only very loosely can be considered 
 
                     not in the spirit of 1.11 since it refers to data. [42a]</p>
 
                   <p> The wording in 1.11 is awkward. I suggest:</p>
 
                   <p> Take care to use only accurate data derived by lawful 
 
                     means, and to use it only in ways authorized by the 
 
                     owner of the data. 
 
                     (It's a fine point, but &quot;lawful means&quot; is preferable 
 
                     to &quot;legal sources&quot; in this context.)[55a]</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     1.12. Whenever appropriate, delete outdated or flawed data 
 
                     1.12</p>
 
                   <p>I don&#8217;t agree with the presence of this statement in 
 
                     a Software Engineering Code of Ethics. First, with respect 
 
                     to the data, flawed or outdated data can still be meaningful 
 
                     in other contexts. Second, although it is tempered with the 
 
                     &#8220; where appropriate&#8221; clause, the action of the 
 
                     statement has a direct impact on the data and the places the 
 
                     Software Engineer in a precarious position. Data are the persistent 
 
                     artifacts of the applications. Generally, the user of the 
 
                     software or other individual should be the stewart of the 
 
                     data content, not the Software Engineer. </p>
 
                   <p>Finally, if a statement regarding data quality is to appear 
 
                     in the Code of Ethics, it should place the Software Engineer 
 
                     in an advisory role to the stewart of the data, not in the 
 
                     role to act upon the data. A more acceptable statement would 
 
                     be something like: &#8220;Promote understanding and awareness 
 
                     of the quality of the data management issues that surround 
 
                     the data that affect the product.&#8221; [10i] </p>
 
                   <p>Not (?)thin scope of control. [21a]</p>
 
                   <p>&#8220;Delete&#8221;? How about &#8220;remove to archive 
 
                     or delete&#8221; [13a]</p>
 
                   <p>If the word &quot;delete&quot; is changed to &quot;delete, 
 
                     mark or report as invalid,&quot; 
 
                     then this makes sense. Otherwise, it calls on the employee 
 
                     to delete 
 
                     data that belongs to the employer, and over which he may not 
 
                     have 
 
                     authority. Maybe this is covered by &quot;whenever appropriate.&quot;[27a]</p>
 
                   <p>It may be adequate even preferable to flag outdated or flawed 
 
                     dada so that we don&#8217;t lore history. Suggest &#8220;... 
 
                     delete or clearly label outdated or ...&#8221;[28a]</p>
 
                   <p>Modify and evaluate. Maybe store if required later. [29a]</p>
 
                   <p>Agree if there is a very strict process in place to determine 
 
                     which is outdated and flawed. [36i].</p>
 
                   <p>1.12 ? Your outdated data might be my regression test data 
 
                     to keep a 10 year old program running. Deleting bad data is 
 
                     good. [43a]</p>
 
                   <p>Possibly 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12 should be combined to say data 
 
                     should be obtained, maintained, and used legally, ethically, 
 
                     and accurately. [42a] 
 
                      
 
                     And brush three times a day? Too specific.[49a]</p>
 
                   <p> Descending to the level of the technical, I'm extremely 
 
                     uncomfortable with Clause 1.12. Perhaps elaboration would 
 
                     make its intent clearer, but as it stands it encourages dangerous 
 
                     practices. To begin with, of course, it's seldom unequivocally 
 
                     clear to a practitioner that a particular element of data 
 
                     is &quot;outdated,&quot; or even &quot;flawed.&quot; Only 
 
                     the owner of the data can make that determination, and then 
 
                     only with competent technical advice from a professional. 
 
                     Even if the owner of the data deems it outdated or flawed, 
 
                     it's seldom good practice to delete data altogether, because 
 
                     such decisions are irrevocable and not in? frequently regretted. 
 
                     The more prudent course is to &quot;comment out&quot; obsolete 
 
                     data if possible, or move it offline to backup media. </p>
 
                   <p>I think perhaps the Committee meant to address a very real 
 
                     concern about privacy. The proliferation of databases contain? 
 
                     ing extensive personal information concerns all of us, and 
 
                     the code should explicitly encourage extreme caution in the 
 
                     collection and use of such data, even, perhaps, to the extent 
 
                     of pro? hibiting the participation of professionals in the 
 
                     collection of personal data which is not properly safeguarded. 
 
                     But that is a different issue. The code must simultaneously 
 
                     foster two things: Utmost respect for the privacy of those 
 
                     about whom per? sonal data is collected, and a high degree 
 
                     of respect for the rights of the owners of data. Each of these 
 
                     is sufficiently im? portant to warrant a Clause of its own.[55a]

                     1.14 
 
                     I oppose the last sentence: &#8220;Make any tradeoffs clear 
 
                     to all parties concerned.&#8221; This is over-specification, 
 
                     and to detailed . Almost every design and implementation decision 
 
                     has quality and cost implications and involves tradeoffs between 
 
                     cost and quality. Yet one certainly does not want to make 
 
                     all these tradeoffs clear to all the parties involved -- nor 
 
                     would they want it. Eliminate this, or quantify with &#8220;important&#8221;,

                     clear to the public that quality is being traded off for profit 
 
                     and features? The public generally believes that better quality

                   <p>Principle 2: PUBLIC Software engineers shall, in their professional 
 
                     role, act only in ways consistent with the public safety, 
 
                     health and welfare. In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
 
                   <p>2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any 
 
                     actual or potential danger to the user, a third party, or 
 
                     the environment, that they reasonably believe to be associated 
 
                     with software or related documents for which they are responsible, 
 
                     or merely know about.  
 
                     2.01</p>
 
                   <p>The wording &#8220; merely know about&#8221; implies a very 
 
                     weak position and should be removed. [9i]</p>
 
                   <p>Maybe it is just the phrasing of the statement , but I would 
 
                     strike the final phrase (&#8220;merely know about&#8221;) 
 
                     from this statement. I also would strike &#8220;actual or 
 
                     potential&#8221;. With these corrections, I would have responded 
 
                     &#8220;Favor&#8221; to this item on the survey.[10i]</p>

                   <p>Where did this &quot;third party&quot; come from? Isn't that

                   <p></p>
 
                   <p>2.02. Approve software only if they have a well?founded belief 
 
                     that it is safe, meets specifications, has passed appropriate 
 
                     tests, and does not diminish quality of life or harm the environment. 
 
                     2.02</p>
 
                   <p>Item 2.02 of the ACM/IEEE proposed code of ethics states 
 
                     &#8220;Approve software only if ... [it] does not .... harm 
 
                     the environment.&#8221; As I read it, this seems to declare 
 
                     unethical virtually any piece of software related to civil 
 
                     engineering. Fir example, suppose some one wanted to build 
 
                     a road. The construction of the road could damage the environment 
 
                     by being built in a wetland or other environmentally sensitive 
 
                     area. Any software used in building the road would thus contribute 
 
                     to damage the environment. Software used to help design dams 
 
                     is another case where the clear result of civil engineering 
 
                     software is damage to the environment. I doubt it is the intention 
 
                     of the code of ethics to declare unethical the development 
 
                     of most civil engineering software but I think it does just 
 
                     that. [26a]</p>
 
                   <p>Get real. Complex products are released before all tests 
 
                     pass when prudent risk says probability of catastrophe is 
 
                     acceptably low ~ typically with hundreds of unresolved problem 
 
                     reports.[28a]</p>
 
                   <p> 2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared under 
 
                     their supervision or within their areas of competence and 
 
                     with which they are in agreement.

                   <p>2.03 duplicates 3.02 [35a]</p>
 
                   <p> &quot;Affix their signature&quot; is somewhat limiting. 
 
                     Does this mean the more general &quot;sign off on&quot;? Is 
 
                     it okay to verbally consent to something, say, under coercion? 
 
                     How about &quot;Sign or affirm&quot;? 4.02 uses the more general 
 
                     &quot;approve.&quot; [42a]</p>
 
                   <p> 2.04. Co?operate in efforts to address matters of grave 
 
                     public concern caused by software or related documents 
 
                     2.04</p>
 
                   <p>Just what is a &#8220;grave public concern&#8221; Too vague. 
 
                     Don&#8217;t know what, why to whom. [9i]</p>
 
                   <p>Not definable. [21a]</p>
 
                   <p>Here are those document again. I really don't understand 
 
                     how software?related documents could be a cause for concern. 
 
                     Are you talking about poor or incorrect documentation leading 
 
                     to problems? [42a]</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     2.05. Endeavor to produce software that respects diversity. 
 
                     Issues of language, different abilities, physical access, 
 
                     mental access, economic advantage, and allocation of resources 
 
                     should all be considered 
 
                     2.05 
 
                     I favor respecting diversity, however there is a segment of 
 
                     society that want to go overboard. I don&#8217;t object to 
 
                     current wording but don&#8217;t go any further. [1i]</p>
 
                   <p>It is my opinion that diversity is a method of (?)Bathhazing(?) 
 
                     the country, of dividing us into groups for the purpose of 
 
                     creating and consolidating political power, especially on 
 
                     the left. It is a classic use of the principle of divide and 
 
                     conquer. The specific text of clause 2.05 contains a puzzling 
 
                     term &#8220; mental access,&#8221; as opposed to (?) Or (?) 
 
                     physical access.&#8221; What does that mean? Does that mean 
 
                     the ability to access computers by people whose mental abilities 
 
                     are less than normal? The only way to know of (?)doing(?) 
 
                     Is to (?)&#8221;dumbdown&#8221; (?) The user interface. I 
 
                     will not for example attempt to create a word processor that 
 
                     the illiterate could use. [8i]</p>
 
                   <p>Will this increase cost/time against or beyond specifications? 
 
                     [9i]</p>
 
                   <p>I wish this could be worded to include &#8220;sensory access&#8221; 
 
                     or &#8220;sensory abilities&#8221;. I have to read very broadly 
 
                     to understand that 2.05 includes the needs of the visually 
 
                     impaired and the hearing impaired. With the current technologies 
 
                     we should be able to design for all sensory anomalies. [14i]</p>
 
                   <p>I think this should be qualified by stating &#8220; where 
 
                     reasonable&#8221;. I agree that coders should endeavor to 
 
                     do this but many situations exist where this is not needed. 
 
                     How far do they go? [20a]</p>
 
                   <p>PC has nothing to do with ethics.[15a]</p>
 
                   <p>Targeting the audience of software users should be more of 
 
                     a concern/goal than trying to attack world?hunger with each 
 
                     software produced...it's a bit too forward looking [31a]</p>
 
                   <p>The wording of principle 2 and clause 2,05, as compared to 
 
                     principle 1, make it appear to me that supporting diversity 
 
                     is more important than producing a product which meets design 
 
                     specifications. Diversity requirements should be addressed 
 
                     in the specifications and the software engineer should not 
 
                     arbitrarily increase the scope of the work. I would prefer 
 
                     the language to be similar to &#8220;Endeavor to produce software 
 
                     that is usable by all members of the target group.&#8221; 
 
                     All software is designed for some subset of the human race. 
 
                     To attempt to design software usable by everyone is simply 
 
                     not practical. [35i]</p>
 
                   <p>2.05 - Completely unnecessary. If I want to sell worldwide 
 
                     I should take internationalization into account. If I want 
 
                     to write software for middle?age white males I should be allowed 
 
                     to do so with out breaking a code of ethics [43a]</p>
 
                   <p>The only portion of your proposal with which I have any real 
 
                     trouble is subsection 2.05. I understand the temptation to 
 
                     include politically correct verbiage, but I object to the 
 
                     clause, especially the phrase &quot;respect diversity&quot;. 
 
                     I'm sure Hillary Clinton would applaud this portion, but I 
 
                     find it unacceptable, for the following reasons: </p>
 
                   <p>1. It's vague. As an example, some computer programs help 
 
                     insurance companies set prices for policies, sometimes based 
 
                     on where people live. This results in people living in high?crime 
 
                     areas paying higher rates or being denied policies. Statistically, 
 
                     these people are disproportionately minorities. If I work 
 
                     with a client on a project to develop such software, have 
 
                     I violated this subsection? Surely some people who have spoken 
 
                     out against this so?called &quot;red?lining&quot; would say 
 
                     I have. However, if insurance companies have the legal right??perhaps 
 
                     even a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders??to 
 
                     sell policies based on established risk factors, isn't it 
 
                     in society's interest that the best possible software engineers 
 
                     work on such systems? </p>
 
                   <p>2. It's contradictory. I am currently working with a client 
 
                     whose product provides dating-related services over the phone, 
 
                     both for purposes of long?term relationships and simple sexual 
 
                     gratification, some of it homosexual. Being a libertarian, 
 
                     this does not concern me. However, if I were an employee at 
 
                     a contract software firm, and my religious faith condemned 
 
                     premarital and homosexual sex, would I fail to &quot;respect 
 
                     diversity&quot; by refusing to work on such a project, or 
 
                     would my employer fail to &quot;respect diversity&quot; by 
 
                     insisting that I do such work or be fired? </p>
 
                   <p>3. It's pointless. Any software engineer who works on games 
 
                     such as those &quot;Nazi death camp&quot; ones so widely reported 
 
                     not too long ago could hardly be expected to trouble his head 
 
                     much with a code of ethics, yes? In other words, the hardcore 
 
                     &quot;diversity disrespectors&quot; won't care about this 
 
                     clause. Those of us who will care, already do care. </p>
 
                   <p>4. It's dangerous. Recent history abounds with instances 
 
                     of companies and individuals who were branded by the spokesfolks 
 
                     of the politically correct as people who failed to &quot;respect 
 
                     diversity&quot;??the usual words were &quot;bigots&quot;, 
 
                     &quot;racists&quot;, &quot;homophobes&quot;, etc. In some 
 
                     cases, facts emerged to debunk the charges, but by then the 
 
                     demogogues coordinating the public tarring and feathering 
 
                     of the allegedly insensitive entity had built up such a head 
 
                     of steam that not even the truth could stop the stampede. 
 
                     Just by being a white male, my odds of being the guest of 
 
                     dishonor in such an incident are unfairly high. I can ill?afford 
 
                     a code of ethics that exposes me to further ignominy at the 
 
                     hands of some self?appointed protector of some self?designated 
 
                     oppressed element of society. Careers have been ruined this 
 
                     way, in some cases most unfairly.</p>
 
                   <p> 5. It's unnecessary. I believe other portions of the code 
 
                     adequately address participating in or abetting an illegal 
 
                     act of discrimination or a hate crime. Issues like discrimination, 
 
                     racism, lifestyle-choice rights, and immigration are highly?charged 
 
                     social questions that are both morally complex and rapidly 
 
                     evolving. In my opinion, guidance on these matters is beyond 
 
                     the scope of a professional code of ethics, and surely beyond 
 
                     the scope of two short sentences. In Stalinist Russia, few 
 
                     examples so capture the fallacy and stupidity of socialism 
 
                     as &quot;Socialist Science&quot;. Scientists bent their knees 
 
                     to the Communist Party and its tyrants, pursuing all sorts 
 
                     of ridiculous theories because they met with the approval 
 
                     of the Soviet hierarchy, turning their backs on the truth. 
 
                     I don't want to suggest that this subsection is on the scale 
 
                     of that grotesquely, but I do want to point out a parallel: 
 
                     All science must be ethically and morally informed, but it 
 
                     must not take sides in political matters. Of course, I grant 
 
                     anyone the right to view respecting diversity, however one 
 
                     defines it, as a pillar of one's personal ethics; however, 
 
                     I ask that this code not make it a mandatory part of the ethical 
 
                     values of every software engineer. [39a]</p>
 
                   <p> Today &quot;diversity&quot; is used to cover approval of 
 
                     actions with which I strongly disagree. How about the more 
 
                     neutral &quot;differences&quot;? [42a]</p>
 
                   <p> irrlelevant to most computing fields[49a]</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     2.06. Be fair and truthful in all statements, particularly 
 
                     public ones, concerning software or related documents 
 
                     2.06</p>
 
                   <p>In item 2.06 you sat, &#8220;Be fair and truthful in all 
 
                     statements....&#8221;. Consider using a term such as &#8220;avoid 
 
                     deception&#8221;, which not only prohibits falsehoods, but 
 
                     also covers the case of deceiving via not disclosing relevant 
 
                     information, in other words, deception by omission. [4i]</p>
 
                   <p> 2.07. Not put self?interest, the interest of an employer, 
 
                     the interest of a client, or the interest of the user ahead 
 
                     of the public's interest. 
 
                     2.07</p>
 
                   <p>Are we the government? [9i]</p>
 
                   <p>I think that this statement is problematic. I think it is 
 
                     important that self-interest not subvert the interests of 
 
                     the employer, client, or public; however, the statement is 
 
                     too ambitious when it promotes public interest ahead of that 
 
                     of the employer. If the Software Engineer has adequately &#8220;prequalified&#8221; 
 
                     the employer or client and determined that the employer or 
 
                     client is not actively working against the public interest, 
 
                     then I suggest that it is the responsibility of the Software 
 
                     Engineer to advise the employer or client regarding any concerns 
 
                     relatively to the interest of the public at large. In this 
 
                     manner, the Software Engineer can play the role of educating 
 
                     those with the ability to affect public interest. [10i]</p>

                     interest&#8221; is very nebulous, since the public is made

                   <p>Tricky. What is &#8220; public interest&#8221; exactly?[34a]</p>
 
                   <p>2.07 - Unless working for the government, the public does 
 
                     not directly pay my salary. My self?interest and the interests 
 
                     of my employer are first as long as there are no illegal activities. 
 
                     From this statement everything should be &quot;freeware&quot; 
 
                     since this would be in the public's interest. [43a]</p>
 
                   <p> The public would be interested in getting my services for 
 
                     free. How about &quot;Balance self?interest, the interest

                     software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
 
                   <p> 3.01. Maintain professional objectivity with respect to

                   <p>Item 3,02 is essentially the same as 2.03.[11i] 
 
                     This is a near?duplicate of 2.03, and this doesn't have &quot;with 
 
                     which they are in agreement.&quot; How about moving 2.03 here?[42a]</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     3.03. Reject bribery 
 
                     3.03 and 3.04</p>
 
                   <p>It ought to be possible to merge items 3.03 and 3.04 in a 
 
                     single statement that would cover offering, soliciting, and 
 
                     accepting bribes. [4i]</p>
 
                   <p> Bribery (under euphemistic terms) is a part of the culture 
 
                     in many South American countries. This may be hard to get 
 
                     agreement on. How about &quot;Do not accept, use, or condone 
 
                     the use of bribes.&quot; [42a]</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     3.04. Accept no payback, kickback, or other payment from a 
 
                     third party to a contract, except with the knowledge and consent 
 
                     of all parties to the contract. 
 
                     3.04 </p>
 
                   <p>You phases on the short sheet are more clear than &#8220;no 
 
                     payback....&#8221;. &#8220;Do not accept secret payments.&#8221; 
 
                     [9i]</p>
 
                   <p> The phrase &quot;third party to a contract&quot; seems odd. 
 
                     I think it should be &quot;party outside the contract&quot; 
 
                     since I'm sure contracts can have fourth and fifth parties, 
 
                     too.[42a]</p>
 
                   <p></p>
 
                   <p> 3.05. Accept payment from only one party for any particular 
 
                     project, or for services specific to that project, except 
 
                     when the circumstances have been fully disclosed to parties 
 
                     concerned and they have given their informed consent. 
 
                     3.05</p>
 
                   <p>&#8220;Do not accept&#8221; could be changed to indicate 
 
                     a positive statement of clearly defining where and how all 
 
                     payments are expected. A work of software for sale implies 
 
                     many future payments. [9i]</p>
 
                   <p>Too vague.[21a]</p>
 
                   <p> Why is this phrased differently? &quot;when the circumstances 
 
                     have been fully disclosed to parties concerned and they have 
 
                     given their informed consent&quot; vs. &quot;with the knowledge 
 
                     and consent of all parties to the contract&quot; in 3.04. 
 
                     I like the phrasing of 3.04 better. [42a]</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     3.06. Disclose to all concerned parties those conflicts of 
 
                     interest that cannot reasonably be avoided or escaped and 
 
                     aspire to resolve them. </p>
 
                   <p>3.07. Refuse to participate in any decision of a governmental 
 
                     or professional body, as a member or advisor, concerned with 
 
                     software, or related documents, in which they, their employer, 
 
                     or their client have a financial interest. 
 
                     3.07 
 
                     I favor avoiding undisclosed potential conflicts. At the same 
 
                     time, expect professional behavior. [1i]</p>
 
                   <p>I am concerned with the way this is worded, which seems to 
 
                     preclude opposing my employer on anything without company 
 
                     approval. If my company wants to expand a plant and I as a 
 
                     taxpayer of the city involved oppose this because it would 
 
                     be a zoning violation, increase traffic, etc. I should fill 
 
                     free to do so. Even if the issue is &#8220;technical&#8221; 
 
                     or &#8220;software engineering&#8221; issue, as a private 
 
                     citizen I should not have to be silent unless my company is 
 
                     trying to sell a software package to the local school district 
 
                     and I think another package would be better. As a taxpayer, 
 
                     I want to provide such input - and not at the whim of my employer. 
 
                     I can always make clear that I speak for myself, not my employer. 
 
                     [2i]</p>
 
                   <p>I have some trouble with the wording of 3.07, Avoiding conflicting 
 
                     financail interests. As wprded it seems overly broad in one 
 
                     sense ant to narrow in another. I realize that it is just 
 
                     as important to avoid an impression of conflict of interest. 
 
                     However, being engineers we are sometimes called upon by all 
 
                     concerned to render an opinion or vote on a subject. Need 
 
                     we avoid giving opinions when we feel we can be fair and impartial 
 
                     to all concerned? I marked 3.07 as uncertain. Perhaps 3.07 
 
                     could reference 3.06 to help expose conflicts to all concerned. 
 
                     If approved, an opinion could still be rendered. Perhaps 3.07 
 
                     could be more like the simple four word definition.[3i]</p>
 
                   <p>I may participate. However, I must disclose the conflicts 
 
                     before participation and clearly state. [9i]</p>
 
                   <p>The verb &quot;refuse&quot; is too strong. Also, restricting 
 
                     the statement to &quot;financial interest&quot; likely misses 
 
                     other important &quot;interests.&quot; A Software Engineer 
 
                     with an interest should fully disclose the nature of the interest. 
 
                     Based on the Software Engineer's belief that an unbiased opinion 
 
                     can be rendered and the comfort of the decision-making body 
 
                     a decision regarding the nature of the participation of the 
 
                     Software Engineer in the decision process can be made and 
 
                     acted on accordingly. [10i]</p>
 
                   <p>I disagree with 3.07. What if I&#8217;m the only person, 
 
                     or one of the best, qualified to make an informed comment? 
 
                     Even if other people are qualified and willing , this assumes 
 
                     that</p>
 
                   <p> 1) I&#8217;m capable of being objective if I have a financial 
 
                     interest in the subject,</p>
 
                   <p> 2) I&#8217;ll be perfectly objective even if I have some 
 
                     other interest in the subject, as long as it&#8217;d not financial, 
 
                     and </p>
 
                   <p>3) the people who listen to me are incapable of recognizing 
 
                     my possible bias and correcting it. I think a better approach 
 
                     is to require me to disclose any and all interest I have in 
 
                     the subject- financial and otherwise - and let the other people 
 
                     take it into account. That is , assume the people who asked 
 
                     for my opinion are intelligent enough to know how to interpet 
 
                     it. If they&#8217;re complete idiots, Im probably wouldn&#8217;t 
 
                     waste my time talking to them, anyway. [11i] </p>
 
                   <p>Does this imply you cannot serve on a standards committee 
 
                     developing or enhancing standards for a product that your

                     work that is not in the public domain, where such confidentiality 
 
                     is not inconsistent with matters of public concern. 
 
                     This is worded to suggest that I cannot even chat with my 
 
                     wife or colleagues about what I am doing, even in general 
 
                     terms. I agree that trade secrets, competitive advantage software, 
 
                     etc. must be guarded, but why would it be ethical to talk 
 
                     about a mundane implementation of a payroll program or user 
 
                     interface for library? This overlaps significantly with 5.02.

                     4.07</p>
 
                   <p>I believe that inform is too weak for this statement. In 
 
                     addition to informing, the Software Engineer should provide 
 
                     additional substantiation for his or her opinion. It is also 
 
                     important that the Software Engineer maintain a documentation 
 
                     regarding the informing of the client or employer. [10i]</p>

                     employer or another appropriate authority should be informed 
 
                     of the engineer&#8217;s ethical concern.

                   <p>Very difficult to read. Is the S.E. being placed in the position 
 
                     of relating adherence to the code which the employer does 
 
                     not abide by? [9i]</p>
 
                   <p>should say strongly that this applies in cases of specific 
 
                     conflicts of interest; employers often have a very expansive 
 
                     view of what is &quot;in conflict of interest&quot; ? including 
 
                     things that are neutral to the employer [40a]</p>
 
                   <p> Passive voice is awkward in 4.09. I suggest:</p>
 
                   <p> Represent no interest adverse to their employer's without 
 
                     the employer's specific consent, unless a higher ethical concern 
 
                     is being compromised; and in that case, inform the employer

                   <p>While it may be implied by the current wording of 5.03, it 
 
                     might be well to make more explicit a requirement that the

                     when giving them work assignments. [4i]

                   <p>Principle 6: PROFESSION.</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, in all professional matters, advance 
 
                     both the integrity and reputation of their profession as is 
 
                     consistent with public health, safety, and welfare. In particular, 
 
                     software engineers shall, insofar as possible:</p>
 
                   <p> 6.01. Associate only with reputable businesses and organizations. 
 
                     6.01 
 
                     Sounds good in theory, but I&#8217;m not so certain about 
 
                     practice. &#8220;Reputable&#8221; is very subjective, and 
 
                     very much defined by &#8220; the establishment&#8221;. A software 
 
                     engineer working for protesters against the war in Viet Nam 
 
                     could easily have been charged with working with a disreputable 
 
                     group. [2i] </p>
 
                   <p>Does this mean I don't play Dungeons and Dragons with a local 
 
                     gaming 
 
                     club because it is considered by some to be a tool of the 
 
                     Devil? 
 
                     If this is restated to make it clear that it means &quot;don't 
 
                     work for 
 
                     the mob, or dictators,&quot; then I can agree with it.[27a]</p>
 
                   <p>&#8220;Reputable&#8221; is so subject to interpretation as 
 
                     to be meaningless. While a professional should not covertly 
 
                     partner with a disreputable business or organization, various 
 
                     forms of association are unavoidable in normal human commerce.</p>
 
                   <p> &#8220;Reputable is totally subjecrtive. Is the DOD reputable? 
 
                     Penthouse Magazine?[49a]</p>
 
                   <p> I find Clause 6.01 troublesome. Does this mean that a competent 
 
                     practitioner who happens to be a Stalinist or a member of 
 
                     the Ku Klux Klan forfeits professional standing? Perhaps we 
 
                     really do want to make that determination, but if so it must 
 
                     be very explicit, and the proscribed affiliations must be 
 
                     clearly spelled out. As a practical matter, it makes more 
 
                     sense to condemn actions than to condemn affiliations, e.g., 
 
                     a theoretical Stalinist may practice, whereas a Pol Pot would 
 
                     be considered worthy of expulsion. A more mundane reading 
 
                     of 6.01 ?? and one the Committee probably intended ?? would 
 
                     restrict its applicability to dealings in the course of doing 
 
                     business, so that, for example, a professional would decline 
 
                     to deal with a firm known to produce defective software. But 
 
                     this distinction must be made explicit. As it stands, 6.01 
 
                     is too vague to offer any useful guidance.[55a]</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     6.02. Ensure that clients, employers, and supervisors know 
 
                     of the software engineer's commitment to this code of ethics, 
 
                     and their own responsibility under it. 
 
                     6.02</p>
 
                   <p>Prejudicial.[21a]</p>
 
                   <p> This seems to say that the software engineer's commitment 
 
                     to the code also commits the client, employer, and supervisor 
 
                     (the antecedent of &quot;their&quot;). How about &quot;and 
 
                     the software engineer's expectations of them under it&quot;?[42a]</p>
 
                   <p></p>
 
                   <p> 6.03. Support those who similarly do as this code requires.</p>
 
                   <p> Uncertain about wording: &quot;those who *do* as this code 
 
                     requires.&quot; The group is identified by action, not by 
 
                     profession. How about &quot;Support other software engineers 
 
                     in striving to follow this code.&quot; [42a]</p>
 
                   <p></p>
 
                   <p> 6.04. Help develop an organizational environment favorable

                   <p> 6.05. Report anything reasonably believed to be a violation 
 
                     of this code to appropriate authorities 
 
                     6.05 
 
                     Who decides who is the appropriate &#8220;authority&#8221;?[1i]</p>
 
                   <p>To whom? To what avail? This code is very short on enforcement. 
 
                     The legal &amp; medical &#8220;professions&#8221; are two 
 
                     shiny examples of how poorly this works. [2i]</p>
 
                   <p>&#8220;Report anything believed to be a violation of this 
 
                     code to appropriate authorities.&#8221; While I am not prepared 
 
                     to generate a big argument about this, it somehow bothers 
 
                     me. A minor point is that, for many parts of the code, there 
 
                     might not be any &#8220;appropriate authorities&#8221; to 
 
                     report to. Perhaps more basic is a vague distaste with requiring 
 
                     people to&#8221; turn in&#8221; delinquent colleagues. This 
 
                     is NOT to deny that there are many cases where this is appropriate 
 
                     and necessary, but I wonder if it should be made I to a universal 
 
                     rule. Rule 2.01 covers an important subset of such cases. 
 
                     This might be expanded by including, for example situations 
 
                     where other forms of harm to people, such as theft, fraud, 
 
                     or plagiarism is involved. [4i]</p>
 
                   <p>To whom? [9i]</p>
 
                   <p>6.05 - This should be handled internally to start with. This 
 
                     sounds like you should rat on your cube?mate if they do something 
 
                     wrong.[43a]</p>
 
                   <p>A noble goal, but a bit too idealistic (is anonymous reporting 
 
                     okay?) [38a]</p>

                     There would have to be some ACM/IEEE board of software engineering

                     How does an engineer that works as an employee stay abreast 
 
                     of this information? Many companies have policies regarding 
 
                     the sharing of salary information. This places the engineer 
 
                     on unequal footing with the employer who may have an interest 
 
                     in keeping pay low. [10i] </p>

                     the code by following the law, otherwise the code would be 
 
                     better then the law and the SE would somehow have the capacity 
 
                     to know this. How? [9i]</p>
 
                   <p>says &#8220;obey all laws, unless you don&#8217;t want to&#8221; 
 
                     unacceptable.[15a]</p>
 
                   <p> This says that a professional must place their own judgment 
 
                     above obedience to the law. Granted this must occur in extreme 
 
                     cases, but this clause is much too strong. Perhaps just &quot;Obey 
 
                     all laws governing their work&quot; is enough, and let general 
 
                     statements such as &quot;standards may conflict with each 
 
                     other&quot; and &quot;consistent with public health, safety, 
 
                     and welfare&quot; in Principles 2, 4, and 6 invoke the rare 
 
                     exceptions. After all, we don't tack the clause onto 5.02, 
 
                     5.06, 6.01, etc. where conflicts may arise. I believe we must 
 
                     encourage obedience to the law even if it may occasionally 
 
                     be contrary to what we perceive as public health, safety, 
 
                     and welfare. </p>
 
                   <p>A lawless society is a much greater danger than laws requiring

                     a clause about working to improve or enact laws to bring about 
 
                     a legal environment conducive to the good development and 
 
                     use of software? [42a]</p>

                     unethical, I believe that, particularly in a comprehensive 
 
                     code, this should be stated explicitly. This isdone well, 
 
                     I believe in item 8 of the IEEE code. [4i]</p>

                     is not in the public domain, only with their prior knowledge,

                     7.02 
 
                     I oppose the blanket prohibition of reviewing another&#8217;s

                     is no reason a competent, professional software engineer needs 
 
                     to know another person is reviewing their work in all cases. 
 
                     It seems perfectly reasonable to me for someone paying for 
 
                     software to be able to ask a s many independent reviewers 
 
                     or outside parties to check, audit, or otherwise review work 
 
                     along the way. A professional should expect his work to be

                     managers or professors adding their names as coauthors of 
 
                     papers to which the made no substantial contribution. [4i]</p>

                     on its face, and in many situations clearly one that we would 
 
                     like to see enforced, can easily be perverted to serve unethical 
 
                     purposes. There is a history of such provision in the codes 
 
                     of engineering societies being used to attack conscientious 
 
                     engineers pointing out serious wrongdoing by other engineers 
 
                     that threatened the public safety or welfare. You might refer 
 
                     to my book for examples. (I failed to prevent such a provision 
 
                     from being inserted in the IEEE code.) [4i] </p>
 
                   <p>7.07 - Some folks need their careers interfered with. This 
 
                     would lead me to think I could no get rid of an incompetent 
 
                     engineer because I would most certainly be hindering their 
 
                     career in software. There are also people who are good but 
 
                     miscast in the role they want to play and need nudged into 
 
                     areas fitting their talents.[43a]</p>
 
                   <p> With regard to complaints against professionals, I'm sure 
 
                     that many respondents will join me in expressing concern about 
 
                     Clause 7.07. This clause appears intended to offer protection 
 
                     against discrimination on the basis of factors unrelated to 
 
                     competence, but if that's the case, the Committee should explicitly 
 
                     say so. (In fact, I find no language condemning such discrimination 
 
                     anywhere in the Draft, and I consider that to be a serious 
 
                     omission.) The specific problem with 7.07 is that it could 
 
                     foster the kind of tacit &quot;code of silence&quot; sometimes 
 
                     associated with physicians and police officers -- a code which 
 
                     discourages members of the profession from testifying against 
 
                     each other. I'm sure you'll agree that we do not want to discourage 
 
                     the prompt identification of incompetent practitioners, or 
 
                     practitioners operating outside their field of competence. 
 
                     Nobody is in a better position to do this than colleagues 
 
                     &#8211; indeed, they do so now, as a matter of common (if 
 
                     informal) practice. At the very least, therefore, 7.07 should 
 
                     be amended to read something like this: </p>
 
                   <p> Not interfere in the professional career progression 
 
                     of any colleague, except in cases where concern for 
 
                     client or public welfare causes a professional to 
 
                     question the competence of a colleague for the work 
 
                     being performed.[55a]</p>

                     7.08, I shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about avoiding self 
 
                     interest so long as power relationship is reasonably symmetric.

                     I am concerned about the wording here -- note the survey sheet 
 
                     says &#8220;Do no pursue a job offered to a colleague&#8221; 
 
                     -- if that sort of &#8220;agree not to compete&#8221; meaning 
 
                     is intended, then I oppose this. I am against any sort of 
 
                     trade-union, monopolistic, or competition limiting practices. 
 
                     The purpose of the code should not be to limit in any way 
 
                     competition. In no way should standard or fixed fees with 
 
                     any sort of &#8220;gentleman&#8217;s agreement&#8221; or &#8220;professional

                     be interjected but I am still competing with others for jobs.

                     outside of academia!!!)[38a]</p>
 
                   <p> Suppose I am competing with another SE for a job which could 
 
                     use a lot of C++ experience. If I have a lot more experience 
 
                     than she does, I don't see the problem with pointing out my 
 
                     greater experience to improve my chances of getting the job 
 
                     (personal gain) and lessening hers (undermining her job prospects). 
 
                     How about something like &quot;Not undermine with false, distorted, 
 
                     or irrelevant information another SE's job prospects ...&quot;?

                     7.09. In situations outside of their own areas of competence, 
 
                     call upon the opinions of other professionals who have competence 
 
                     in that area.</p>

                   <p>8. Self</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 8: SELF. Software engineers shall, throughout their 
 
                     career, strive to enhance their own ability to practice their 
 
                     profession as it should be practiced. In particular, software 
 
                     engineers shall continually endeavor to:</p>
 
                   <p> 8.01. Further their knowledge of developments in the analysis, 
 
                     design, development, and testing of software and related documents, 
 
                     together with the management of the development process. 
 
                     8.01</p>
 
                   <p>I think &#8220;specification&#8221; should be added to clause 
 
                     8.01's ;1ST of areas inn which we should further our knowledge, 
 
                     ahead of &#8220;design, development and testing.&#8221; [26a]</p>
 
                   <p> 8.02. Improve their ability to create safe, reliable, and 
 
                     useful quality software at reasonable cost and within a reasonable 
 
                     time.</p>
 
                   <p>8.03. Improve their ability to write accurate, informative, 
 
                     and literate documents in support of software on which they 
 
                     work. 
 
                     8.03</p>
 
                   <p>I am not sure if we (SE&#8217;s) should document work or 
 
                     if we should engage a professional like technical writer to 
 
                     document the outcome. We might ensure adequate documention 
 
                     is available. Who does it is another issue. [9i]</p>
 
                   <p>8.04. Improve their understanding of the software and related 
 
                     documents on which they work and of the environment in which 
 
                     they will be used.</p>
 
                   <p> 8.04 To what purpose other than to enhance abilities to 
 
                     create other products. If so then is it not just repeating 
 
                     concepts? [9i]</p>
 
                   <p> 8.05. Improve their knowledge of the law governing the software 
 
                     and related documents on which they work. 
 
                     8.05</p>
 
                   <p>50 states with their own regulations, and Federal , too? 
 
                     This is a bit much to dump on computer professionals. Lawmakers 
 
                     need to help out with disseminating statutory information 
 
                     and/or standardizing the statutes so here is less to disseminate.[34a]</p>
 
                   <p> 8.06. Improve their knowledge of this code, its interpretation, 
 
                     and its application to their work.</p>
 
                   <p> 8.07. Refrain from requiring or influencing others to undertake 
 
                     any action which involves a breach of this code.</p>
 
                   <p> 8.07. Refrain from requiring or influencing others to undertake 
 
                     any action which involves a breach of this code. 
 
                     8.07</p>
 
                   <p>too busy. [21a]</p>
 
                   <p> &quot;Influencing&quot; should be strong enough; &quot;requiring&quot; 
 
                     is not necessary. Significantly overlaps 5.09.[42a]</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     8.08. Consider violations of this code inconsistent with being 
 
                     a professional software engineer and encourage colleagues 
 
                     to adhere to this code.  
 
                     8.08</p>
 
                   <p>too subjective [21a]</p>
 
                   <p>8.08 While I believe this is appropriate the contents of 
 
                     this code would keep me from promoting it in its current form.[43a]
