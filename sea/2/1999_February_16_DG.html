       <p>Dear Messrs. Cabrera and Frailey,
       <p> The SEEPP task force met on Saturday 16 February from 8-12 at the ACM 
         Computer Science Conference in Philadelphia.</p>
       <p> I began by reporting to the group the interest of the British Computer 
         Society in our work and their desire to work with us, and expressing concern 
         with our progress. I informed the task force that I am scheduled for sabbatical 
         next year and the SEEPP project is one of the projects I will be working 
         on. I have already scheduled work on it with task force members in the 
         U.K. I presented a high level schedule for the completion of our task 
         which would eliminate the episodic approach we had taken. That preliminary 
         schedule is attached. In order to help define elements in our deliverable, 
         I distributed a paper I wrote comparing the work of several professional 
         societies.</p>
       <p> The schedule was reviewed and most of the meeting was spent detailing 
         and assigning specific tasks needed to complete the standards of practices, 
         standards of conduct and standards of ethics preliminary document to be 
         presented to the IEEE-CS/ACM steering committee in January 1997. The document 
         is considered preliminary because we will need to incorporate and be responsive 
         to the input of the skills task force and the education task force.</p>
       <p> During the meeting, an optimistic biweekly schedule of deliverables 
         was developed. I will personally see monthly deliverables from each of 
         the working groups. We are all volunteers, but to be able to accomplish 
         our task effectively and efficiently we will need some financial support. 
         Through early June most of the work will be done using e-mail. E-mail, 
         unfortunately, is a very sterile medium for the creative exchange of ideas. 
         ( It is also very easy to procrastinate if E-mail is the only means of 
         communication.)</p>
       <p> We have 8 separate working groups and anticipate costs for 1 or 2 conference 
         calls. As the materials from each group become formed, we will need to 
         meet again. Our preliminary plans are to meet at the Brookings Institute 
         in Washington, DC. Whatever support the two societies can give for that 
         event will be greatly appreciated. We have tried to hold meetings in conjunction 
         with other professional conferences. The organizations we work for would 
         provide support for our attendance at these meetings. There is no Software 
         Engineering, Computer Science or computer ethics meeting scheduled for 
         early Fall that most of us would be attending. </p>
       <p>After planning how to develop each working group's product, we devoted 
         some of the meeting to planning how best to integrate the working group's 
         products into a single well-formed document. We believe it is best to 
         turn the results of the several groups over to a single skilled writer 
         who, acting as a scribe, will be responsible for will be responsible for 
         organizing the multiple documents into a single product. As we talked 
         of this task, we realized that it would take several weeks of concerted 
         effort from the scribe. As volunteers, we devote pieces of our time to 
         the work of the professional societies. The task of the scribe is a full-time 
         job for several weeks and we would like the societies, jointly, to provide 
         an honorarium to the person who acts as scribe.</p>
       <p> At the moment, the committee would like Professor Keith Miller to be 
         the scribe. He is a practicing software engineer who has had contracts 
         with NASA and published widely on software testing. He is also a university 
         professor teaching computer science and working in the area of computer 
         ethics. The plan we developed call for working groups to have completed 
         preliminary materials by July 15th available for the scribe. The scribe 
         would work on the documents and return them to the working groups for 
         another iteration by August 15, Each working group would then edit and 
         modify there document based on input from the working group members and 
         return their documents through me ,to the scribe for further revision 
         and integration. This process would go through one or two iterations.</p>
       <p> The plan then calls for a meeting in Washington in October or November 
         to have the group do a final run through of the document. Because of the 
         location, we hope to involve one or two people from each of the societies 
         boards in that review process. After further revision we plan to deliver 
         the document to the steering committee. After their review, we would like 
         to follow a process that was helpful in developing the ACM Code of ETHICS 
         and Guidelines for Professional Conduct. Namely, we would like to submit 
         the document to the membership for review and comment by publishing it 
         in the Communications of the ACM and in IEEE Computer.</p>
       <p> The comment process is facilitated by the inclusion of a turn-around 
         document attached to the article in the magazines. Please let me know 
         what you think of these plans. Sincerely, Don Gotterbarn Co-chair IEEE-CS/ACM 
         Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices. </p>
