       <p><strong>PREAMBLE</strong><br>
   The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction;
     the clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details
     of how these aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals.
     Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without
     the details, the aspirations can become high sounding but empty; together,
     the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.</p>
       <p>Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification,
         design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial
         and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the
         health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere
         to the following Eight Principles:</p>
       <p><strong>1 PUBLIC </strong>- Software engineers shall act consistently
         with the public interest.</p>
       <p><strong>2 CLIENT AND EMPLOYER</strong> - Software engineers shall act
         in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer
         and that is consistent with the public interest.</p>
       <p><strong>3 PRODUCT</strong> - Software engineers shall ensure that their
         products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards
         possible.</p>
       <p><strong>4 JUDGMENT </strong>- Software engineers shall maintain integrity
         and independence in their professional judgment.</p>
       <p><strong>5 MANAGEMENT</strong> - Software engineering managers and leaders
         shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management
         of software development and maintenance.</p>
       <p><strong>6 PROFESSION</strong> - Software engineers shall advance the
         integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public
         interest.</p>
       <p><strong>7 COLLEAGUES</strong> - Software engineers shall be fair to
         and supportive of their colleagues.</p>
       <p><strong>8 SELF</strong> - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong
         learning regarding the practice of their profession and promote an ethical
         approach to the practice of the profession.</p>

   SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE</strong></p>
       <p>IEEE-CS/ACM Joint Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
         Practices</p>
       <p>Full Version</p>
       <p><strong>PREAMBLE</strong></p>
       <p>Computers have a central and growing role in commerce, industry, government,
         medicine, education, entertainment and society at large. Software engineers
         are those who contribute by direct participation or by teaching, to the
         analysis, specification, design, development, certification, maintenance
         and testing of software systems. Because of their roles in developing
         software systems, software engineers have significant opportunities to
         do good or cause harm, to enable others to do good or cause harm, or
         to influence others to do good or cause harm. To ensure, as much as possible,
         that their efforts will be used for good, software engineers must commit
         themselves to making software engineering a beneficial and respected
         profession. In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall
         adhere to the following Code of Ethics and Professional Practice.</p>
       <p>The Code contains eight Principles related to the behavior of and decisions
         made by professional software engineers, including practitioners, educators,
         managers, supervisors and policy makers, as well as trainees and students
         of the profession. The Principles identify the ethically responsible
         relationships in which individuals, groups, and organizations participate
         and the primary obligations within these relationships. The Clauses of
         each Principle are illustrations of some of the obligations included
         in these relationships. These obligations are founded in the software
         engineer=s humanity, special care owed to people affected by the work
         of software engineers, and the unique elements of the practice of software
         engineering. The Code prescribes these as obligations of anyone claiming
         to be or aspiring to be a software engineer.</p>
       <p>It is not intended that the individual parts of the Code be used in
         isolation to justify errors of omission or commission. The list of Principles
         and Clauses is not exhaustive. The Clauses should not be read as separating
         the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct in all practical
         situations. The Code is not a simple ethical algorithm which generates
         ethical decisions. In some situations standards may be in tension with
         each other or with standards from other sources. These situations require
         the software engineer to use ethical judgment to act in a manner which
         is most consistent with the spirit of the Code of Ethics and Professional
         Practice, given the circumstances.</p>
       <p>Ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful consideration of
         fundamental principles, rather than blind reliance on detailed regulations.
         These Principles should influence software engineers to consider broadly
         who is affected by their work; to examine if they and their colleagues
         are treating other human beings with due respect; to consider how the
         public, if reasonably well informed, would view their decisions; to analyze
         how the least empowered will be affected by their decisions; and to consider
         whether their acts would be judged worthy of the ideal professional working
         as a software engineer. In all these judgments concern for the health,
         safety and welfare of the public is primary; that is, the APublic Interest@
         is central to this Code.</p>
       <p> <br>
   The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering requires a code that
     is adaptable and relevant to new situations as they occur. However, even
     in this generality, the Code provides support for software engineers and
     managers of software engineers who need to take positive action in a specific
     case by documenting the ethical stance of the profession. The Code provides
     an ethical foundation to which individuals within teams and the team as a
     whole can appeal. The Code helps to define those actions that are ethically
     improper to request of a software engineer or teams of software engineers.</p>
       <p>The Code is not simply for adjudicating the nature of questionable acts;
         it also has an important educational function. As this Code expresses
         the consensus of the profession on ethical issues, it is a means to educate
         both the public and aspiring professionals about the ethical obligations
         of all software engineers.</p>
       <p><br>
           <strong>PRINCIPLES</strong></p>
       <p><strong>Principle 1</strong> PUBLIC Software engineers shall act consistently
         with the public interest. In particular, software engineers shall, as
         appropriate:</p>
       <p>1.01. Accept full responsibility for their own work.<br>
   1.02. Moderate the interests of the software engineer, the employer, the client
     and the users with the public good.<br>
   1.03. Approve software only if they have a well?founded belief that it is safe,
   meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality
   of life or privacy or harm the environment. The ultimate effect of the work
   should be to the public good.<br>
   1.04. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential
   danger to the user, the public, or the environment, that they reasonably believe
   to be associated with software or related documents.<br>
   1.05. Cooperate in efforts to address matters of grave public concern caused
   by software, its installation, maintenance, support or documentation.<br>
   1.06. Be fair and avoid deception in all statements, particularly public ones,
   concerning software or related documents, methods and tools.<br>
   1.07. Consider issues of physical disabilities, allocation of resources, economic
   disadvantage and other factors that can diminish access to the benefits of
   software.<br>

   employer promptly if, in their opinion, a project is likely to fail, to prove
   too expensive, to violate intellectual property law, or otherwise to be problematic.<br>
   2.07. Identify, document, and report significant issues of social concern,
   of which they are aware, in software or related documents, to the employer
   or the client.<br>
   2.08. Accept no outside work detrimental to the work they perform for their
   primary employer.<br>
   2.09. Promote no interest adverse to their employer or client, unless a higher
   ethical concern is being compromised; in that case, inform the employer or
   another appropriate authority of the ethical concern.</p>
