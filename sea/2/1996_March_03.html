       <p>Dear Work Group Leaders,<br>
       </p>
       <p>Below is an expansion of the detailed schedule which we developed at
         our meeting in Philadelphia. At the meeting;
         I indicated that would like to micro-manage the project for awhile, so
         please send me copies of items marked with an asterisk. I am sorry for
         the short turn around this week, but I am leaving the country for a week
         on the 9th of March, and I do not want to delay things because of my
         travel. We have the plan and once we start to follow it, interest in
         and support for the project will start to increase. </p>
       <p>best regards,<br>
   don</p>
       <p> * March 1:<br>
   Send a &quot;hello message&quot; to your working group; let them know that
   we are about to start and thank them for their continued interest in this project.
   * March 4-6<br>
   Develop material specifically for your group which:<br>
   1 contains a statement of purpose for our task force (distributed to you on
   disk at meting) &amp; a straw man copy of the purpose of your working group.
   Invite comment from them on this, SEEPP Purpose Esc :--&#8226; </p>

   Software engineers make value-laden decisions that affect health, safety, welfare
     and environment. Standards and principles of ethical and professional practices
     will guide software engineers making these decisions. SEEPP Scope: standards,
     guidelines and recommended practices of ethical and professional practices
     for software engineering</p>
       <p> 2 Explain the difference between standards of ethics, standards of
         conduct, and standards of practice. Request their input about issues
         in your working group's domain which fit any or all of these types of
         standards. They need not worry about which category to put them in. We
         will take care of that. See 3 below For example: Most professions distinguish
         between standards of ethics, conduct and practice. These standards include
         a range of statements, Standards of ethics are generally broad and aspirational
         and do not prescribe specific behaviors -prevent harm. Standards of conduct
         are more specific and . 2t=sperm-pari~e - 20 .... .be#awes---~p`~`rm-:Standards-of-conduct
         are -mor-a-gp^c; f; and standards of practice are regulative-do not release
         a product which has not been adequately tested. Violating this later
         type of standard is generally a foundation for legal action. These three
         types of standards exist for people as members of a'profession, employees,
         and as individuals. We are looking for a range of statements and examples
         of these types of standards as they apply to professional competence.
         ((my working group )) Please send any examples of these you can think
         of. They can be one line statements or paragraphs. We are trying to brainstorm
         the standards on email. I will organize your coritributions and circulate
         the organized list to all of you for further comment.</p>
       <p> 3. The material generated by the working group members will be sifted
         by you and recirculated in an organized form to them for further comment.<br>
   March 8<br>
   Don will put his two cents in to coordinate all these materials that you have
   sent and share other's insights among work group leaders. If you do not hear
   from him by the 8th, he probably has nothing to say. Proceed to March 15th
