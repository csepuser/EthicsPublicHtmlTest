       <p>I took the task of summarizing two codes of ethics of other organizations
         and review a text on Microsoft Certification for systems engineers. Don
         provided me
 with the two codes of ethics. Unfortounatly, I could not cjain access to the
 text
 on Microsoft certification, but I did get some idea about the process through
 Microsoft's Web pages. The certification as I can see is mainly concerned with
 'competence' in Microsoft products! I did not persue that line any further since
 I
 do not think it would provide help to us in our generic coverage of compitence.
         <br>
         <br>
         Since the two codes mainly deal with ethics, not enough information was found
   on competence. Thinking about the issue I can say that I beleive in the
   following formula for competence:<br>
   Competence = expertise &lt; knowledge &lt; proper academic preperation
   (where '&lt;' is read as &quot;is acheived through&quot;)<br>
   <br>
   Going to the source (i.e., proper academic preperation) I do not find any other
   profession full of &quot;hackers&quot; working professionally as in software
   engineering?!
   I beleive that all other professions that stress on eeMpetence through certification
   or other means require that the applicant be holding an academic
   degree (underqi-aduate and/or graduate) in the corresponding field. You will
   not
   field someone applying to take the CPA exam, the National Board exams in Medicine,
   or PE without being an accountant, a medical doctor, or an engineer
   respectively.
       <p>I'm not saying that competence can only be ensured through examinations.
         To me, it
     would be a waste of time and effort to examine a graduate of a good, accredited
     department! This takes us to what I think is proper for us to consider when
     addressing the issue of &quot;competence&quot; and ensuring proper academic
     preperation. A
     competent SE should have adequately covered the five areas of concentration
     as recommended in by the IEEE-CS/ACM joint task force report called: Computing
     Curricula
     '91. I strongly beleive that any SE who earned an academic degree that
     follows the guidelines of computing Curricula '91 should be competent. What
     level of comptence? That can be quantified with the GPA or through an examination
     process.
     It is my opinion that when we address competence, we should make reference
     to the SOLID guidelines of the Computing Curricula '91 (and subsequent versions.)
     If we succeed to put this in our standard, we will not hear the word hackers
     in industry as much as we do nowadays.<br>
     <br>
     In both codes of ethics, I summarized by deleting words, sentences while.teXmag-eare
       of preserving the intended purpose of the original text. The summaries
       provided here are not rewordings of the original text. This was done to
     cut on time!
       I hope that this message will help stimulate the discussion and urge us
     to do some
       more work :)<br>
       Amr<br>
       -----------------------= 1st code mostly ethical =----_____________<br>
       The first code of ethics is that of the International Association of Business
       Communicators. As the name implies, it is mostly ethical. Many of those
       issues are applicable
       to almost any profession including SE. I have summarized
       the important points mentioned in the code that I felt would be applicable
       to SE ethics.<br>
       THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BUSINESS COMMUNICATORS CODE OF ETHICS<br>
       The IABC Code of Ethics has been developed to provide IABC members and
       other communication professionals with guidelines of professional behavior
       and standards of ethical practice. The Code will be reviewed and revised
       as necessary by the Ethics Committee and the Executive Board.<br>
       COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION<br>
       1. Communication professionals will uphold the credibility and<br>
       dignity of their profession by:<br>
       * encouraging the practice of honest, candid, and timely communication.<br>
       2. Professional communicators will not use any information that has been
       generated or appropriately acquired by a business for another business &quot;without
       permission.&quot;<br>
       STANDARDS OF CONDUCT<br>
       --More-<br>
       3. All interrational, national, and local laws and regulations must be
       observed, with particular attention to those pertaining to communication,
       such as copyright law. Industry and<br>
       organizational regulations will also be observed.<br>
       4. Communication professionals will not condone any illegal or unethical
       act related to their professional activity, their organization and its
       business or the public environment in which it operates. The communicator
       should speak with his or her supervisor or appropriate authorities--depending
       on the context of the situation and one's own ethical judgment.<br>
       CONFIDENTIALITY/DISCLOSURE<br>
       5. Communication professionals will respect the confidentiality and right-to-privacy
       of all individuals, employers, clients and customers. Communicators must
       determine the ethical balance between right<br>
       to-privacy and need-to-know..--More--6. Communication professionals will
       not use any confidential information gained as a result of professional
       activity
       for personal benefit or for that of others.<br>
       PROFESSIONALISM<br>
       7. Members should acknowledge that their actions reflect on themselves,
       their organizations and their profession.<br>
       ------------------------------------------<br>
       A SYSTEM OF ENACTMENT<br>
       The code must reinforce the observance of all civil and criminal laws and
       regulations, yet be flexible enough for situational considerations and
       for seeking reform through legitimate channels.      
       <p>
         <strong>Communication</strong><br>
         The code should be published, along with supplementary materials --More--and
       a brief reference bibliography, in a folder given to each member on a one-time
       basis. New members Joining the organization should automatically receive
       a Code on joining.<br>
       Include a sentence on all applications and annual renewal forms stating, &quot;I
       have reviewed and pledge to uphold IABC's code of ethics and standards
       of professional conduct.&quot; At least one session about
       ethics should be scheduled at the IABC annual conference to assist newer
       professionals in developing and refining their
       communication
       ethics, education and professional development.      
       <p><strong>Review Committee</strong><br>
         Establish an ethics review committee of at least three accredited members.
           Non-accredited members may be appointed upon special approval by the
           IABC Executive and the director representing ethics on the Executive
           Board. The first function should be to offer an IABC member service
           in --More--assisting with general ethical questions related to the
           profession. The second function of the review committee would be the
           professional development of members on the subject of ethics,<br>
       working in conjunction with IABC's professional development committee.
       The third function should be to review and sanction violations of ethical
       conduct
       among members as they reflect on IABC and the communication profession.      
       <p>
         <strong>Sanctions </strong>      
         <br>
         It is recognized that, while the code may apply to communication<br>
         professionals generally, sanctions would apply only to IABC members.<br>
         For a first violation, unless criminal activity is involved, the sanctions
       would be informative and educational. They would share concern over the
         situation, rendering opinions with the intent to help guide the
         member toward more professional guidance. A second violation for the
         same or related offense would bring a warning, again with the intent
         of information
         and education. A third or subsequent violation could involve a further
         warning, or if the situation were flagrant without serious commitment
         of improvement,
       an alternative sanction of suspension for up to one year could be given.
       Any
       decision
       of suspension or reinstatement must be reviewed and approved by
       the IABC
       Executive Committee and the executive board director responsible.<br>

         __________= 2nd code mostly ethical with a few exceptions = The second
       code is of the American Institute for Conservation/Code of Ethics &amp; Guidelines
       for Practice. Again, it is mostly ethical but lots of issues can be applied
       to the practice of SE.
       I have commented next to such points in uppercase letters to mention the
       corresponding SE activity most suitable for applying the point. In many
       cases I have used quotation marks to highlight important concepts within
       the point.<br>

       CODE OF ETHICS &amp; GUIDELINES FOR PRACTICE<br>
       <strong>Preamble</strong><br>
       The primary goal of conservation professionals, individuals with extensive
       training and special expertise, is the preservation of cultural property.<br>
       <strong>Code of Ethics</strong><br>
       I. The conservation professional shall strive to attain the highest possible
       standards in all aspects of conservation, including, but not limited to,
       preventive conservation, examination, documentation, treatment, research,
       and education..--More-- <br>
       II.The conservation professional shall have an informed respect for the
         cultural property, its unique character and significance,
         and the people
         or person who created it.<br>
         III. While recognizing the right of society to make appropriate and respectful
         use of cultural property, the conservation professional shall serve as
         an advocate for the preservation of cultural property.<br>
         IV. The conservation professional shall practice &quot;within the limits
         of personal competence and education as well as within the limits of the
         available facilities.&quot;<br>
         V. While circumstances may limit the resources allocated to a particular
         situation, &quot;the
         quality of work that the conservation professional performs shall not be
         compromised.&quot;<br>
         VI. The conservation professional &quot;must strive to select methods and
         materials that, to the best of current knowledge&quot;, do not adversely
         affect cultural property or its future examination, scientific investigation,
         treatment, or function.<br>
         VI. More--The conservation professional &quot;shall document&quot; examination,
         scientific investigation, and treatment by creating permanent records and
         reports.<br>
         VIII. The conservation professional shall recognize a responsibility
         for preventive conservation by endeavoring to limit damage or deterioration
         to cultural
         property.<br>
         IX. The conservation professional shall treat all professional relationships
         with honesty and respect, seek to ensure the rights and opportunities

         X. The conservation professional shall endeavor to &quot;contribute&quot; to
         the evolution and growth of the profession, a field of study that encompasses
         the liberal arts and the natural sciences. This contribution may be made
         by such means as continuing development of personal skills
         and knowledge, sharing of information and experience with colleagues,
         adding to the profession's written body of knowledge, and providing and
         promoting educational opportunities in the
         field .<br>
         ...[deleted stuff]<br>
         XII. The conservation professional shall practice in a manner
         that<br>
         minimizes personal risks and hazards to co-workers, the public, and the
         environment.<br>
         XIII. Each conservation professional has the obligation to promote understanding
         of and adherence to this Code of Ethics.
       <p>
         <strong>Guidelines for Practice</strong><br>
         The conservation professional should use the following guidelines and
         supplemental commentaries together with the AIC Code of Ethics in the
         pursuit of ethical
       practice. The commentaries are separate documents, :rested by
       the AIC membership, that are intended to amplify this document and to accommodate
       growth and change in the field.<br>
       <strong>1. Professional Conduct-Misconduct:</strong> Adherence to the Code
       of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice is a matter of personal responsibility.<br>
       <strong>2. Disclosure: </strong>In professional relationships, the conservation
       professional should share complete and accurate information relating to
       the efficacyand value of materials and procedures.<br>
       <strong>3.</strong> <strong>Laws and Regulations</strong>: The conservation
       professional should be cognizant of laws and regulations that may have
       a bearing on professional activity.<br>
       <strong>4. Practice:</strong> Regardless of the nature of employment, the
       conservation professional should follow appropriate standards for safety,
       security, contracts, fees, and advertising.<br>
       <strong>5. Communication: </strong>Communication between the conservation
       professional and the owner, custodian, or authorized agent of the cultural
       property is essential to ensure an agreement that reflects shared decisions
       and realistic expectations.<br>
       <strong>6. Consent: </strong>The conservation professional should act only
       with the consent of the owner, custodian, or authorized agent.<br>
       <strong>7. Confidentiality:</strong> Except as provided in the Code of
       Ethics and Guidelines for Practice, the conservation professional should
       consider relationships with an owner, custodian, or authorized agent as
       confidential.<br>
       <strong>8. Supervision:</strong> The conservation professional is responsible
       for work delegated to other professionals, students, interns, volunteers,
       subordinates, or agents and assignees.<br>
       <strong>9. Education: </strong>Within the limits of knowledge, ability,
       time, and facilities, the conservation professional is encouraged to become
       involved in the education of conservation personnel.<br>
       <strong>10. Consultation: </strong>Since no individual can be expert in
       every aspect of conservation, it may be appropriate to consult with colleagues
       or, in some instances, to refer the owner, custodian, or authorized agent
       to a professional who is more experienced or better equipped to accomplish
       the required work. If the owner requests a second opinion, this request
       must be respected.<br>
       <strong>11. Recommendations and References:</strong> The conservation professional
       should provide recommendations without direct knowledge of a colleague's
       competence and experience.<br>
       <strong>12. Adverse Commentary: </strong>A conservation professional may
       be required to testify in legal, regulatory, or administrative proceedings
       concerning allegations of unethical conduct.<br>
       <strong>13. Misconduct: </strong>Allegations of unethical conduct should
       be reported in writing to the AIC president.<br>
       <strong>14. Conflict of Interest:</strong> The conservation professional
       should avoid situations in which there is a potential for a conflict of
       interest that may affect the quality of work, lead to the dissemination
       of false information, or give the appearance of impropriety.<br>
       <strong>15. Related Professional Activities:</strong> The conservation
       professional<br>
       should be especially mindful of the considerable potential for conflict
       of interest in activities such as authentication, appraisal, or art dealing.<br>
       Examination and Scientific Investigation.<br>
       <strong>16. Justification: </strong>Careful examination of cultural property
       forms the basis for all future action by the conservation professional.
