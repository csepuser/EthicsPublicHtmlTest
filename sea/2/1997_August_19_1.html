                     <br>
 
                     There have been several responses to version 2.1 of the draft 
 
                     Software Engineering Code. Most of them have been quite favourable. 
 
                     In Corfu, the International federation of Information Processing 
 
                     Working Group 9 viewed the code quite positively.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     You have all worked quite hard on this project and now I need 
 
                     two more things from you. It is time to develop version 3 
 
                     of the Code. Below is a survey to solicit your opinions about 
 
                     the suggested changes to version </p>
 
                   <p>2.1. We are on a tight schedule so please vote yes or no. 
 
                     If you don't like a phrase then please suggest a better one.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     Version 3 of the Code is scheduled to be printed in IEEE Computer 
 
                     in October and the Communications of the ACM in November. 
 
                     The function of the publication is to solicit opinions on 
 
                     the Code from the memberships of the two societies. I need 
 
                     a positive response from each of you that you want your name 
 
                     associated with the code and listed officially in these publications 
 
                     as part of the task force that developed the code. If I don't 
 
                     receive a positive response from you that you want your name 
 
                     listed than it will not be included in the list.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     From all the comments I have received, you can be proud of 
 
                     your work on this!!!<br>

                     Task Force and the work of the group..Note tho, on my name,

                     <br>
 
                     PREAMBLE v (2.last)<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, 
 
                     industry, government, medicine, education, entertainment, 
 
                     social affairs, and ordinary life. Those who contribute, by 
 
                     direct participation or by teaching, to the design and development 
 
                     of software systems have significant opportunities both to 
 
                     do good or to cause harm, and to influence and enable others 
 
                     to do good or cause harm. To assure, as<br>
 
                     much as possible, that this power will be used for good, software 
 
                     engineers must commit themselves to making the design and 
 
                     development of software a beneficial and respected profession. 
 
                     In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall 
 
                     adhere to the following Code of Ethics.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     The Code contains eight Principles related to the behavior 
 
                     of and decisions made by professional software engineers, 
 
                     be they practitioners, educators, managers and supervisors, 
 
                     or policy makers, as well as trainees and students of the 
 
                     profession. The Principles identify the various relationships 
 
                     in which individuals, groups, and<br>
 
                     organizations participate and the primary obligations within 
 
                     these relationships.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     Each Principle of this code addresses three levels of ethical 
 
                     obligation owed by professional software engineers in each 
 
                     of these relationships. The first level identified is a set 
 
                     of ethical values, which professional software engineers share 
 
                     with all other human beings by virtue of their humanity. The 
 
                     second level obliges software<br>
 
                     engineering professionals to more challenging obligations 
 
                     than those required at level one. Level two obligations are 
 
                     required because. professionals owe special care to people 
 
                     affected by their work.<br>
 
                     The third and deeper level comprises several obligations which 
 
                     derive<br>
 
                     directly from elements unique to the professional practice 
 
                     of software<br>
 
                     engineering. The Clauses of each Principle are illustrations 
 
                     of the various<br>
 
                     levels of obligation included in that relationship.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     The Clauses under each Principle consist of three different 
 
                     types of statement corresponding to each level. Level One: 
 
                     Aspire (to be human); statements of aspiration provide vision 
 
                     and objectives and are intended to direct professional behavior. 
 
                     These directives require significant ethical judgement. Level 
 
                     Two: Expect (to be professional); Statements of expectation 
 
                     express the obligations of all professionals and professional 
 
                     attitudes. Again, they do not describe the specific<br>
 
                     behavior details, but they clearly indicate professional responsibilities 
 
                     in computing. Level Three: Demand (to use good practices); 
 
                     statements of demand assert more specific behavioral responsibilities 
 
                     within software engineering, which are more closely related 
 
                     to the current state of the art. The range of statements is 
 
                     from the more general aspirational statement to specific measurable 
 
                     requirements.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     Although all three levels of professional obligation are recognized, 
 
                     the Code is not intended to be all inclusive, nor is it intended 
 
                     that its individual parts be used in isolation to justify 
 
                     errors of omission or commission. The list of Principles and 
 
                     Clauses is not exhaustive, and should not be read as separating 
 
                     the acceptable from the unacceptable in professional conduct 
 
                     in all practical situations. The Code is not a simple ethical 
 
                     algorithm which generates ethical decisions. In some situations<br>
 
                     standards may conflict with each other or with standards from 
 
                     other sources. These situations require the software engineer 
 
                     to use ethical judgement to act in a manner which is most 
 
                     consistent with the spirit of the Code of Ethics, given the 
 
                     circumstances.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     These ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful 
 
                     consideration of fundamental principles, rather than reliance 
 
                     on detailed regulations. These Principles should influence 
 
                     you to consider broadly who is affected by your work; to examine 
 
                     if you and your colleagues are treating other human beings 
 
                     with due respect; to speculate on how the public would view 
 
                     your decision if they were reasonably well informed; to analyze 
 
                     how the least empowered will be affected by your decision; 
 
                     and to consider if your acts would be considered worthy of 
 
                     the ideal professional working<br>
 
                     as a software engineer. Since this code represents a consensus 
 
                     of those engaged in the profession one should take into account 
 
                     what is likely to be judged as the most ethical way to act 
 
                     in the circumstances by informed, respected, and experienced 
 
                     peers in possession of all the facts and only depart from 
 
                     such a course for profound reasons, backed with careful judgement..</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     The dynamic and demanding context of software engineering 
 
                     requires a code that is adaptable and relevant to new situations 
 
                     as they occur. However even in this generality, the code provides 
 
                     support for the software engineer who needs to take positive 
 
                     action by documenting the ethical stance of the profession; 
 
                     it provides an ethical foundation to which individuals within 
 
                     teams and the team as a whole can appeal. The code also helps 
 
                     to define those things which are ethically improper to<br>
 
                     request of an software engineer.<br>
 
                     <br>
 
                     The code has an educational function, stating what is required 
 
                     of anyone wishing to join or continue in the software engineering 
 
                     community. Because it expresses the consensus of the profession 
 
                     on ethical issues, it can be used as a guide to decision making 
 
                     and as means to educate both the public and aspiring professionals 
 
                     about the professional obligation of all software engineers.<br>

                     1.07. Ensure realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, personnel, 
 
                     and outcome on any project on which they work or propose to

                     2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual 
 
                     or potential danger that they reasonably believe to be associated 
 
                     with the software or related documents on which they work, 
 
                     or are aware of, may pose to the user, a third party, or the 
 
                     environment.<br>
 
                     2.02. Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief 
 
                     that it is safe, meets specifications, has passed appropriate 
 
                     tests, and does not diminish quality of life or harm the environment.<br>
 
                     2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared under 
 
                     their supervision or within their areas of competence and

                     each individual should represent no interest adverse to their 
 
                     employer individually, so collectively it should be their
