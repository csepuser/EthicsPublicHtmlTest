      <p>Dennis,</p>
      <p>The IEEE Computer Society was informed on July 7, 2000 (see letter below)
        that the ACM was withdrawing from SWECC. Our withdrawal was effective
        that date. It is inappropriate for IEEE-CS to be asking for ACM representation
        on SWECC.</p>
      <p>Regarding on-going activities, ACM is continuing to fund the curriculum
        work led by Richard LeBlanc and managed by the Education Board. It is
        continuing to fund ethics work through the ACM Committee on Professional
        Ethics. ACM is working with many societies on the Information Technology
        Profession Initiative. Both Bruce Eisenstein (IEEE President) and Doris
        Carver (past IEEE-CS) are on the Steering Committee.</p>
      <p>Barbara Simons is following up with Guylaine Pollack on behalf of the
        Executive Committee to ensure any remaining issues around our withdrawal
        from SWECC are resolved.</p>

        Washington D.C.</p>
      <p>Dear Guylaine,</p>
      <p>In a vote completed June 30, 2000 the Council of the ACM has (without
        objection) directed that the Association withdraw from the Software Engineering
        Coordinating Committee (SWECC). This action was taken after 18 months
        of evaluation of the goals, direction, and progress of SWECC and its
        various projects. Accordingly, this letter is to inform you that ACM
        is withdrawing from SWECC. A full report on our decision to withdraw
        will be made available shortly. A summary of the ACM position is included
        with this letter. </p>
      <p>While the decision to withdraw from SWECC has been made, the Executive
        Committee of the ACM is eager to explore new ways of working together
        with the Computer Society to make substantive progress on the problem
        of improving the quality of software systems and the capabilities of
        software engineers. The Executive Committee feels there are areas in
        which on-going activities should continue (e.g. education and curricula)
        and new areas in which joint projects and initiatives should be considered.
        (e.g. the Information Technology Profession Initiative). Representatives
        of the Executive Committee will be at the upcoming Snowbird Conference
        and look forward to having informal conversations with the Computer Society
        about new ways of working together on this difficult, but important,
        problem. </p>

        Sent: Tuesday, October 31, 2000 5:36 PM<br>
        To: Bourne, Steve; White, John<br>
        Cc: ACM Executive Committee; ACM Council<br>
        Subject: Completing the ACM pullout of SWEcc</p>
      <p>Because the IEEE Computer Society executive board meets next week and
        will address this matter, I recommend immediate attention.</p>
      <p>The bylaws of SWEcc, to which ACM and IEEE Computer Society mutually
        agreed several years ago, call for an ACM representative to become chair
        of SWEcc as of January 1, 2001, for a 2 year period. (SWEcc is the software
        engineering coordinating committee, under the auspices of which there
        are four projects associated with establishing software engineering as
        a profession.)</p>
      <p>Although the ACM Council, under the previous executive committee, announced
        its intention to pull out of SWEcc on June 30, 2000, the details of making
        this happen were left to the next executive committee and nothing formal
        has been proposed or agreed to by the ACM and the Computer Society. ACM&#8217;s
        announced intention was to seek an arrangement that would preserve some
        of the projects currently under SWEcc. The position of the computer society
        seems to be that SWEcc remains a formal entity chartered by both societies
        to oversee these projects and will proceed as currently established until
        the Society and ACM agree to a resolution of this issue.</p>
      <p>In the absense of such an agreement by January 1, ACM will be obligated
        to provide a chair of SWEcc. I have received a request from the computer
        society to identify whom the chair will be, presumably so that an orderly
        transition of responsibility may take place. As ACM&#8217;s primary representative
        to SWEcc, that obligation would fall on me, barring a change in ACM&#8217;s
        representation or a formal resolution of the ACM withdrawal proposal. </p>
      <p>I am not willing to serve in that capacity when my sole purpose as ACM&#8217;s
        representative would be to dismantle something I have spent 7 years building
        on ACM&#8217;s behalf. I continue to believe that deciding to withdraw
        was a mistake on ACM&#8217;s part. </p>
      <p>I would be happy to provide my insight on these matters or my perspective
        on the background if the new executive committee needs this information.
        In any case, I urge that action should be taken to resolve this issue,
        since otherwise it leaves ACM in an awkward position at best.</p>
      <p>Regards, DJF<br>
