       <p align="justify">Dennis,</p>
       <p align="justify"> You are not going to be happy with the level of detail
         that follows. Every thing must be prefaced by: I am now in Leesburg VA
         teaching at George Washington University while on Sabatical leave. I
         will be here until January 2, 1997 when I go to England for six months
         to work with The Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility, a british
         computer ethics center. Part of my plan is to work with the director
         of the centre and some other to revise and and review task force documents.
         Part of the plan ( as a result of the responses from the working groups)
         is to write some of the preliminary documents.</p>
       <p align="justify">This is my first sabatcial and it is an organization
         nightmare. Some of the names and email address you requested are locked
         in a file cabinet in Tennessee but they are also in one box or another
         of materials I have been forwarding to England. I.e., can't be specific
         just yet. Both the IEE and the BCS representative have written articles
         for the proceedings of the PASE conference describing what they are doing
         in terms of professionism. My presentation about the IEEE?CS/ACM effort
         is also included as &quot;Establishing Standards of Professional Practice&quot; in
         The Responsible Software Engineer, edited by Colin Meyer and Tracy Hall
         forthcoming from Springer?Verlag. The technical paper I presented at
         the conference &quot;Software Engineering: The New Professionalism&quot; will
         also be included in the book. A paper I alluded to in message two relating
         to educating people about the types and roles of professional codes of
         conduct is forthcoming as &quot;an evolution of computing's codes of
         ethics and professional conduct&quot; in Seminars in Computing edited
         by David Preston Abacus Press. Let me try to fill in your template now. <br>

 &gt; Summary of Interaction(s): <br>
 &gt; - I did not get the same response from the IEE.<br>
 &gt; (please clarify what you did talk about with them, who was involved, etc.
 I was looking for guidance on the development of standards and soliciting their
 participation in the development and the review process. The individual I spoke
 with declined the offer and indicated that such participation was not a high
 priority for IEE.</p>

   This does not fit easily into your template. First week of November I am <br>
   going to a computer ethics conference and will do some specific <br>
   recruiting, in particular I want to involve people from the US based <br>
   center for Computing and Social Values. Later in November in November I <br>
   am doing a videotape for the SEI on ethical issues in project management <br>
   and will take the opportunity to meet with some of my working group who <br>
   are centered in Pittsburgh. <br>
 &lt;? I know Pittsburgh is not a foreign country.</p>
       <p align="justify"><br>
   Sorry about the absence of names. I hope to get these soon.</p>
