                     we should approve this by November</p>
 
                   <p>Here are my comments on the proposed code of ethics.</p>
 
                   <p>In general, I think this expresses some good ideals, but 
 
                     is entirely<br>
 
                     impractical in a number of cases. The problem is that many 
 
                     of the things<br>
 
                     being proposed are vaguely defined, impossible to accomplish, 
 
                     or<br>
 
                     not under the control of the software engineer. A few others 
 
                     might<br>
 
                     not be generally accepted as the &quot;right&quot; thing to 
 
                     do.</p>
 
                   <p>Specific comments and suggestions are identified below.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt;CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;INTRODUCTION<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;Computers now have a central and growing role in 
 
                     commerce,<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;industry, government, medicine, entertainment, and 
 
                     ordinary life.<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; Because the utility of computers depends in large 
 
                     part on the<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;instructions written for them, those who design, 
 
                     develop, and<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;test software have enormous opportunities both to 
 
                     do good and to<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, that 
 
                     this power will<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;be used for good, software engineers commit themselves 
 
                     to making<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;the design, development, and testing of software 
 
                     a distinct,<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance 
 
                     with that<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the 
 
                     following<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;standards of conduct. The seven main paragraphs state 
 
                     general<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;rules.</p>
 
                   <p>The following sentence makes no sense to me:</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt;Each subsidiary clause is a specific application 
 
                     of its<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;general rule, one experience has shown needs express 
 
                     statement;<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;but no set of subsidiary clauses exhausts the general 
 
                     rule.</p>
 
                   <p><br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;Rule 1: PRODUCT. Software engineers shall, insofar 
 
                     as possible,<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;assure that the software on which they work is useful 
 
                     to public,<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;employer, customer, and user, completed on time and 
 
                     at reasonable<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;cost, and free of significant error. In particular, 
 
                     software<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; 1.01. Assure that specifications for software on<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; which they work have been put in writing,<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; satisfy the user's requirements, and have the<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; customer's approval.</p>
 
                   <p>I see no reason why the ETHICS would require that specifications 
 
                     be<br>
 
                     put in writing. And I do not believe a software engineer is 
 
                     in a position<br>
 
                     to assure that specifications have met the other criteria. 
 
                     Examples:<br>
 
                     - you are brought in to fix something where you have know 
 
                     knowledge<br>
 
                     of the history of its requirements<br>
 
                     - you are given the requirements by your organization and 
 
                     have no<br>
 
                     interface with the customer and do not know if the customer 
 
                     has<br>
 
                     approved</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.02. Assure that they understand fully the<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; specifications for software on which they work.<br>
 
                     Would that this were true. It never is in practice. Things 
 
                     are gray here.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.04. Assure proper goals and objectives for any<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; project on which they work.<br>
 
                     How can this be done? What is &quot;proper&quot;? By whose 
 
                     standards?</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.05. Assure proper development methodology on 
 
                     any<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; project on which they work.<br>
 
                     Same question as above.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.06. Assure proper management on any project on<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; which they work, including proper procedures<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; for control of quality and risk.<br>
 
                     This is patently impossible. A software engineer is not in 
 
                     a position to<br>
 
                     assure anything about management unless they are the management.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.07. Assure proper estimates of cost, schedule,<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; personnel, and outcome on any project on<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; which they work.<br>
 
                     Once again, what is &quot;proper&quot; and notwithstanding 
 
                     that, how can a software<br>
 
                     developer assure this in practice? Chances are they were added 
 
                     to the<br>
 
                     project long after estimates were done.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.08. Assure adequate documentation on any project<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; on which they work, including a log of<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; problems discovered and solutions adopted.<br>
 
                     This is determined by company processes and procedures and 
 
                     policies and<br>
 
                     specific customer requirmenets, not by software engineers 
 
                     desires.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.09. Assure proper testing, debugging, and review<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; of software and related documents on which<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; they work.<br>
 
                     What is &quot;proper&quot;?</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.10. Assure that software and related documents<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; on which they work respect the privacy of<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; those who will be subject to the software.<br>
 
                     This is vague and untestable. Who will be &quot;subject to 
 
                     the software&quot;?<br>
 
                     What does it mean to &quot;respect the privacy&quot;?</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.11 Assure that raw information used in software<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; is accurate, derives from a legitimate source,<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; and is used only in ways properly authorized.<br>
 
                     Assurance may be difficult.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.12. Assure ethical, economic, cultural, legal,<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; and environmental issues are properly<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; identified, defined, and addressed.<br>
 
                     Few software engineers even know what these issues are.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.13. Promote maximum productivity and minimum<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; cost to employer, customer, user, and public.<br>
 
                     A nice ideal.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 1.14. Avoid fads, departing from standard<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; practices only when justified.<br>
 
                     This is a judgement call. Highly inappropriate in a code of 
 
                     ethics.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;Rule 2: PUBLIC. Software engineers shall, in their 
 
                     professional<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;role, act only in ways consistent with the public 
 
                     safety, health<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;and welfare. In particular, software engineers shall:<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; 2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons any danger<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; that the software or related documents on<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; which they work may pose to the user, a third<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; party, or the environment.<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; 2.02. Approve software only if they have a well-documented<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; belief that it is safe, meets specifications, and<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; has passed all appropriate tests.<br>
 
                     This is too arbitrary. Why must their belief be well documented? 
 
                     Doesn't<br>
 
                     this depend on the intended use of the software? Doesn't &quot;safety&quot; 
 
                     also<br>
 
                     depend on the intended use?</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 2.03. Affix their signature only to documents<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; prepared under their supervision and within<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; their areas of competence.<br>
 
                     This would eliminate most documents one signs while seeking<br>
 
                     employment, such as non-disclosure agreements and<br>
 
                     various employment condition documents, such as intellectual 
 
                     property<br>
 
                     rights agreements.</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt;<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; 4.01. Provide service only in areas of competence.<br>
 
                     This would eliminate most practicing software engineers. I 
 
                     mean this.<br>
 
                     Who determines competence?</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 4.02. Assure that any document upon which they<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; rely has been approved by someone qualified<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; to approve it.<br>
 
                     And how are they to determine the qualifications of the person 
 
                     who<br>
 
                     approved a document that was prepared by another organization 
 
                     or<br>
 
                     a long time ago?</p>
 
                   <p>-- (snip) ---</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; their opinion, a project is likely to fail,<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; to prove too expensive, to violate copyright<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; laws, or otherwise to turn out badly.<br>
 
                     I assume client means employer in most cases.</p>
 
                   <p>-- snip --</p>
 
                   <p>&gt; &gt; 7.01. Improve their knowledge of recent<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; developments in the design, development, and<br>
 
                     &gt; &gt; testing of software and related documents.<br>
 
                     I don't see why this is required for them to be ethical.<br>
 
                     Ditto for the rest of this section. Sounds more like what 
 
                     one would<br>
 
                     expect for them to get a license, not to be considered ethical.</p>
