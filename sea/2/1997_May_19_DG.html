                   <p>We worked on Principles 3 and 4, with not as much success. 
 
                     We did identify several holes in the code. The format is the 
 
                     same as the last email on the first two Principles. </p>
 
                   <p>Random, but significant item,The Principles do not include 
 
                     a Professional- USER relation. We have to incorporate this 
 
                     into the other Principles or make another Principle.</p>
 
                   <p> Principle 3: JUDGMENT. </p>
 
                   <blockquote> 
 
                     <p>Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, (1) promote 
 
                       and protect both the independence of their professional 
 
                       judgment and their reputation for such judgment. In particular, 
 
                       software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
 
                     <p> 3.01 Maintain professional (2)objectivity with respect 
 
                       to any software or related documents they are asked to evaluate.</p>
 
                     <p>(3)2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared 
 
                       under their supervision and within their areas of competence. 
 
                     </p>
 
                     <p>3.02. Reject bribery.</p>
 
                     <p> 3.03. Accept no payback, kickback, or other payment from 
 
                       a third party to a contract, except with the knowledge and 
 
                       consent of all parties to the contract. </p>
 
                     <p>3.04. Accept payment from only one party for any particular 
 
                       project, or for services (4)specific to that project, except 
 
                       when the circumstances have been fully disclosed to the 
 
                       parties concerned and they have given their informed consent.</p>
 
                     <p> (5) 3.07. Disclose to all concerned parties those conflicts 
 
                       of interest that cannot reasonably be avoided or escaped 
 
                       (6) and aspire to resolve them.</p>
 
                     <p>(7) DELETE 3.05. Neither solicit nor accept a contract 
 
                       from a governmental body on which a principal or officer 
 
                       of their employer serves as a member. </p>
 
                     <p>3.06. (7a) Participate in no decision of a governmental 
 
                       or professional body, as a member or advisor, concerned 
 
                       with software, or related documents, in which they, their 
 
                       employer, or their client have a financial interest. (8)

                       talks about obligations between client and employer and 
 
                       emphasizes loyalty and not harming the other party unless 
 
                       required by concerns of public health, safety, and welfare. 
 
                       If this list is viewed as exclusive than it would seem we 
 
                       can &quot;sell a computer to Hitler&quot; since it will 
 
                       only be used to discriminate against a particular group..we 
 
                       need to fill out the list or make clear that it is not exhaustive.

                   <blockquote> 
 
                     <p>Software engineers shall, consistent with the public health, 
 
                       safety, and welfare, always act in professional matters 
 
                       as faithful agents and trustees of their client or employer. 
 
                       In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
 
                     <p> 4.01. Provide service only in areas of competence. </p>
 
                     <p>4.02. Assure that any document upon which they rely has 
 
                       been approved by someone (9)authorized to approve it.</p>
 
                     <p> 4.03. Use the property of a client or employer only in 
 
                       ways properly authorized(10), and with the client or employers 
 
                       knowledge and consent. . </p>
 
                     <p>4.04. Not knowingly use (11)pirated software on equipment 
 
                       of a client or employer or in work performed for a client 
 
                       or employer.</p>
 
                     <p> 4.05. Keep as confidential information gained in their 
 
                       professional work that is not (12) in the public domain 
 
                       (13)and is not inconsistent with matters of public concern. 
 
                     </p>
 
                     <p>4.06. Identify, document, (14) and report to employer or 
 
                       client any problem(15)s or matters of social concern in 
 
                       the software or related documents on which they work (16) 
 
                       or of which they are aware. </p>
 
                     <p>4.07. Inform client or employer promptly if, in their opinion, 
 
                       a project is likely to fail, to prove too expensive, to

                   </blockquote>
 
                   <p>Modification to Principles 3 and 4</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 3 talks about profession judgement. After clause 
 
                     3.01 which states the need for objective judgement, clause 
 
                     3.02 through clause 3.07 Sev1.0 deal with elimination of one 
 
                     type of external influence on judgement, specifically 
 
                     financial interference with objective judgement. Other pressures 
 
                     on objective 
 
                     judgement, e.g., political, and social, are not yet addressed 
 
                     in this principle. We should ask the task force for contributions 
 
                     here.</p>
 
                   <blockquote> 
 
                     <p>1. add 'promote and' to Principle 3 because as stated it 
 
                       simply indicates that we should merely try to hang on to 
 
                       professional judgement.</p>
 
                     <p> 2 replace 'skepticism' with 'objectivity', the latter 
 
                       being a less negative sentiment </p>
 
                     <p>3 move 2.30 to here, reflecting a specific type of significant 
 
                       judgement.</p>
 
                     <p> 4 replace 'related' with 'specific' . Ruling out related 
 
                       services means that a SE could not develop an area of work, 
 
                       like a specialty in radar systems, and than market that 
 
                       skill (which is related to a single product) to others.</p>
 
                     <p> 5 Reorganize principles 3.05-3.07 which deal with conflict 
 
                       of interest. Start with Principle 3.07 and expand 3.07 to 
 
                       address the objection &quot;that conflict of interest issues 
 
                       can be managed in a variety of ways and do not require complete 
 
                       exclusion&quot;</p>
 
                     <p> 6 and 'and aspire to resolve them' to meet a concern with 
 
                       complete exclusion as the only way to address conflict of 
 
                       interest.</p>
 
                     <p>7. Delete clause 3.05. This clause says that the SE should 
 
                       not behave in a way which might bring about this particular 
 
                       type of conflict of interest. It presupposes that absolute 
 
                       exclusion is the only way to address conflicts of interest. 
 
                       This presumption is inconsistent with the modification suggested 
 
                       for 3.07. This clause would rule out and member of the Board 
 
                       of Governours advocating the development of a funded task 
 
                       force addressing an issue in their own specialization.</p>
 
                     <p>7a This one strikes me as being as restrictive as 3.05 
 
                       and is still in need of modification. dg</p>
 
                     <p>8 Missing clauses- As this clause stands judgement is merely 
 
                       a technical thing and does not involve social issues only 
 
                       make judgements which can be publicly justified as in the 
 
                       best interest of quality of life, environment....be aware 
 
                       that all technical judgements impact other human beings, 
 
                       have stakeholders other than employer, client, and user. 
 
                       all technical judgements should be tempered and guided by 
 
                       the need to support and maintain human values. </p>
 
                     <p>9 replace qualified with authorized. This avoids question 
 
                       of how determine qualification-competence.</p>
 
                     <p>10 add ', and with the client or employers knowledge and 
 
                       consent.'</p>
 
                     <p> 11 replace pirated with a less idiomatic term, namely 
 
                       ??????????</p>
 
                     <p>12 delete word 'properly'</p>
 
                     <p>13 add 'and is not inconsistent with matters of public 
 
                       concern' because as stated, if some concentrated on the 
 
                       clause alone they might think it prohibits whistle blowing.</p>
 
                     <p>14 replace 'properly'</p>
 
                     <p>15 add 'or matters of social concern' because some might 
 
                       interpret 'problems' as referring exclusively to code bugs. 
 
                       This addition helps define the social responsibility of 
 
                       a professional software engineer.</p>
 
                     <p>16 add 'or of which they are aware' to clarify the broader 
 
                       responsibility of a professional to the whole of society.</p>
 
                     <p>17 replace 'violate copyright laws' with ' intellectual 
 
                       property legislation, in particular copyright , patent,

                     <p>18 Need to modify the expression 'turn out badly' ????????????</p>
 
                     <p>19. Replace consent with knowledge since as stated it would 
 
                       be unethical to whistle blow unless the employer consents. 
 
                       I am uncomfortable with the replacement ..any other ideas???? 
 
                     </p>
