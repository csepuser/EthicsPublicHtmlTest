       <p>Software Engineering Code of Ethics, Version 3.0<br>
 Don Gotterbarn, Keith Miller, and Simon Rogerson<br>
 IEEE-CS/ACM Joint Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
 Practices
       <p>In May of 1993, the Board of Governors of the IEEE-CS established a
         steering committee for evaluating, planning, and coordinating actions
         related to establishing software engineering as a profession. In that
         same year the ACM Council endorsed the establishment of a Commission
         on Software Engineering. By January of 1994, both societies formed a
         joint steering committee &quot;To establish the appropriate sets) of
         standards for professional practice of Software Engineering upon which
         industrial decisions, professional certification, and educational curricula
         can be based.&quot; To accomplish these tasks they made the following
         recommendations:</p>
       <p>1. adopt standard definitions<br>
   2. define required body of knowledge and recommended practices<br>
   3. define ethical standards<br>
   4. define educational curricula for undergraduate, graduate(MS) and continuing
   education (for retraining and migration)</p>
       <p>The steering committee decided to accomplish these tasks through the
         establishment of a series of task forces. Initially the task forces established
         were: Software Engineering Body of Knowledge and Recommended Practices;
         Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices, and Software
       Engineering Curriculum.</p>
       <p>The purpose of the Software Engineering ethics
           and professional practices task force is to document the ethical and
           professional responsibilities and obligations
     of software engineers. This draft code of ethics was developed by a task
         force of the joint IEEE Computer Society and Association for Computing
         Machinery
     Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering as a Profession
     and has been reviewed by the Steering Committee. The task force on Software
     Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices developed this code for a sub?specialization
     within the constituencies of both of the professional societies. In an attempt
     to reflect the international character of both organizations and the profession
     as a whole, the composition of the task force is multinational in both citizenship
     and in membership in professional computing organizations. The proposed draft
     Code of Ethics for Software Engineers (version 3) was developed by the task
     force and reviewed by the Steering Committee for distribution and comment.
     The purpose of this distribution is to solicit comments from practitioners
     and other interested parties.</p>
       <p>Codes, if carefully written and properly promoted,
           can be powerful instruments in the drive for professionalism and in
         establishing safeguards for society.
       They do not have to be and should not be sterile, which is often the perception
       that people have of them. This draft code evolved after extensive study
       of several computing engineering codes[l].</p>
       <p>All of these codes try to a
           educate and inspire the members of the professional group that adopts
           the code. Codes also inform the public about the responsibilities
         that are important to a profession. Codes instruct practitioners about
         the standards that society expects them to meet, and what their peers
         strive for and expect of each other. Codes are not meant to encourage
         litigation,
         and
         they are not legislation; but they do offer practical advice about issues
         that matter to professionals and their clients and they do inform policymakers.
         These concepts have been adopted in the development of this code. Based
         on
         the feedback from readers of this publication and from other sources,
         a final draft of the code will be developed and presented to the Steering
         Committee
         for approval.</p>

         Societies, Model Guide for Professional Conduct; Accreditation Board

       <p>PREAMBLE</p>
       <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, industry,
         government, medicine, education, entertainment, social affairs, and ordinary
         life. Those who contribute, by direct participation or by teaching, to
         the design and development of software systems have significant opportunities
         both to do good and to cause harm and to influence and enable others
         to do good or cause harm. To ensure, as much as possible, that this power
         will be used for good, software engineers must commit themselves to making
         the design and development of software beneficial and respected profession.
         In accordance with that commitment,.software engineers shall adhere to
       the following Code of Ethics.</p>
       <p>The Code contains eight Principles related
           to the behavior of and decisions made by professional software engineers,
           be they practitioners, educators,
     managers and supervisors, or policymakers, as well as trainees and students
     of the profession. The Principles identify the various relationships in which
     individuals, groups, and organizations participate and the primary obligations
     within these relationships.</p>
       <p>Each Principle of this code addresses three levels
           of ethical obligation owed by professional software engineers in each
           of these relationships. The
       first
       level identified is a set of ethical values, which professional software
       engineers share with all other human beings by virtue of their humanity.
       The second level
       obliges software engineering professionals to more challenging obligations
       than those required at level one. Level two obligations are required because
       professionals owe special care to people affected by their work. The third
       and deeper level comprises several obligations which derive directly from
       elements unique to the professional practice of software engineering. The
       Clauses of
       each Principle are illustrations of the various levels of obligation included
       in that relationship.</p>
       <p>The Clauses under each Principle consist of three
           different types of statement corresponding to each level. Level one:
           Aspire (to be human); statements
         of aspiration provide vision and objectives and are intended to direct
         professional behavior. These directives require significant ethical judgment.
         Level Two:
         Expect (to be professional); statements of expectation express the obligations
         of all professionals and professional attitudes. Again they do not describe
         the specific behavior details but they clearly indicate professional
         responsibilities in computing. Level Three: Demand (to use good practices);
         statements of
         demand
         assert more specific behavioral responsibilities within software engineering
         which are more closely related to the current state of the art. The range
         of statements is from the more general aspirational statement to specific
         measurable
         requirements.</p>
       <p>
         Although all levels of professional obligation are recognized, the
             Code is not intended to be all inclusive, nor 1S it intended that
             its individual parts
     be used in isolation to justify errors of omission or commission. The list
     of Principles and Clauses is not exhaustive, and should not be read as separating
     the acceptable from the unacceptab le in professional conduct in all practical
     situations. The Code is not a simple ethical algorithm which generates ethical
     decisions. In some situations standards may conflict with each other or with
     standards from other sources. These situation s require the software engineer
     to use ethical judgment to act in a manner which is most consistent with
             the spirit of the Code of Ethics, given the circumstances.</p>
       <p>These ethical tensions can best be addressed by thoughtful consideration
         of fundamental principles, rather than reliance on detailed regulations.
         These Principles should influence you to consider broadly who is affected
         by your work; to examine if you and your colleagues are treating other
         human beings with due respect; to speculate on how the public would view
         your decision if they were reasonably well informed; to analyze how the
         least empowered will be affected by your decision; and to consider whether
         your acts would be judged worthy of the ideal professional working as
         a software engineer. Since this code represents a consensus of those
         engaged in the profession, one should take into account what is likely
         to be judged as the most ethical way to act in the circumstances by informed,
         respected, and experienced peers in possession of all the facts and only
       depart from such a course for profound reasons, backed with careful judgment.</p>
       <p>The
           dynamic and demanding context of software engineering requires a code
           that is adaptable and relevant to new situations as they occur. However
           even in
     this generality, the Code provides support for the software engineer who
         needs to take positive action by documenting the ethical stance of the
         profession.
     It provides an ethical foundation to which individuals within teams and the
     team as a whole can appeal. The Code also helps to define those things which
     are ethically improper to request of a software engineer.</p>
       <p>The Code has an
           educational function, stating what is required of anyone wishing to
         join or continue in the software engineering community. Because
       it expresses
       the consensus of the profession on ethical issues, it can be used as a
         guide to decision making and as a means to educate both the public and
         aspiring
       professionals about the professional obligation of all software engineers.<br>
       </p>
       <p>PRINCIPLES<br>
   Principle 1: Product</p>
       <p><br>
   Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, ensure that the software on

       <p><br>
   Principle 2: Public<br>
   Software engineers shall, in their professional role, act only in ways consistent
   with the public safety, health, and welfare. In particular, software engineers
   shall:<br>
   2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential
   danger to the uses a third party, or the environment, that they reasonably
   believe to be associated with the software or related documents for which they
   are responsible, or merely know about.<br>
   2.02. Approve software only if they have a well founded belief that it is safe,
   meets specifications, has passed appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality

       <p><br>
   Principle 3: <br>
   JUDGEMENT<br>
   Software engineers shall, insofar as possible and consistent with Principle
   2, protect both the independence of their professional judgment and their reputation
   for such judgment. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:<br>
   3.01. Maintain professional objectivity with respect to any software or related
   documents they are asked to evaluate.<br>
   3.02. Affix their signature only to documents prepared under their supervision

   to support and maintain human values.</p>
       <p>Principle 4: CLIENT AND EMPLOYER</p>
       <p>Software engineers shall, consistent<br>
   with the public health, safe and welfare, always act in professional matters<br>
   as faithful agents and trustees of their client or employer. In particular,
   software<br>
   engineers shall:<br>
   4.01. Provide service only in areas of their competence.<br>
   4.02. Ensure that any document upon which they rely has been approved by someone
   authorized to approve it.<br>
   4.03. Use the property of a client or employer only in ways properly authorized,
   and with the client's or employer's knowledge and consent.<br>
   4.04. Not knowingly use illegally obtained or retained software.<br>

   or matters of social concern in the software or related documents on which
   they work or of which they are aware.<br>
   4.07. Inform the client or the employer promptly if, in their opinion, a project
   is likely to fail, to prove too expensive, to violate intellectual property
   legislation-in particular copyright, patent, and trade marks?or otherwise be
   problematic.<br>
   4.08. Accept no outside work detrimental to the work they perform for their
   primary employer.<br>
   4.09. Represent no interest adverse to their employer's without the employer's
   specific consent, unless a higher ethical concern is being compromised; then
   in that case the employer or another appropriate authority should be informed
   of the engineer's ethical concern.</p>
       <p>Principle 6: MANAGEMENT<br>
   A software engineer in a management or leadership capacity shall act fairly
     and shall enable and encourage those whom they lead to meet their own and
     collective obligations, including those under this code. In particular, those
     software engineers in leadership roles shall as appropriate:<br>
   5.01. Ensure that employees are informed of standards before being held to
