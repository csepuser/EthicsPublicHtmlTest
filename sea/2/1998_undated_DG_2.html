                   Final Ballot
 
                   <p>General comments:</p>
 
                   <p>1. Although a preferred title would simply be &#8220;Software 
 
                     Engineering Code of Professional Practice&#8221;, one could 
 
                     accept &#8220;Code of Ethics&#8221; for the short version 
 
                     and &#8220;Code of Professional Practice&#8221; for the full 
 
                     one. Both titles together are confusing.</p>
 
                   <p>2. Even if the drafters claim the code is not prescriptive 
 
                     -in the short version preamble, the levels of fine detail 
 
                     often make it appear so. The full version preamble will specify 
 
                     &#8220;the code prescribes these as obligations of anyone 
 
                     ...&#8221;! Does the IEEE have specific plans to lobby to 
 
                     see the code introduced as a means of discussion in educational 
 
                     curricula? And where? Please avoid technology imperialism 
 
                     and stress aspirations more than prescriptions and details.</p>
 
                   <p>3. A clearer hierarchy of concerns is now more evident than 
 
                     in previous drafts e.g., the public; client or employer, etc. 
 
                     This is useful. There are, however, still clear conflicts 
 
                     of interest that arise: the conflict between &#8220;Public&#8221; 
 
                     and &#8220;Client or Employer&#8221; is one of major concern. 
 
                     R- SEE YOUR COMMENT 5 RECOGNIZING THE PRIOIRTY OF CONCERN 
 
                     FOR PUBLIC </p>
 
                   <p>4. Nowhere is what is &#8220;ethics&#8221; or &#8220;an ethical 
 
                     approach&#8221; made clear. There is no reference to any underlying 
 
                     philosophies or theories of ethics. Hence, there is no really 
 
                     clear, delineated assistance for the individual/group in making 
 
                     &#8220;ethical decisions&#8221; about particular behaviors. 
 
                     Though &#8220;fundamental principles&#8221; are referred to 
 
                     in passing, the ordinary software engineer would have no idea 
 
                     of what these are as a result of reading the code.</p>
 
                   <p> R- FULL PREAMBLE, TREAT HUMAN BEINGS WITH DUE RESPECT, ACTS 
 
                     JUDGED WORTHY BY IDEAL PROFESSIONAL, KANT, Perhaps the drafters 
 
                     take an implicitly utilitarian approach? R- REQUIRES CONSIDERATION 
 
                     OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS &lt;- Rawls How to help in enforcing then 
 
                     item 8.08? See also comments on the Preamble of the full version 
 
                     and its vicious circle of self-foundation.</p>
 
                   <p>5. Both Preambles stress: &#8220;Making software engineering 
 
                     a beneficial and respected profession&#8221;: isn&#8217;t 
 
                     it a bit ethno-centric ... and contradictory to another assertion 
 
                     &#8220;the public interest is central to this code&#8221;? 
 
                      
 
                     R- No CONTRADICTION-WORKING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST MAKES SE 
 
                     RESPECTED</p>
 
                   <p>6. There is no indication of any method of enforcement or 
 
                     potential penalties to be made if the content is transgressed. 
 
                     See in 6.11-6.13, items lost among others, and which could 
 
                     constitute the basis for enforcement and complaint procedures. 
 
                     N- THERE IS NO ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO SIPPORT SANCTIONS, 
 
                     SANCTIONING METHODS ARE NOT GENERALLY CONTAINED IN THE CODE</p>
 
                   <p>Specific comments on the Short version: 
 
                     Item 5. Why the word &#8220;ethical&#8221; here and only here? 
 
                     Suggestion: &#8220;promote an approach to ... which is in 
 
                     accordance with this code&#8221;.</p>
 
                   <p> 
 
                     Specific comments on the Full version: 
 
                     Preamble:  
 
                     - &#8220;Growing role in ...&#8221;: Why to put &#8220;commerce&#8221; 
 
                     in first? 
 
                     N -IT IS THE FIRST ALPHABETICALLY</p>
 
                   <p>- Obligations founded in the software engineers&#8217; humanity? 
 
                     What does it mean? And later &#8220;The Code provides en ethical 
 
                     foundation ...&#8221; We are in a vicious circle of self-foundation? 
 
                     R- ONLY CIRCULAR IF PROVIDES MEANS THE CODE IS THE SOURCE 
 
                     OF THE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES..NO CIRULARITY BECAUSE &quot;PROVIDES&quot; 
 
                     MEANS THE CODE IDENTIFIES MORAL PRINCIPLES FROM WHICH THE 
 
                     CONTENT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.</p>
 
                   <p> - In general, the code appears overly illustrative, even 
 
                     down to rather fine details about very particular behaviors: 
 
                     no doubt, however, its drafters have distinct examples of 
 
                     particular personal or organizational behaviors in mind that 
 
                     they wish to see countered. But is it really needed to go 
 
                     so far? Will a too long code not be quickly forgotten? Wouldn&#8217;t 
 
                     be better to alleviate the full version and have a kind of 
 
                     accompanying comment more explicit on what you have in mind? 
 
                     N- RESPONDED TO BE ALSO HAVING A SHORT VERSION OF THE CODE 
 
                     - Many items, although probably interesting for the quality 
 
                     of the profession, are out of scope from an ethical point 
 
                     of view, like for instance 2.04, 3.05 to 3.11, 5.02 and ff., 
 
                     but also others.</p>
 
                   <p> It weakens the code. R- SEE RESPONSE TO -THIS IS A CODE 
 
                     OF ETHICS AND PRACTICE. IT IS THE PRACTICE WHICH UNIQUELY 
 
                     IDENTIFIES IT AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE. Principles and 
 
                     details: - 1.01 to 1.08: the sequence order is all but clear. 
 
                     1.07 for instance, although quite welcomed, looks like a lost 
 
                     item in the list! - 2.02 is badly formulated. How could you 
 
                     sign a code of ethics and, at the same time, retain something 
 
                     illegally or unethically? I was thinking reading more the 
 
                     Software Publishers Association&#8217;s Statement on Anti-piracy 
 
                     than a Code of professional responsibility! R- AD HOMINEN, 
 
                     THE SPA'S SUPPORT OF HONESTY DOES NOT MAKE HONESTY LESS VALUABLE</p>
 
                   <p>- 2.09: incomprehensible. 
 
                     - 3.03 is a hidden item in the list. In my view, it is not 
 
                     a &#8220;detail&#8221;, but the &#8220;principle&#8221;. 
 
                     - 3.04: Could specifically include on-the-job training which 
 
                     is particularly evident in the work of e.g., Japanese and 
 
                     British software engineers. 
 
                     - 4.04 is so obvious that the reason why it is here is not 
 
                     clear. Moreover, what is its specific relation to software 
 
                     engineering? It may also depend on cultures and countries! 
 
                     - Principle 5: see comment about &#8220;ethical&#8221; in 
 
                     the Comment on the short version. 
 
                     - 5.11 and 5.12 are most probably the cause of conflicts of 
 
                     interests. It would be better to put them at the beginning 
 
                     of the list, or even to put them in the principle, as suggested 
 
                     in my comment supra. 
 
                     - Certain clauses in this managerial section are highly contingent 
 
                     on specific organizational practices, responsibility for which 
 
                     may be outside the control of software engineers or their 
 
                     managers, e.g., human resource or personnel departments, salary 
 
                     sections, ... 
 
                     - 6.02: what is the meaning of such an assertion? 
 
                     - 6.06 is not clear. 
 
                     - 6.11 is spelled out in such terms that is something which 
 
                     is more &#8220;professional&#8221; than &#8220;ethical&#8221;! 
 
                     - 8.08 is a duplication of 6.11
