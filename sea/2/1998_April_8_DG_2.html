       <div align="justify">
         <p>8 April 1998 </p>
         <p>Dear Charles House and Dennis Frailey: </p>
       </div>
       <p align="justify">As chair of the IEEE-CS/ACM Joint Task Force on Software
         Engineering Ethics and Professional Practice (SEEPP), I respectfully
         request that the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional
         Practice (version 4) be considered at the next Executive Council meeting
         in May for adoption by the ACM. A similar request is being made to the
         President of the IEEE-CS for adoption by their board of governors at
         their June meeting.</p>
       <p align="justify">The SEEPP task force sent the Code and their letter
         of recommendation to the Joint Steering Committee in December and a follow
         up letter in January.(See attachments below). We understand the Steering
         Committee's response has been delayed, owing to a reorganization. This
         delay has several unfortunate consequences.</p>
       <p align="justify">The Code is the only finished product so far of the
         IEEE-CS/ACM's joint effort to professionalize software engineering. The
         computing community has criticized this joint effort as going nowhere.
         Not approving the Code only contributes to this unfortunate view of this
         important joint effort.</p>
       <p align="justify">At a recent software engineering meeting where the process
         of licensing software engineers in Texas was being discussed, the Software
         Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice was described as
         a significant contribution to professionalization and licensing of software
         engineers. It would be unfortunate if the Texas Board adopted this Code
         as their standard before it was approved by its sponsoring societies.</p>
       <p align="justify">The development of the Code was an international process
         and it has already received international recognition. This recognition
         includes the Code's adoption as a code of practice by industry such as
         Siemen's Software Development, India. It is being published in several
         computer ethics text books--including Kevin Bowyer's revision of his
         IEEE-CS book on Computer Ethics-- and the Code has been discussed at
         several professional meetings. It is also forthcoming in the Journal
         of Business Ethics, Journal of Science and Engineering Ethics, the Proceeding
         of the ACM Policy Conference in May and the SIGCSE Bulletin.</p>
       <p align="justify">As indicated in our original request to the Steering
         Committee, the Code has undergone extensive review by those who would
         be affected by its adoption. ACM and IEEE-CS members throughout the world
         have seen its publication in Computer and CACM. Comments have been solicited
         over several web sites, and from professional programmers by managers
         from industry. The Code has been reviewed by ethics officers of large
         industries, philosophers, and ethicists. The resulting document represents
         a general consensus of the moral obligations of individual software engineers
         and the profession.</p>
       <p align="justify">I hope you will agree that the ACM and the IEEE-CS will
         need to finish this project by approving this Code. Such approval is
         consistent with the original goals of the Joint Steering Committee and
         will help define and direct the profession. The absence of such approval
         indicates a lack of support for ethical practices. A continuing failure
         to endorse the Code will force each software practitioner to re-invent
         the morality of software engineering. </p>
       <p align="justify">The Code addresses both the responsibility of the practicing
         professional and of the profession. We believe that the societies representing
         the profession need to take a stand to provide all software engineers
         with an ethical direction and with a tool they can use to educate others
         -- including their management-- about the ethical responsibilities of
         the software engineer. The approval of this Code will clearly state the
         moral commitments of practicing professionals and of the profession.</p>
       <p align="justify">Please let us know what can do to forward this process.</p>
       <p align="justify">Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
       <p align="justify">Sincerely, The Executive Committee of the SEEPP Task
         Force</p>

       <p align="justify"> =============Original Letters below===========</p>
       <p align="justify">19 January 1998 Dear Steering Committee for the Professionalization
         of Software Engineering:</p>
       <p align="justify">A month ago I sent a recommendation from our task force
         for the approval of the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional
         Practice by the Steering Committee and its recommendation to the Board
         of Governors of the IEEE-CS and the Executive Committee of the ACM. I
         have not heard any response to this request. </p>
       <p align="justify">I believe the Board of Governors of the IEEE-CS and
         the Executive Committee of the ACM have meetings scheduled in February
         and I would be willing to represent the SEEPP task force at these meetings.
         It would be salubrious if the Code were approved at those meetings. There
         are already several events scheduled for February and March which include
         the Code. Articles about the Code ,for example, are forthcoming in CACM
         Risks Column, the SIGCAS Newsletter, and the Lockheed Martin newsletter.
         The Code will be used in a Master Class at Ethicomp'98 (Rotterdam), in
         a workshop at the Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training
         sponsored by the Computer Society and the Software Engineering Institute(Atlanta).
         The Code is also the subject of a paper at the ACM Policy Conference(Washington,
         DC) and a presentation to industrialist in Australia. These meetings
         related to the Code would also provide a venue for the leadership of
         the Societies to announce their support of this ethical standard and
         mark the achievements of the Joint Steering Committee. </p>
       <p align="justify">The purpose of the task force on Software Engineering
         Ethics and Professional Practices is to document the ethical and professional
         responsibilities and obligations of software engineers. The task Force
         developed a code for a sub-specialization within the constituencies of
         both organizations and the profession itself.</p>
       <p align="justify">But the Code is much more than that. The goal of the
         IEEE-CS/ACM Steering Committee was to Professionalize Software Engineering.
         Software engineering as a discipline has particular idiosyncratic needs,
         as described in the details of the Code. The success of this effort to
         articulate the professional responsibilities of software engineers has
         already been recognized. The Texas Board of Professional Engineer's Licensing
         Committee, in a recent meeting that addressed the subject of professional
         registration of software engineers, recognized software engineering as
         a new discipline. Specifically as a disciple with its own foundations
         and unique body of knowledge. They also expressed high regard for the
         Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice. Specificity
         of practice is the key to the elaborated Code.. </p>
       <p align="justify">The professionalization of software engineering requires
         a Code which is international and can be adopted by professional organizations,
         industry, and individual professionals. We have developed a Code that
         straddles the ACM/IEEE-CS gulf, and differs enough from both the ACM
         and IEEE's more general codes to attract attention from non-organizational
         types (like industries). From the evidence, we seem to have accomplished
         both of these goals. The Code has received support from numerous countries
         including Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Germany, India, Ireland,
         Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States, and Uruguay. This and other
         evidence from our survey indicates that the Code has international consensus.
         The Code also has received support from numerous industries, from large
         multi-nationals to small software development firms. </p>
       <p align="justify">The Code can function as an ethical charter for the
         profession. Its joint support by the ACM and the IEEE-CS is a good idea,
         it shows the public that different organizations within the same industry
         can cooperate, and makes it easier for professionals to understand what
         their obligations are. If there are any questions please feel free to
         contact me. I look forward to working with the Steering Committee to
         bring this task to a successful completion.</p>
       <p align="justify">Sincerely, Donald Gotterbarn for the SEEPP Task Force. </p>

       <p align="justify">===================Original Letter=======================
         December 16, 1997</p>
       <p align="justify">To the Joint IEEE-CS/ACM Steering Committee on the Professionalization
         of Software Engineering and Executive Committees of the ACM and the IEEE-CS:</p>
       <p align="justify">The Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
         Practices has completed its work in developing a Software Engineering
         Code of Ethics and Professional Practice and recommends its approval
         by both professional societies. We recommend this action for the following
         reasons: Support by both societies will be a public assertion by the
         profession of a unified commitment to ethical responsibility, The Code
         represents an international standard of practice, The Code has been reviewed
         and adopted by industry, The Code presents a broad consensus of the profession,
         and There is wide demonstrated positive support, including from Academia,
         for the Code.</p>
       <p align="justify">This Code complements the more general codes of ethics
         of both societies which address the issues of the computing profession
         as a whole. The Code of Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
         Practice addresses the ethical issues and standards of conduct which
         specifically arise within the practice of software engineering. In this
         sense the code is not a replacement for any existing code.</p>
       <p align="justify">The approval of this Code by both societies will be
         a significant forward step for the software engineering profession. The
         cooperative support given by both societies to the development and approval
         of this Code underscores the importance of a commitment to ethical practices
         by the profession and will serve as a model for other developing professions. </p>
       <p align="justify">The development of this Code was unique in its international
         flavor. The task force and the executive committee had international
         representation, including from Europe, Africa, Australia, and North America.
         As the process of development and revision proceeded, this network of
         international participation and comment spread throughout the world.
         In an effort to be consistent with the codes of the major computing professional
         societies throughout the world, the task force solicited responses from
         members of the major computing societies. Comment and support was also
         received from the International Federation of Information Processing
         (IFIP). The task force also included two lawyers specializing in computer
         law, and one representative from the military.</p>
       <p align="justify">The Code has been positively reviewed by several ethics
         officers and ethics directors of multinational organizations after sharing
         it with software engineers in their organizations. Such industries included:
         Lockheed Martin, Northrup Gruman, and Digital Equipment. We also heard
         from CEO's of smaller companies indicating strong support for the Code.
         In fact, the Code has already, in its preliminary form, been adapted
         by St.Paul Companies as their information systems code of ethics with
         only minor modifications, such as, replacing the expression &quot;software
         engineer&quot; with &quot;IS professional&quot;.</p>
       <p align="justify">The Code was developed using a process of continuous
         review and revision. The final draft of the Code, together with a questionnaire,
         was published on several web sites, in some ACM SIG journals and in Computer
         and CACM. The results of the survey were that most items had greater
         than 95 percent support with many at 100 percent. The highest level of
         opposition to any clause was 12%. In the light of feedback, the Principles
         and associated Clauses have been reviewed and modified where necessary.
         We are confident that if the survey were to be taken again, all Clauses
         would receive an approval rating of over 95% The Code has also received
         a positive response from academe. We have received several requests to
         have the Code included in computer ethics and software engineering textbooks
         and have been asked to develop case studies for software engineering
         classes based on the Code.</p>
       <p align="justify">The Code has already proven to be a dynamic and useful
         document becoming a model within at least one industry. Both societies
         have already recognized that education about their codes of ethics is
         an important issue. Several members of the SEEPP task force are on the
         IEEE-CS and the ACM committees which are responsible for the maintenance
         of their codes and education of the membership about their codes of ethics.
         To support the maintenance of and education about the Code, we plan to
         maintain it initially on the Software Engineering Ethics Research Institute's
         and Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility's web sites. The SEEPP
         Task Force will continue to gather input from the community about the
         Code and develop and share examples of using the Code. Industry has already
         donated case studies related to the Clauses of the Code. It would be
         beneficial to the profession if both societies endorsed this effort and
         approved the Code.</p>
