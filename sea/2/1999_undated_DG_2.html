      <p>Code Reuse: a response Response
         to Parnas in SEN <br>
   Don Gotterbarn, Keith Miller, Simon Rogerson<br>
   .<br>
   We were a little surprised by the response of a highly respected software
   engineer, David Parnas, to the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional
   Practice.
   In his comments he raises some very important issues for the professionalization
   of software engineering. We could not agree with him more that there is a
   need to define the core skills of software engineers. But we are concerned
   that his
   interest in this has led him to underestimate the role of a Code of Ethics
   in a profession. His letter to the editor contains two sets of issues; criticisms
   of the Code per se and the claim that any code is irrelevant- &#8220;a distraction&#8221;-
   to the real issues of software engineering. </p>
      <p>THE CODE<br>
   He criticizes the Code as both vague and unnecessary. To include a detailed
     level of software engineering standards, such as requiring mutation testing
     for all mission critical software, in a code would be a mistake. Specific
     software engineering standards which have been proposed are controversial
     and in constant flux.<br>
                       <br>
   The Code, as written does encourage us to exploit standards ??but it cannot
   name them. When the profession settles these issues, then we can incorporate
   them into a code. Codes have different purposes, among them guidance, inspiration
   and education. The code can help lead us to serious discussions about the details
   of standards; the code cannot prematurely set those standards.</p>
                   <p>He justifies the &#8220;vagueness&#8221; criticism in by
                     various uses of the term&#8220;motherhood&#8221;</p>
                   <p>Motherhood-1. He claims that the Code contains statements
                     that &#8220;no one would disagree with&#8221;. <br>
   Having led the development and final approval of the Code, we have a less optimistic
   view of the intuitively obvious nature ethical standards of software engineering.
   For most of the world software engineering is, at best, an emerging profession
   with conflicting views about the professional standards. The Code&#8217;s review
   process, described in the original article (SEN January 1999), gives clear
   empirical evidence of this diversity. In 149 pages of comments developed during
   the IEEE-CS formal review, the following conflicting comments were made by
   practicing &#8220;professional&#8221; software developers: add the clause &#8220;avoid
   criticism of software engineers&#8221;, remove 1.08 ...volunteer professional
   skills to good causes&#8217;,... make 1.08 mandatory, remove references to
   maintenance, include all forms of maintenance, &#8220;...not all jobs require
   the highest professional standards&#8221;, a plethora of opinions on the ethics
   of using bootlegged software, delete &#8220;consistent with the public interest&#8221;, &#8220;...there
   is no specific reference to Y2K in the Code&#8221;, &#8220;...remove the clause
   on testing. Testing is the clients responsibility.&#8221; Comments like these
   are empirical evidence against his optimistic assertion that &#8220;no one
   can disagree with&#8221; any line of the code. </p>
                   <p>He claims that <br>
                       <br>
 &#8220;... statements were made universally acceptable by the use of words like &quot;adequate&quot;...
 I am told that I must do adequate testing but never told how much testing is
 adequate or how to tell if I have done enough testing. How would I know whether
 or not I am violating the code?&#8221; <br>
   The answer is that if one does not have professional judgment sufficient to
   answer this question then he/she is violating the Code just by working on the
   project. Parnas&#8217; ad hominem is not justified. He knows that there are
   different techniques used for different systems and the word &#8220;adequate&#8221; is
   used to accurately reflect the breadth of software engineering. Reading the
   whole Code will provide a variety of ways to make the adequacy judgement, including
   talking with other competent software engineers who are familiar with the development
   domain. These methods will work today and they will work when new testing standards
   have been developed. </p>
                   <p>Motherhood-2. Even if we were to agree that the Code&#8217;s
                     statements are mostly descriptions of important generally
                     accepted ethical principles learned from our parents, it
                     does not indicate that these statements should not be removed
                     from the Code. Being reminded of these &#8220;ethical principles&#8221; is
                     considered important to many religions and nations. We have
                     applauded software engineers who have publicly asserted such &#8220;motherhood&#8221; principles
                     as &#8220;One&#8217;s obligations as a professional precede
                     other obligations. One must not enter into contracts which
                     conflict with one&#8217;s professional obligations.&#8221; (David
                     Parnas, &#8220; Professional Responsibility to Blow the Whistle
                     on SDI.&#8221;) This public commitment to an ethical principle
                     was an important declaration, even though someone may have
                     called it &#8220;motherhood&#8221;. The removal of that statement
                     would have significantly weakened the ethical significance
                     of his letter.</p>
                   <p>These principles need repeating to inspire us to stand-up
                     for our ethical responsibilities, to remind us of our ethical
                     obligations, to help educate students and society about what
                     can and should be expected of software engineers.</p>
                   <p>Motherhood-3. We have been challenged to show anything new
                     or controversial in the Code. Unlike most engineering codes,
                     the Preamble of the Code provides a method to make decisions
                     when two of its imperatives such as &#8220;Honor Contracts&#8221; and &#8220;Work
                     for the Enhancement of Human Welfare&#8221; are in conflict.
                     The Code advocates pro-bono work. The Code requires whistle
                     blowing and 6.12, 6.13 suggests a procedure to follow in
                     whistle blowing. This Code advocates a stakeholder analysis
                     which goes beyond the limited concerns of safety schedule
                     and budget. The National Society of Professional Engineers&#8217; Code
                     requires that an engineer report to a client, &#8220; if
                     in the engineer&#8217;s judgment, a project is likely to
                     fail&#8221;, whereas this Code requires that a software engineer
                     report &#8220;...if in their judgment a project is likely
                     to fail, to prove too expensive, to violate intellectual
                     property law, or otherwise be problematic.&#8221;. This code
                     addresses &#8220;...maintenance with the same professionalism
                     as new development.&#8221; This is a partial list of some
                     of the new and controversial elements in the Software Engineering
                     Code. </p>
                   <p> <br>
   It is difficult to respond to his charge that the Code is unnecessary. He first
     claims that the Code is vague and adds nothing to the vague platitudes of
     other codes, but he next asserts that these other codes are all we need;
     and we should REUSE these other vague -- platitude- ridden-- codes?</p>
                   <p>This code does not fit &#8220;under the vague platitudes
                     of other codes&#8221;; it includes details that other codes
                     don't, some specific to software engineering, others recast
                     in the software engineering realm. <br>
                       <br>
   In the 1980's Parnas needed to educate and argue that testing needed to be
   done on a safety critical system, to argue that is was ethical to blow the
   whistle on this development. The motherhood of this Code now requires whistle
   blowing for a defective system. The weight of all the software engineers who
   reviewed the Code and the support of the professional societies that approved
   it make it easier to defend these kinds of actions as consistent with the moral
   standard of software engineers. A Code that has been reviewed , voted on, an
   adopted by professional societies provides ethical direction for new software
   engineers and gives support to the ethical decision of other software engineers.</p>
                   <p>A DISTRACTION</p>
                   <p>We are more concerned with the second criticism-- the Code
                     of Ethics is just a distraction from the real issues of software
                     engineering-- than with his claims about the details of the
                     Code. He asserts that &#8220;ethical codes are just a distraction
                     from the real problem&#8221;... &#8220;identifying what engineers
                     call the &#8220;core body of knowledge&#8221; the knowledge
                     that should be posed by all software engineers.&#8221;</p>
                   <p>This kind of emphasis is a terrible mistake. We heartily
                     agree with the need for identifying a core body of knowledge.
                     The code does NOT distract from this search for identity,
                     it encourages us to search harder. Parnas thinks of the code
                     and the search as competing for attention. We think of the
                     code and the search as two complementary activities by people
                     who care about the profession.</p>
                   <p>The IEEE-CS/ACM have been working on addressing the body
                     of knowledge question. They have recently formed the Software
                     Engineering Coordinating Committee to continue the work which
                     supported the development of the Software Engineering Code
                     of Ethics. Their plan calls for the Code of Ethics to inform
                     both the body of knowledge and the curriculum design.</p>
                   <p> <br>
   They understand that ethics and values are relevant to what we will define
     as our core body of knowledge. Without a broad concern for stakeholders in
     the software product and software development it would be reasonable to train
     and expect software developers to develop the shoddiest most harmful products
     possible. If the Code is not related to the body of knowledge then a &#8220;good&#8221; software
     engineer is someone who develops junk effectively.</p>
                   <p>Parnas realized this in his &#8220;Professional Responsibility
                     to Blow the Whistle on SDI&#8221;. When arguing for the technical
                     problems with SDI with his fellow scientist, he &#8220;found
                     none that disagreed with my technical conclusion.&#8221; Having
                     the technical skill was not sufficient. Parnas brought ethical
                     judgement to the technical task; ethical judgement needed
                     to correctly respond to the technical task.</p>
                   <p>In addition to a body of knowledge, one element that separates
                     professionals (in the philosophical sense) is that they pledge
                     themselves to certain moral responsibilities and a higher
                     order of care. The code leads to that kind of pledge. Is
                     that sufficient to establish the profession? Of course not.
                     Is it a necessary step? We think so. The body of knowledge
                     is incomplete without values.</p>
                   <p>The code is not meaningless and it is not worthless. It
                     is not perfect nor is it a panacea. But the fact that it
                     has given David Parnas an opportunity to press for better
                     standards in software engineering illustrates that the code
                     can lead to more awareness of where we must go to improve.
                     Don't fight the code, use the code in the good fight for
                     improved professional standards in software engineering.
                     The code is not a distraction, but trivializing the code
                     is a distraction. </p>
