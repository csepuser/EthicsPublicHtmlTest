   Advisory Panel Report An Assessment of Software Engineering Body of Knowledge
     Efforts<br>
   ACM Task Force on Licensing of Software Engineers Working on Safety-Critical
   Software</p>
 <p>Executive Summary</p>
 <p>ACM has been working with the IEEE Computer Society for several years on projects
   to examine and guide the evolution of software engineering as a profession.
   In recent years, the efforts of the joint Software Engineering Coordinating
   Committee (SWECC) have increasingly been perceived as furthering efforts to
   license software engineers. Two particular efforts stand out: 1) communications
   with the State of Texas relative to Texas' desire to develop a licensing exam
   for software engineers under the general framework for professional engineers
   (PE's); and 2) the development of a first-draft of a statement of the body
   of knowledge (SWEBOK) that all software engineers would be expected to know.</p>
 <p>Concern over the direction that SWECC was moving prompted ACM to establish
   task forces to further investigate the issue of software engineering and the
   need for licensing. Following a study by a blue ribbon panel of prominent software
   engineers, the ACM Council decided in May 1999 that it could not support licensing
   of software engineers. ACM's position is that</p>
 <p> <br>
   Our state of knowledge and practice in software engineering is too immature
     to warrant licensing. Moreover, Council felt licensing would be ineffective
     in providing assurances about software quality and reliability.</p>
 <p>At its meeting in May 2000, the Council further concluded that the framework
   of a licensed professional engineer, originally developed for civil engineers,
   does not match the professional industrial practice of software engineering.
   Such licensing practices would give false assurances of competence even if
   the body of knowledge were mature; and would preclude many of the most qualified
   software engineers from becoming licensed.</p>
 <p>Because SWECC has become so closely identified with licensing of software
   engineers under a professional engineer model, the ACM Council decided to withdraw
   from SWECC.</p>
 <p>Although ACM has withdrawn from SWECC, ACM believes the problem of reliable
   and dependable software, especially in critical applications, is the most important
   problem facing the IT profession. ACM will continue to work closely with IEEE
   Computer Society on projects that further the evolution of software engineering
   as a professional computing discipline and improve the quality of software
   and the capabilities of software engineers.</p>
 <p>The Issue</p>
 <p>For many years ACM has been involved in joint efforts with the IEEE Computer
   Society to examine ways to improve our ability to engineer software systems
   effectively. Most of the recent joint efforts have been directed toward creating
   a body of knowledge expected of competent software engineers. This body of
   knowledge also would likely provide the basis for an exam for licensing software
   engineers as professional engineers.</p>
 <p>In the U.S., mandatory licensing has been used as a means to protect the public
   from malpractice by those offering services directly to the public, such as
   doctors, lawyers, civil engineers, contractors, day care workers, barbers,
   and surveyors. Many licensing advocates argue it would help promote software
   engineering into a profession and would safeguard society against incompetent
   engineers. Those against licensing argue it would not be practical-nor effective-in
   achieving these goals. Indeed, they say no recognized, generally accepted body
   of knowledge exists on which licensing examinations could be based.</p>
 <p>Because of the importance and potential impact of this issue on ACM's constituency,
   ACM Council has been gathering information to help</p>
 <p> <br>
   determine whether the association Should he supporting efforts W closely linked
     with licensing. This report examines what we have learned and explains why
     the ACM Council has voted to withdraw from current joint ACM/IEEE-CS efforts
     that are being used to promote licensing of software engineers as Professional
     Engineers (PE)s It includes efforts to establish a body of knowledge that
     could be used as a basis for PE licensing examinations in software engineering.</p>
 <p>Background</p>
 <p>The Joint IEEE-CS and ACM Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software
   Engineering as a Profession was created in 1993. This committee was superseded
   in late 1998 by the Software Engineering Coordinating Committee (SWECC) which
   was established to act as a &quot;permanent entity to foster the evolution
   of software engineering as a professional computing discipline.&quot;</p>
 <p>SWECC, with the approval of the both societies, sets up projects in the general
   area of software engineering. It should be noted, however, that the SWECC Charter
   makes no mention of licensing. In fact, the ACM Council approved the Charter
   only because it appeared any effort to support licensing would be a small part
   of the SWECC efforts and would be done only in response to requests for professional
   advice and evaluation from licensing bodies. A key project of SWECC has been
   a software engineering body of knowledge-or SWEBOK-project, an outgrowth of
   a project begun by the Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering
   as a Profession.</p>
 <p>During the time SWECC was established, the ACM and IEEE-CS received a request
   by the Texas Professional Engineers Licensing Board for help in defining performance
   criteria for software engineering licensing exams to be administered in Texas.
   At the time, ACM agreed to establish the SWEBOK project under SWECC. One of
   the intended uses of the body of knowledge resulting from the project was as
   a source of information in response to the request from the Texas Board and
   other licensing agencies. This agreement was reached despite the fact some
   members of the ACM Council had strong reservations about whether licensing
   software engineers was in the best interests of the field of computing and
   the public.</p>
 <p>In early 1999, ACM officers and Council members became concerned about the
   growing perception that the primary purpose of SWECC and its SWEBOK project
   was to support the licensing efforts of software engineers as PEs. To gather
   more information about the issue, ACM named an Advisory Panel on Professional
   Licensing in Software Engineering in March 1999 to make recommendations to
   the ACM Council about the role it should take with regard to licensing issues.
   The committee was headed by</p>
 <p> <br>
   Fran Allen and Paula Hawthorn and included as members Barry Boehm, Fred Brooks,
     Jim Browne, Dave Farber, Sue Graham, Jim Gray, Ken Kennedy, Nancy Leveson,
     Dave Nagel, Peter Neumann, Dave Parnas, and Bill Wulf. Although the panel
     could not reach consensus about licensing, the majority recommended against
     it and against supporting the Texas effort. (The final report of the Advisory
     Panel is included as an appendix to this report.)</p>
 <p>After reviewing and discussing the advisory panel's report, the ACM Council
   passed the following motion in May 1999:</p>
 <p>ACM is opposed to the licensing of software engineers at this time because
   ACM believes it is premature and would not be effective at addressing the problems
   of software quality and reliability.</p>
 <p>ACM is, however, committed to solving the software quality problem by promoting
   R&amp;D, by developing a core body of knowledge for software engineering, and
   by identifying standards of practice.</p>
 <p>At that time, ACM decided to remain a member of SWECC. To determine how much
   support ACM should be providing to SWECC activities, ACM President Barbara
   Simons created two Blue Ribbon task forces in the summer of 1999. One task
   force would evaluate SWEBOK activities, the other would determine ways in which
   ACM and the profession might improve the robustness and quality of safety-critical
   software and evaluate the SWECC licensing activities in this context. (The
   report from the SWEBOK evaluation committee is included in the appendix. A
   preliminary report from the Safety-Critical Software committee covering the
   licensing and body of knowledge efforts is also included. Please noted this
   committee is still examining other ways commonly used to protect the public,
   including the use of standards and codes of practice, legal liability, codes
   of ethics, insurance and voluntary product certification, warranties, government
   regulation and oversight, definition of a standard curriculum, accreditation
   of educational programs, and independent inspection of safety-critical products.
   Their final report, detailing the findings and recommendations with respect
   to all of these possible safeguarding approaches, should be available by the
   end of the summer.)</p>
 <p>ACM Position on Licensing of Software Engineers</p>
 <p>After reviewing the two Blue Ribbon task force reports-in light of the growing
   perception that SWECC's primary efforts are in support of the licensing of
   software engineers as PEs-the ACM Council was convinced it was not appropriate
   for the association to continue as a member of SWECC. However, the Council
   also reaffirmed its support for some SWECC projects, such as the curriculum
   project and the ethics project, and</p>
 <p> <br>
   also reaffirmed its interest in cooperating with the IEEE-CS in efforts to
     foster the evolution of software engineering in order to improve the quality
     of software systems. The Council requested the ACM Executive Committee explore
     alternatives to SWECC for continuing these efforts, and then voted to withdraw
     from SWECC.</p>
 <p>The motion passed by the ACM Council on June 30, 2000 states:</p>
 <p>Society is becoming increasingly dependent on computers and software, which
   creates tremendous challenges and responsibilities for computing professionals.
   ACM Council believes that confronting these challenges will require creative
   and collaborative efforts by industry, universities, professional societies,
   and government. ACM Council strongly supports the idea of the ACM and the IEEE
   Computing Society working together on these challenges, including joint initiatives
   to promote the emergence of information technology professions.</p>
 <p>However, ACM Council believes that the current efforts of the Software Engineering
   Coordinating Committee (SWECC) toward licensing is misguided as they assume
   that software engineering is a profession appropriate for licensing under the
   rubric of the Professional Engineers Licensing structure and requirements.
   Moreover, ACM Council feels that further efforts in this direction will detract
   from our ability to take other more practical and productive initiatives needed
   to meet our common goals.</p>
 <p>Accordingly, Council directs that ACM withdraw from SWECC. Council further
   directs the Executive Committee to implement the decision to withdraw as quickly
   as possible.</p>
 <p>To help ACM members understand the rationale behind this decision, we present
   the relevant findings and conclusions of the two task forces and then provide
   some questions and answers about the decision.</p>
 <p>The Task Force on Licensing of Software Engineers Working on Safety-Critical
   Software, chaired by Nancy Leveson and John Knight concluded that:</p>
 <p>Licensing as Professional Engineers would be impractical for software engineers,
   because it would require examinations over subjects most software engineers
   neither study in their formal education nor need in order to practice competent
   software engineering. Licensing software engineers as Professional Engineers
   would have no or little effect on the safety of the software produced.</p>
 <p> <br>
   The SWEBOK effort, which specifically excludes from the body of knowledge the
     special knowledge required for most safety-critical systems (such as real-time
     software engineering techniques), will have little relevance for safety-critical
     systems, and it dangerously excludes the most important knowledge required
     to build these systems. Each industry and software engineering domain will
     need to determine an appropriate mix of approaches that work together to
     solve their particular problems and fit within the cultural context of the
     particular industry. There are no simple and universal fixes to solve the
     problem of ensuring public safety. Effective approaches will involve establishing
     accountability, competency within specific application domains and job responsibilities,
     liability, regulation where appropriate, standards, voluntary product certification
     and warranties, and industry-specific requirements. Licensing as Professional
     Engineers would not be an effective way to accomplish any of these goals.</p>
 <p>The task force recommended that:</p>
 <p>ACM withdraw from efforts to license software engineers as Professional Engineers.
   ACM take a stand against government efforts to require the licensing of software
   engineers as impractical, ineffective with respect to protecting public safety,
   and potentially detrimental with respect to economic and other societal and
   technological factors. ACM not support the SWEBOK activities, but consider
   supporting other efforts to validate and codify basic knowledge in various
   aspects of software engineering. ACM investigate and support a broad range
   of approaches to solving any software quality issues that might exist.</p>
 <p>The Task Force on Assessment of the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge
   Efforts, chaired by David Notkin, concluded that:</p>
 <p>The selection process for including knowledge areas-which focuses on tables
   of contents of general software engineering textbooks and university curricula-is
   flawed and fails to recognize the gap between actual practice and what appears
   in textbooks. The SWEBOK effort-which uses &quot;generally accepted knowledge&quot; as
   the cornerstone for inclusion and specifically excludes &quot;practices used
   only for specific types of software&quot;-is highly likely to fail. The opposite
   approach-which focuses primarily focusing on specific domains-is far more likely
   to succeed. SWEBOK does not distinguish among possible roles within a software
   development project. A process for updating the SWEBOK results based on the
   actual</p>
 <p> <br>
   SWEBOK development efforts would be unlikely to succeed.</p>
 <p>The task force recommended that:</p>
 <p>The professional societies, including ACM, must pursue every possible means
   towards improving the current state of affairs. At the same time, they must
   refrain from pursuing activities like SWEBOK that have a significant chance
   of reducing the public's understanding of, confidence in, and assurances about
   key properties of software.</p>
 <p>In the Appendix to this summary is a set of Questions and Answers to further
   explain, and expand on, the ACM position. The final version of this summary
   will include the reports of the Blue Ribbon Panel, the Body of Knowledge Task
   Force, and the Safety Critical Software Task Force.</p>
 <p>Appendices</p>
 <p>A.Q&amp;A</p>
 <p>Why is ACM withdrawing from SWECC-</p>
 <p>The activities of SWECC have become associated with promoting the licensing
   of software engineers as Professional Engineers (PEs). Although many of the
   SWECC activities are still supported by ACM, such as the curriculum and ethics
   projects, having these projects remain under SWECC is not acceptable because
   by association they too are becoming viewed as support of the PE licensing
   mechanism for software engineers.</p>
 <p>One of the central purposes of licensing is to provide assurances to the public
   that a licensed person is competent at their professional duties. In the case
   of software engineering, a license would be interpreted as an authoritative
   statement that the licensed engineer would be capable of producing software
   systems of consistent reliability, dependability, and usability. The ACM Council
   concluded that our state of knowledge and practice is too immature to give
   such assurances</p>
 <p>Finally, the PE licensing mechanism is inappropriate for software engineering
   because its exam structure would preclude many of the most qualified software
   engineers from becoming licensed. ACM is opposed to any process that could
   prevent highly qualified software engineers, including many ACM members, from
   professional practice for which they are qualified..</p>
 <p>Is ACM against licensing software engineers-</p>
 <p> <br>
   discipline. We hope that through ITPI, the SIGs, and other joint activities
     we can work together toward this important goal.</p>

   D.<br>
   ACM Task Force on Licensing of Software Engineers Working on Safety-Critical
   Software<br>
   Yes. ACM is opposed to the licensing of software engineers because ACM believes
   that licensing would not be effective at providing assurances that software
   engineers could produce reliable, dependable, and usable software systems.
   When the body of knowledge matures and we have proven experience in certifying
   software engineering skills, ACM may reconsider its position.</p>
 <p>Is ACM against software engineering being viewed as a profession-</p>
 <p>No. ACM has a deep commitment to the professional ization of all parts of
   the IT field, not just software engineering. A field does not need licensing
   to be a profession.</p>
 <p>In May 1999, the ACM Council launched a major initiative-the Information Technology
   Profession Initiative (ITPI)- to foster the emerging IT profession. The ACM
   appointed Past-President Peter Denning to chair the ITPI steering committee
   and direct the initiative.</p>
 <p>Does ACM see a difference between licensing and certification-</p>
 <p>Yes. Certification is a statement by a recognized authority that a person
   is competent in an area. Licensing is permission of a jurisdiction for someone
   to practice his/her profession in that locality. Often licensing relies on
   prior certification by professional societies. But a certificate is not a license
   and a license does not imply competence without appropriate certifications.</p>
 <p>Under the ITPI, the ACM is exploring ways to offer professional certification
   to its members. Such a program is a long way from implementation. The ITPI
   steering committee believes if ACM, working cooperative with IEEE-CS and other
   groups, can establish a good certification program, that alone will be a major
   benefit to the profession.</p>
 <p>Will ACM continue its efforts to improve the quality of software-</p>
 <p>Absolutely. ACM believes the problem of reliable and dependable software,
   especially in critical applications, is the most important problem facing the
   IT profession. ACM Council is committed to improving the quality of software
   and the capabilities of software engineers through better education and promulgation
   of effective design strategies.</p>
 <p>ACM is interested in working closely with IEEE-CS in fostering the evolution
   of software engineering as a professional computing<br>
