   Call For Participation
       <p>
   Software Engineering Ethical and Professional Standards</p>
       <p>
   <strong>JOINT IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY / ACM PROJECT WORKING GROUPS FORMING</strong><br>
   The IEEE Computer Society and the ACM, then world's two largest organizations
   of computing professionals, with a combined membership of more than one hundred
   and seventy-five thousand members (worldwide) have established a Joint Steering
   Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering as a Profession. This
   steering committee has established three tasks forces to accomplish their
   mission. One task force is identifying the body of knowledge and recommended
   practices. and another task force is addressing educational issues. Our task
   force on
   Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices (SEEPP) is
   tasked with documenting and codifying standards of ethical and professional
   practices for Software Engineers. We invite your participation in this task.
   You do NOT need to be a member of either society in order to participate.</p>
       <p>
         <strong>1.0 SCOPE</strong></p>
       <p> These standards shall document generally accepted principles for identifying
         and resolving ethical conflicts relevant to the discipline of software
         engineering. Consideration shall be given to the responsibilities and
         obligations of the Software Engineer to peers and laypersons. employer.
         customer(s), the profession
   and society/humanity. Additionally, consideration shall be similarly given
         to the obligations and responsibilities of these various entities towards
         the Software
   Engineer.</p>
       <p>
         <strong>1.1 GLOBAL. APPLICATION</strong></p>
       <p>
   The SEEPP task force recognizes that the design, development and application
     of software often transcend national boundaries. We feel that it is vitally
     important
   that the global computing community have the means to insure that this project
     produces a product which is as reflective of the global computing community's
     wisdom
     as can be reasonably achieved. The participation of individuals from
   throughout the world is important to achieving this goal. These standards are
   intended to document the consensus of the global software engineering community.
   From time to time, consensus on an issue may not be clearly recognized. Accordingly,
     these standards shall also document various recommended practices and guidelines
     when no clear consensus can be established.</p>
       <p>
         <strong>2.0 PURPOSE</strong></p>
       <p> The purpose of the SEEPP task force is to document the international
         consensus for minimally acceptable ethical/professional responsibilities
         and obligations of Software Engineers.</p>
       <p>
         <strong>3.0 ORGANIZATION</strong></p>
       <p> Working groups are being formed to address specific areas of concern.
         Eight different subject areas are distinguished so far, as described
         below. Should additional subject areas be identified, additional working
         groups may be established. Working groups and illustrative issues/topics:<br>

         law, foster understanding
   by sharing values and ideals. what issues and norms are important for SE, how
   to carry out ethical activity (foundational basis of laws and treaties, why
   obey<br>
   laws). (Chair: Suzanne Weisband sweisband@bpa.arizona.edu Vice Chair: Steven

       <p><strong>3.2 &quot;OFFICIAL&quot; IEEE STANDARD</strong></p>
       <p>
   Working groups will operate according to the prams specified for IEEE. Standards
     (see Governance, below). However, working groups will NOT be initially chartered
     by the IEEE Computer Society's Standards Activities Board. (If the working
     groups were so chattered. individuals in several countries would be required
     to receive their government's approval for participation.)</p>
       <p>
         <strong>3.3 GOVERNANCE</strong></p>
       <p>
   The conduct of each working group shall follow the same written procedures
     that govern internationally recognized IEEE Standards Activities. These procedures
     specify that prompt consideration should be given to the written views and
     objections of all participants. Objectors should be notified of the disposition
     of an objection and the reasons therefor. Unresolved objections and the associated
     reasons should be reported to the entire working group's membership. The
     conclusions of the group should be supported by a consensus of the membership.
     (This would imply a ballot on the final products, probably run as IEEE Draft
     Standards ballots are currently run.).Computers and Society Page 37 December
   1994</p>

         <strong>3.4 E-MAIL &amp; MEETINGS</strong></p>
       <p> The Application Form is on the neat page. Working group business is
         expected to be primarily ' conducted via e-mail and computer mediated
         conferencing. From time to time. a working group may also conduct face
         to face or teleconference meetings. These meetings should be conducted
         in a manner which facilitates attendance by as many . members as possible.</p>
       <p>
         <strong>4.0 INTERNET ACCESS</strong></p>
       <p>
   Each working group member should have a valid Internet e-mail account. The
     member should also be prepared to obtain access to other Internet applications
     such as FIT, TELNET, Gopher, WAIS WWW/MOSAIC, etc.</p>
       <p>
         <strong>5.0 COMPLETION</strong></p>
