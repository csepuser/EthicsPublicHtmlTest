     - ELSEVIER - the Netherland publishing conglomerate<br>
     I thought we wanted a book leaning toward the application of Ethics but this
     is all open to change.<br>
     I agree we need to have the title and scope.<br>
     PROPOSAL: TITLE:ETHICS-Practical Applications<br>
     SCOPE: Review of Ethical principles with practical applications.This is just
     a proposal and I would like to hear your thoughts, the third editors thoughts,
     and publishers concerns on selling it.<br>
     In passing, it would be nice if the third editor was on the SEEPP like us but
     may not be geographically possible.</p>

   I agree, approach the European Publishers and third editor. I didn't mean to
   imply otherwise in my last e-mail.<br>
   The whole world is changing and what surprises me is two things<br>
   a) it doesn't seem to be changing toward the better and<br>
   b) the people associated with computers fight it the most considering that
   field has been changing at light speed.<br>

   Could we agree that I should approach the European Publishers I mentioned earlier,
   and having drawn up a third editor name list, start approaching the individuals
   from the top of the list.<br>
   I am not happy with Al's lukewarm response and would like to mention this when
   I see Barry Johnson ( the IEEE CS President-elect - as Mario's term is coming
   to an end soon) .<br>
   I joined IEEE CS during my student days and have experienced over these years
   the decline of its values. Al's response is one example.<br>

   New e-mail has me on the net any time my PC is on; much faster response times.<br>
                       <br>
   Hope you didn't lose too much in accreditation.<br>
   <br>
   I am not sure if Al Davis shot us down or just wanted to ignore the whole proposal.
   I think the editorial philosophy is changing; did you see Mario's letter. If
   you think we should try another mag, OK. It would be nice to see an article
   on ethics in an European Mag.<br>
                       <br>
   I think we should concentrate on the book. Go ahead with finding the publisher
   and Far East Author. I wasn't sure if you had the last outline so I attached
   it at the bottom of this e-mail. I agree we should edit; there are at least
   two text books. Maybe we should focus on a handbook(how to).<br>

   I am sorry for my long silence. The accreditation process took a life of its
   own and the saga continued and lasted for many weeks. It has come to an end-
   we lost some and gained some. Now it is out of the way, I would concentrate
   on the book. The last time we were in serious discussion, we were thinking
   of approaching a book publisher, I think. Could I therefore approach for example
   the following:</p>
       <p><br>
   - ARTECH HOUSE - a London Publisher<br>
   - ELSEVIER - the Netherland publishing conglomorate.If I remember correctly,
   you e-mailed me a list of topics.<br>
   We also need a Far East Author ( X-) Japanese, Australian, Newzealand ..).<br>
   Could I start looking for him/her?<br>
   Should it be a book with us ( you, me and X ) as the authors or should we edit
   it. I have slight preference for the latter, as it does not involve too much
   writing from us - we contribute a chapter each. As far as the magazine/ journal
   is concerned, I am thinking that we should approach a non-IEEE Cs publication?!
   Aldavis shot our proposal down with a patriot missile.<br>
   Your reactions for the above please.</p>
