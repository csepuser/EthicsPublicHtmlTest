                   <p align="justify">PREAMBLE</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Graduates of an accredited program must demonstrate 
 
                     the ability to analyze, design, verify, validate, implement, 
 
                     and maintain software systems, using appropriate quality assurance 
 
                     techniques/methods in all of these. Graduates must understand

                     skills to function in a typical software development environment.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The following requirements are intended to 
 
                     provide a specification for software engineering programs 
 
                     that produce students meeting these objectives.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"><br>
 
                     FACULTY REQUIREMENTS</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The quality of the program is primarily dependent 
 
                     on the faculty. There must be sufficient faculty to provide 
 
                     course offerings that allow the students to complete the program 
 
                     in a timely manner, and provide direction and guidance to 
 
                     the students and to student teams. There must be sufficient 
 
                     full-time faculty to oversee the program as a whole, as well 
 
                     as the individual courses. The interests and qualifications 
 
                     of the faculty must be sufficient both to teach the necessary 
 
                     courses, and to plan and modify the curriculum. The faculty 
 
                     must be able to interact effectively with software practitioners. 
 
                     Faculty members teaching core software engineering courses 
 
                     should have substantial practical software engineering experience.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Teaching loads must be reasonable, and consistent 
 
                     with the program objectives, and the institutional expectations 
 
                     for research and professional development. Loads should also 
 
                     be consistent with other disciplines requiring significant 
 
                     project and laboratory work. Mechanism must exist to insure 
 
                     the professional growth and development of the faculty, as 
 
                     scholars, as educators, and as software practitioners. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">CURRICULUM</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Software engineering encompasses theory, 
 
                     technology, practice and application of software in computer-based 
 
                     systems. A central theme of the curriculum is to engender 
 
                     an engineering discipline in students, enabling them to define 
 
                     and use processes, models and metrics in software and system 
 
                     development. The curriculum integrates technical requirements 
 
                     with general education requirements and electives to prepare 
 
                     the student for a professional career in the field, for further 
 
                     study, and for functioning in modern society. The program 
 
                     must include approximately equal segments in software engineering, 
 
                     in computer science and engineering, in appropriate supporting 
 
                     areas, and in advanced materials. This material should cover 
 
                     about three-quarters of the overall academic program, with 
 
                     the remainder to include institutional requirements and electives. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The software engineering portion of the program 
 
                     covers processes and techniques for developing and maintaining 
 
                     large systems. Courses should address the areas of requirements 
 
                     analysis, software architecture and design, testing and quality 
 
                     assurance, software management, selection and use of software 
 
                     tools and components, computer and human interaction, maintenance 
 
                     and documentation. Substantial design work must be included 
 
                     and the students must be exposed to a variety of languages 
 
                     and systems. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Engineering responsibility and practice must 
 
                     be stressed, which includes conveying ethical, social, legal, 
 
                     economic and safety issues. These concerns must be reinforced 
 
                     in advanced work, as must the appropriate<br>
 
                     use of software engineering standards. Students should also 
 
                     learn methods for technical and economic decision making, 
 
                     such as project planning and resource management. Additionally, 
 
                     students must achieve<br>
 
                     an understanding of the need for and an ability to engage 
 
                     in life-long learning.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The computer science and engineering portion 
 
                     of the program must include the areas of algorithms and data 
 
                     structures, computer architecture, databases, programming 
 
                     languages, operating systems, and networking. The computer 
 
                     science principles in these areas should be integrated and 
 
                     applied in advanced software engineering courses and projects. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Included in the appropriate supporting areas 
 
                     are communications (oral, written, listening), including the 
 
                     abilities to work in teams, and mathematics focusing primarily 
 
                     on discrete mathematics and probability and statistics. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The advanced portion is designed to meet 
 
                     the objectives of the program by providing depth in one or 
 
                     more areas. This part of the program may incorporate further 
 
                     study in the software engineering and computer science topics 
 
                     indicated above, may involve work in additional areas of theory 
 
                     or technology, and should include work in one or more significant 
 
                     application domains. Particular domains may require additional 
 
                     work in supporting areas such as mathematics and science.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The program must address all aspects of software 
 
                     development and maintenance, and provide experience in a realistic 
 
                     team environment. These notions should be integrated throughout 
 
                     the program, which must<br>
 
                     incorporate a meaningful major project that integrates many 
 
                     aspects of the curriculum. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">LABORATORY AND COMPUTING RESOURCES</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The program requires substantial laboratory 
 
                     and computing resources for class work, individual projects, 
 
                     and team projects. These resources will normally involve a 
 
                     blend of computing facilities including workstations and communication 
 
                     facilities as well as resources for bulk data storage and 
 
                     printing. Sufficient facilities must be available so that 
 
                     all students have adequate and reasonable access to the appropriate 
 
                     system for each course, and for communicating with other students 
 
                     and faculty.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Adequate facilities must also exist to support 
 
                     the work of the faculty. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In addition to access to a variety of languages, 
 
                     operating systems, and database systems, it is essential to 
 
                     have access to commercial tools supporting various software 
 
                     development tasks. Appropriate licensing arrangements are 
 
                     necessary to insure that students have access to these resources.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In addition to software laboratories, which 
 
                     include clusters of computers and licensed software, there 
 
                     are needs for meeting space to support team projects. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Support services are required at a variety 
 
                     of levels including hardware maintenance, programming, software 
 
                     maintenance, systems management, documentation, and instructional 
 
                     training. The number of support staff with primary responsibility 
 
                     to the program must be consistent with the stated objectives 
 
                     of the program. A functioning laboratory plan addressing hardware 
 
                     and software development, acquisition, management, and maintenance 
 
                     must be present. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">STUDENTS</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The quality of a program is dependent on 
 
                     the quality of the students, as well as the faculty and institutional 
 
                     resources. There must be established standards and procedures 
 
                     to insure that graduates of the program have<br>
 
                     met both the requirements and the objectives of the programs 
 
                     so that they have the requisite qualifications to function 
 
                     effectively as software practitioners. In addition, there 
 
                     must be sufficient students enrolled in the program to insure 
 
                     that realistic projects and activities can be included. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">It is the responsibility of the faculty to 
 
                     facilitate and monitor the progress of the students. Appropriate 
 
                     measures, consistent with the institutional mission and program 
 
                     objectives, must exist to guide students toward completion 
 
                     of the program in a reasonable period of time, and to evaluate 
 
                     the success of the graduates in meeting the program objectives. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify"></p>
 
                   <p align="justify">INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">A. The organizational structure, fiscal policies, 
 
                     and instructional philosophy of an institution must assure 
 
                     that an accredited program will maintain its quality. Areas 
 
                     of institutional support that are considered especially important 
 
                     include the following:</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> 1. Faculty Support<br>
 
                     Many factors affect faculty recruitment and retention. Sabbatical 
 
                     and other leave programs, reasonable teaching loads, and competitive 
 
                     salaries are important in attracting and retaining faculty 
 
                     of high quality. There must be sufficient support to allow 
 
                     faculty members to attend national technical meetings with 
 
                     sufficient frequency to maintain competence as teachers, scholars 
 
                     and practitioners. There must also be support and recognition 
 
                     of scholarly activities. The advisory function of the faculty 
 
                     must be recognized by the institution and must be given appropriate 
 
                     administrative support. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> 2. Administration<br>
 
                     All levels of administration are relevant to the program. 
 
                     Positive, constructive leadership at the college/school level 
 
                     and in the unit that administers the program are especially 
 
                     important in maintaining the<br>
 
                     program quality. Adequate time must be assigned for the administration 
 
                     of the program. Upper levels of administration must provide 
 
                     the program with the resources and atmosphere to function 
 
                     effectively with the<br>
 
                     rest of the institution. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> 3. Library<br>
 
                     The faculty and students in the software engineering program 
 
                     must have access to appropriate media resources, supported 
 
                     by professional information specialists who can assist in 
 
                     finding necessary materials in a traditional library collection 
 
                     or on the Internet. The technical collection must provide 
 
                     appropriate access to up-to-date texts, reference works, and 
 
                     publications of professional and research organizations that 
 
                     are relevant to the program, including conference proceedings, 
 
                     newsletters, technical reports, and trade publications.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> 4. Support Services<br>
 
                     The institution must provide modern office equipment such 
 
                     as word processors and duplicating equipment. In addition, 
 
                     administrative support must be consistent with the type of 
 
                     program and level of scholarly and<br>
 
                     practitioner activity. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">B. Assessment of Program Effectiveness</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> The effectiveness of the program must be 
 
                     evaluated on a regular basis. This evaluation must be documented, 
 
                     and information gained through this activity should be seriously 
 
                     considered as improvements are made in the program. Formal 
 
                     evaluation mechanisms must be part of program administration 
 
                     (for example, an advisory board of active software practitioners 
 
                     meeting with the program faculty at regular intervals). Effectiveness 
 
                     measures should also include monitoring of student placement 
 
                     experience and tracking the professional development of students.
