         ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS </p>
       <p>The ideas of this paper were developed as part of an ongoing effort to 
         establish more precise ethical guidelines for computer professionals. 
         A joint IEEE Computer Society / ACM Task Force for Software Engineering 
         Ethics and Professional Practices (SEEPP) was working when I drafted several 
         versions of this paper. That work is now being carried on by the Professional 
         Competence Standards Task Force. A list of people who were emailed versions 
         of this paper is available. Their contributions to this document are too 
         numerous to mention individually, but each is acknowledged here. </p>
       <p>INTRODUCTION </p>
       <p>All professionals have responsibilities and privileges due to their role. 
         Computer professionals are trusted to make technical decisions about software 
         and hardware. These decisions require sensitivity to human values as well 
         as technical expertise. </p>
       <p>[1] The interaction of human values and technical decisions is particularly 
         important in the area of software quality. The question of &quot;how good 
         is good enough&quot; requires values clarification, allocation of resources, 
         prediction of costs, and analyses and predictions that cannot be based 
         on certainty, but should be based on measurement.</p>
       <p>[2] Most software is so complex that guaranteeing perfection in product 
         quality, while highly desirable, is infeasible. However, guaranteeing 
         adherence to mutually agreed-upon development processes from which product 
         quality can be expected to flow is feasible. In the suggestions below 
         we insist that both product and process be addressed when dealing with 
         professional responsibilities for software quality. We propose that computer 
         professionals adopt an ethical standard of &quot;informed consent,&quot; 
         as outlined below. </p>
       <p>GUIDING PRINCIPLE A software developer should obtain informed consent 
         from the client. A software user should have available information about 
         the safety and reliability of software. The public should be able to obtain 
         detailed information about the testing and reliability measures of any 
         commercial software. </p>
       <p>DEFINITIONS &quot;software&quot; : computer programs, internal documentation, 
         design documents, test plans, user manuals, online help, and the like 
         &quot;software developer&quot; : any professional involved in the production 
         of computer software; this includes but is not limited to designers, coders, 
         testers, managers, and salespeople &quot;client&quot; : the person or 
         entity that pays for the software &quot;user&quot; : any human who interacts 
         with the software &quot;public&quot; : any citizen or organization &quot;informed 
         consent&quot;: see below INFORMED CONSENT &quot;Informed consent&quot; 
         is a term used in medical ethics. [3] We borrow this term and define it 
         for computer professionals as follows: The client of a computer professional 
         who is buying software should be given sufficient information to make 
         a reasonable choice about investing in the software. The developer should 
         disclose information at an appropriate level of detail. The acceptance 
         of the client should be voluntary, and should include a formal authorization 
         whenever possible.</p>
       <p> Words such as &quot;sufficient,&quot; &quot;reasonable,&quot; and &quot;appropriate&quot; 
         can only be defined specific to a particular situation. Part of a professional's 
         responsibility in informed consent is to make these definitions in a good 
         faith for each particular exchange with a client. Sometimes the people 
         who buy software are remote from the developer; for example, shrink wrapped 
         software clients. In this case &quot;informed consent&quot; will not be 
         formalized in the same way that it can be when custom software is developed 
         for an individual client. </p>
       <p>However, informed consent can be approximated in this cases by a good 
         faith effort to make disclosure information available to a customer before 
         purchase. Except for those cases where the client cannot be negotiated 
         with directly (such as shrink-wrapped software), we assume below that 
         the client or a representative of the client is available. When the client 
         is not available for direct consultation, the quantifiable information 
         required for informed consent should be available to customers shopping 
         for software. IMPLEMENTATION OF INFORMED CONSENT The developer should 
         create as part of a contract or as a separate document an informed consent 
         form. </p>
       <p>This document discloses the information presented by the developer about 
         software quality, and the client's willingness to accept the software 
         knowing the measurements and limitations included in that document. Informed 
         consent is complete when both the developer and the client sign the document. 
         CONTENTS OF AN INFORMED CONSENT DOCUMENT </p>
       <p>I.Product Measurements: This section includes any and all software quality 
         measures agreed to by the developer and the client. These could include 
         mean-time-to-failure under a certain distribution of inputs; software 
         metrics, either as an average or within an acceptable range over all modules; 
         safety conditions that are never violated after a certain number of random 
         tests; or any other repeatable, verifiable measures. When presenting the 
         informed consent document for signing, the developer demonstrates that 
         the software meets or exceeds the agreed upon measures. </p>
       <p>Measures must be defined in such detail (such as margins for error, significant 
         digits, rounding protocols) as to be unambiguous. Each measurement should 
         be defined in a single reference document that includes this type of detail.</p>
       <p> II. Process Description: This section describes the processes used to 
         develop the software and to verify its software quality. The developer 
         describes how adherence to the process guidelines is verified. Each process 
         must be described in a single defining reference document.</p>
       <p> III. Assessment implementation: This section details who assesses compliance 
         with the product measurements and the process requirements. This section 
         may include details about who is responsible for what in the assessment 
         phase; for example, either the client or the developer may be responsible 
         for the generation of test cases. CONTRACT RAMIFICATIONS Informed consent 
         should be a binary transaction: either the two parties mutually accept 
         it, or they do not. </p>
       <p>Mutual acceptance of an informed consent document is part of the final 
         phase of a software project. The development of the document should begin 
         in the earliest phases of development, but it cannot be signed until all 
         the described measurements and assessments have been completed. A contract 
         can make reference to the time when this document is signed to determine 
         bonuses or penalties, but the document itself should focus on software 
         quality, not schedule or payment. </p>
       <p>The issues of time and money are a vital part of the negotiations between 
         client and developer on what level of quality are acceptable; however, 
         informed consent, once agreed to, becomes a required step in acceptance. 
         Renegotiating informed consent is possible, but not encouraged. INFORMED 
         CONSENT DOCUMENTS AS PUBLIC ARCHIVES The informed consent document is 
         made available by the developer in paper form (at minimal cost) and electronically 
         (without cost) to the public. User documentation gives information about 
         how to access the document. The IEEE Computer Society maintains a directory 
         to all such electronic documents for publicly available software.(The 
         IEEE Computer Society has not yet been asked to maintain such a repository. 
         This informed consent standard is merely a suggestion at the moment.) 
       </p>
       <p>WHY THIS MIGHT WORK The description above does not require any particular 
         style of testing or verification. We do not expect the research or business 
         community to reach consensus about which techniques are necessary or sufficient. 
         But this informed consent form does require mutually agreed to measurements 
         of some kind. This seems like a minimum level of professionalism. [4] 
         [5] By not including contractual details in the document, parties to the 
         consent should be willing to make the document public. </p>
       <p>A collection of documents could be a rich source of information for researchers 
         in software quality, and public display of these documents would encourage 
         more responsibility from developers and clients. Many of us are convinced 
         that we have to do something to encourage professionalism in software 
         development. Perhaps an informed consent emphasis will help.</p>
