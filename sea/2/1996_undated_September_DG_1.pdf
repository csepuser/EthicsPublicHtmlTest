                  <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
                  <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, 
                    industry, government, medicine, entertainment, and ordinary 
                    life. Because the utility of computers depends in large part 
                    on the 
                    instructions written for them, those who design, develop, 
                    and test software have enormous opportunities both to do good 
                    and to cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, that this 
                    power will 
                    be used for good, software engineers commit themselves to 
                    making the design, development, and testing of software a 
                    distinct, beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance 
                    with that 
                    commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the following 
                    standards of conduct. The seven main paragraphs state general 
                    rules. Each subsidiary clause is a specific application of 
                    its general rule, one experience has shown needs express statement; 
                    but no set of subsidiary clauses exhausts the general rule.</p>
                  <p>Rule 1: PRODUCT. </p>
                  <p>Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, Assure that 
                    the software on which they work is useful to public, employer, 
                    customer, and user, completed on time and at reasonable cost, 
                    and free of significant error. In particular, software engineers 
                    shall, as appropriate:</p>
                  <p> 1.01. Assure that specifications for software on which they 
                    work have been put in writing, satisfy the user's requirements, 
                    and have the customer's approval. </p>
                  <p>1.02. Assure that they understand fully the specifications 
                    for software on which they work.</p>
                  <p> 1.03. Assure that they are qualified, by education and experience,

                  <p> 1.05. Assure proper development methodology on any project 
                    on which they work. </p>
                  <p>1.06. Assure proper management on any project on which they 
                    work, including proper procedures for control of quality and 
                    risk. </p>
                  <p>1.07. Assure proper estimates of cost, schedule, personnel, 
                    and outcome on any project on which they work.</p>
                  <p> 1.08. Assure adequate documentation on any projec on which 
                    they work, including a log of problems discovered and solutions 
                    adopted.</p>
                  <p> 1.09. Assure proper testing, debugging, and review of software 
                    and related documents on which they work.</p>
                  <p> 1.10. Assure that software and related documents on which 
                    they work respect the privacy of those who will be subject 
                    to the software.</p>
                  <p> 1.11 Assure that raw information used in software is accurate, 
                    derives from a legitimate source, and is used only in ways 
                    properly authorized.</p>
                  <p> 1.12. Assure ethical, economic, cultural, legal and environmental 
                    issues are properly identified, defined, and addressed.</p>
                  <p> 1.13. Promote maximum productivity and minimum cost to employer, 
                    customer, user, and public. </p>
                  <p>1.14. Avoid fads, departing from standard practices only 
                    when justified.</p>
                  <p>Rule 2: PUBLIC.</p>
                  <p> Software engineers shall, in their professional role, act 
                    only in ways consistent with the public safety, health and 
                    welfare. In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
                  <p> 2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons any danger that the 
                    software or related documents on which they work may pose 
                    to the user, a third party, or the environment. </p>
                  <p>2.02. Approve software only if they have a well?documentedbelief 
                    that it is safe, meets specifications, and has passed all 
                    appropriate tests. </p>
                  <p>2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared under

                  <p> 2.07. Accept full responsibility for their own work.</p>

                  <p>3.04. Accept payment from only one party for any particular

                  <p>4.07. Inform client or employer promptly if, in their opinion, 
                    a project is likely to fail, to prove too expensive, to violate
