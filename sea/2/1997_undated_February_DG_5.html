                   <p>(1) Principle 1: PRODUCT.</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, 
 
                     assure that the software on which they work is useful (2) 
 
                     and of 
 
                     acceptable quality to the public, the employer, the (3) client, 
 
                     and the 
 
                     user, completed on time and at reasonable cost, and free of 
 
                     (3a) error.  
 
                     In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate: </p>
 
                   <blockquote> 
 
                     <p> 1.01. (4)Ensure that specifications for software on which 
 
                       they work have been (5)well documented, satisfy the user's 
 
                       requirements, and have the client's approval.</p>
 
                     <p> 1.02. (6) Strive to understand fully the specifications 
 
                       for software on which they work. </p>
 
                     <p>1.03. (4)Ensure that they are qualified, by an (7)appropriate 
 
                       combination of education and experience, for any project 
 
                       on which they work (8)or propose to work. </p>
 
                     <p>1.04. (4)Ensure proper goals and objectives for any project 
 
                       on which they work.</p>
 
                     <p> 1.05 (4)Ensure (9)an appropriate (9a) methodology on any 
 
                       project for which they work(8) or propose to work. </p>
 
                     <p>1.06. (4)Ensure (9) good management on any project for 
 
                       which they work, including (9) effective procedures for 
 
                       (9b) promotion of quality and reduction of risk. </p>
 
                     <p>1.07. (4)Ensure (9)realistic estimates of cost, scheduling, 
 
                       personnel, and outcome on any project on which they work 
 
                       (8)or propose to work. </p>
 
                     <p>1.08. (4)Ensure adequate documentation for any project 
 
                       on which they work, including a log of problems discovered 
 
                       and solutions adopted. </p>
 
                     <p>1.09. (4)Ensure (9) adequate testing, debugging, and review 
 
                       of software and related documents on which they work. </p>
 
                     <p>1.10. (10) Aspire to develop software and related documents 
 
                       that respect the privacy of those who will be subjected 
 
                       to that software. </p>
 
                     <p>1.11 (10)Be careful to use only accurate data derived from 
 
                       legal sources and use only in ways properly authorized. 
 
                     </p>
 
                     <p>1.12. (10)Aspire to identify, define and address ethical, 
 
                       economic, cultural, legal, and environmental issues.</p>
 
                     <p> 1.13. Promote maximum (11) quality and minimum cost to 
 
                       the employer, the (3) client, the user, and the public (11a) 
 
                       and make any tradeoffs clear to all parties concerned. </p>
 
                     <p>1.14. (10) Aspire to follow industry standards that are 
 
                       most appropriate for the task at hand, departing from these 
 
                       only when technically justified.</p>
 
                   </blockquote>
 
                   <p align="left">Principle 2: PUBLIC.</p>
 
                   <p>Software engineers shall, in their professional role, act 
 
                     only in ways consistent with the public safety, health and 
 
                     welfare. In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
 
                   <blockquote> 
 
                     <p> 2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons (12) or authorities 
 
                       any (13) actual or potential danger that the software or 
 
                       related documents on which they work,(14) or are aware of, 
 
                       may pose to the user, a third party, or the environment.</p>
 
                     <p> 2.02. Approve software only if they have a well-(15)founded 
 
                       belief that it is safe, meets specifications, has passed 
 
                       (15a) appropriate tests,(16) and does not diminish quality 
 
                       of life or harm the environment.</p>
 
                     <p> 2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared 
 
                       under their supervision (17) or within their areas of competence 
 
                       (17a) and with which they are in agreement. </p>
 
                     <p>2.04. Co-operate in efforts to (18) address matters of 
 
                       grave public concern in software or related documents. </p>
 
                     <p>2.05. Be fair and truthful in all (19) statements, particularly 
 
                       public ones, concerning software or related documents. </p>
 
                     <p>2.06. Not put self-interest, the interest of an employer, 
 
                       the interest of a client (3), or the interest of the user 
 
                       ahead of the public's interest.</p>
 
                     <p> 2.07. Accept full responsibility for their own work.</p>
 
                   </blockquote>
 
                   <p>Principle 3: JUDGMENT.</p>
 
                   <p> Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, protect both 
 
                     the independence of their professional judgment and their 
 
                     reputation for such judgment. In particular, software engineers 
 
                     shall, as appropriate:</p>
 
                   <p align="center"><strong>Modifications to Principles 1 and 
 
                     2 </strong></p>
 
                   <p>1. Change &quot;Rule&quot; to &quot;Principle&quot; since 
 
                     these are not really single rules but statements that embody 
 
                     a sets of activities. This change lessens the possibility 
 
                     of misreading of the code as a checklist,.</p>
 
                   <p>2. This introduces professional commitment to quality at 
 
                     an early level and helps to answer the &quot;who is to say&quot; 
 
                     question.</p>
 
                   <p>3. Replace all uses of word 'customer with word 'client'. 
 
                     'Client' is a less domain specific word. In a maintenance 
 
                     situation the client is the person who delivered the task 
 
                     to you. Client could also be a student or the professional 
 
                     receiving services from the professional organization. This 
 
                     change introduces some consistency missing from later clauses. 
 
                     &quot;Client&quot; is a person using the services of X.</p>
 
                   <p>3a. We felt uncomfortable with the phrase 'significant error'. 
 
                     It may be used as an escape clause- 'I had lots of errors 
 
                     but didn't think any of them significant'. Instead we deleted 
 
                     the word 'significant' and handled more detail about error 
 
                     in Principle 2. ???????? There is still some concern with 
 
                     this change because it is not possible to write error free 
 
                     code. Any suggestions for balancing these concerns? </p>
 
                   <p>4. Replace 'assure&quot; with &quot;ensure&quot;. 'Ensure' 
 
                     is less legal than 'assure' which carries a formal guarantee 
 
                     and legal connotation (according to the OED); whilst 'ensure' 
 
                     means to strive to make a thing happen and no formal guarantee 
 
                     is implied. This change is made for most future occurrences 
 
                     of 'assure'. </p>
 
                   <p>5. Replace 'in writing' with more generic 'well documented' 
 
                     to allow for multimedia capture of specifications. </p>
 
                   <p>6. Replace 'assure' with 'Strive to'; used a purely aspirational 
 
                     term here to placate those who appeal to impossibility of 
 
                     precise specs. </p>
 
                   <p>7. Change ' education and experience ' to ' an appropriate 
 
                     combination of education and experience' to include those 
 
                     who have good technical knowledge and to make clear that 'qualified 
 
                     by education' does not imply paper qualification. </p>
 
                   <p>8. Add clause to 1.03.1.05, and 1.07 'or propose to work' 
 
                     because this encourages a professionals commitment to develop 
 
                     the requisite skills prior to taking on new responsibilities.</p>
 
                   <p>9. Replace 'proper' in several clauses with a less vague 
 
                     phrase. For example in this clause there are technical answers 
 
                     to the question 'which methods are appropriate?'</p>
 
                   <p>9a Delete word 'development' because software engineers may 
 
                     do more than develop a product, e.g, conduct product audit.</p>
 
                   <p>9b Rephase to reduce risk, not eliminate it. Clauses 1.01-1.09 
 
                     are more technical than 1.10-1.14. It is in these latter clauses 
 
                     where we started to more emphatically introduce a professional's 
 
                     commitments to society embodied in product development.</p>
 
                   <p>10 Used more aspirational and intentional phrase for these 
 
                     level 1 type obligations in 1.10-1.14</p>
 
                   <p>11 Replace &quot;productivity&quot; with &quot;quality&quot;.</p>
 
                   <p>11a add &quot;and make tradeoffs clear to all parties concerned&quot; 
 
                     which acknowledges the clients right to informed consent</p>
 
                   <p>Principle 2</p>
 
                   <p>12 Insert word &quot;authorities&quot; because want to refer 
 
                     to someone who can remedy the problem.</p>
 
                   <p>13 Insert 'actual or potential' because if we only respond 
 
                     to actual dangers then one does not have an obligation to 
 
                     address potential dangers.</p>
 
                   <p>14 Added 'or are aware of' because as stated, you only have 
 
                     obligations to report dangers of projects you are working 
 
                     on. Someone next to you can be working on a dangerous project 
 
                     and even if you are aware of the danger it poses, there is 
 
                     no stated obligation to address the problem. Both ACM and 
 
                     IEEE code require the reporting of dangers 'you are aware 
 
                     of'. </p>
 
                   <p>15 Replace 'well-documented' with 'well-founded'.</p>
 
                   <p>15a Delete 'all' to avoid the suggestion that exhaustive 
 
                     testing is required</p>
 
                   <p>16. Added specific commitments to protect the public and 
 
                     the ability to use the approval process to do it.</p>
 
                   <p>17. Replace 'and' with 'or' to allow for approvals where 
 
                     the SE is not in a supervisory role. </p>
 
                   <p>17a. add &quot;and to which they are in agreement&quot; otherwise 
 
                     clause requires you to sign all things just because they are 
 
                     in your area of expertise.</p>
 
                   <p>18. Restructured this statement to address a public issue. 
 
                     As stated this clause was strictly product related. </p>
 
                   <p>19 The clause as it stood indicated that it was ok to lie 
 
                     in non public statements.</p>
 
                   <p></p>
