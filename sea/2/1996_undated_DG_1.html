       <div align="center"><strong>THE FUNCTIONS OF PROFESSIONAL CODES IN AN EMERGING
           PROFESSION: A HIERARCHY OF FUNCTIONS </strong></div>
       <p></p>
       <p>It is important for emerging professions to develop a code of ethics.
         There are divergent views about such codes. From a negative standpoint
         some have argued that such codes are merely a self serving attempt to
         generate a positive public image. Others claim that such codes merely
         establish a moral minimum and are incomplete. As an emerging profession
         develops a code it is important to keep these negative judgements in
         mind, but it is more important to consider the positive functions of
         codes. Since some of these functions may be incompatible it is important
         to identify and to emphasize those characteristics of a code which are
         most important to the particular profession.</p>
       <p>Many professional societies, such as the British Computer Society, use
         a hierarchy of types of code. They distinguish between codes of ethics,
         of conduct, and of practice. Often the failure to distinguish between
         the structure and roles of these different types of code has led to confusion
         when interpreting the code(s) of a professional organization. Some codes
         embody elements from all three types without clearly distinguishing which
         role a particular imperative is supposed to serve. </p>
       <p>They relationship between these types of code form a hierarchy. Codes
         of ethics as distinguished from codes of conduct and codes of practice
         are more aspirational. They are mission statements for the professional
         providing vision and objectives. Codes of conduct are more oriented toward
         the professional and professional attitudes. They do not describe details
         about how to carry out a particular action, but they make clear the issues
         at stake in different specialized fields, telecommunications, software
         construction etc. Codes of practice may fix some accepted state of the
         art ( Berleur, J). Although each of these roles for a code are both normative
         and prescriptive, one cannot expect the same level of enforcement for
         each role. Codes of ethics which are primarily aspirational use no more
         than light coercion, while violations of codes of conduct generally carry
         sanctions ranging from warnings to exclusion from the profession. Violations
         of codes of practice may lead to legal action on the grounds of malpractice
         or negligence. </p>
       <p>This hierarchy of codes parallels the three levels of professional ethics.
         All professionals, by virtue of their humanity share a common set of
         shared values with other human beings. By virtue of their role as professionals
         and their special skils, they owe a higher order of ethical obligation
         then would be owed if they were not professionals. This level of ethical
         obligation is also shared by every professinal. The third level of professional
         ethics is the set of distinct ethical obligations within the context
         of a particular profession. Professional codes of ethics need to address
         all three levels. </p>
       <p>Several professional societies in their codes and documents about them
         and authors on ethics have distinguished several functions and audiences
         for codes of ethics. A matrix , whose vertical axis is the different
         roles of code and whose horizontal axis consists of the significant functions
         of t he code for the emerging profession, can be used in the development
         of a professional code. </p>
       <p>The following categories encompass the functions of the codes indicated
         by professionl societies and authors on professional issues for engineers
         and computers scientists.</p>
       <p><strong>INSPIRATION </strong></p>
       <p>Codes are designed to be inspirational. There are two audiences for
         such inspiration. Matrin (M&amp;S) emphasizes the inspiration for &quot;positive
         stimulus for ethical conduct by the practitioner&quot;, while Johnson
         emphasizes a code's function to inspire confidence of the customer or
         user in the computing artifact and its creator. The use of language with
         positive overtones helps to generate both types of inspiration but such
         language also introduces a degree of vagueness which limits the ability
         of the code to help guide professional behavior.</p>
       <p>Thus the inspirational function of a code has implications for the physical
         structure of a code. Although some people prefer brief codes, many have
         argued that a code which is both brief and inspiration really provides
         little guidance for behavior. To address this problem, organizations
         like the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology, American
         Society of Civil Engineers, and the Association for Computing Machinery
         have developed codes which are accompanied by a set of guidelines which
         can appear separately or intermeshed with the basic imperatives.</p>
       <p><strong>GUIDANCE </strong></p>
       <p>Historically, there has been a transition away from regulatory codes
         designed to penalize divergent behavior and internal dissent, toward
         codes which are more normative; Such normative codes are only a partial
         representation of the ethical standards of the profession's members.(Anderson
         1994, Gotterbarn 1996) These more normative codes are not considered
         as exhaustive lists of rights or wrongs; nor are they considered algorthims
         to decide what is wrong.. The use of normative codes requires moral judgement
         on part of professional. Professional societies provide help in difficult
         moral cases; the American Bar Association publishes opinions on difficult
         cases and the Board of Ethical Review of the National Society of Professional
         Engineers publishes opinions on how the code can be applied to specific
         cases. A sense of moral responsibility is needed for the application
         of the code to concrete situation.</p>
       <p><strong>EDUCATION</strong></p>
       <p> Most authorities on codes emphasize the educational function of codes.
         They serve to educate both prospective members and existing member of
         a profession. </p>
       <p>Codes educate them about the shared commitment of the members of a particular
         profession to do a certain quality of work and be concerned about the
         well being of the customer and user of the developed product. </p>
       <p>They also serve to educate the managers of the professional about expected
         behavior. The manager's expectations will have an effect on what is asked
         of the professional. Directly and indirectly codes educate management
         about their responsibility for effects of the products developed.</p>
       <p>Codes also serve a function of indirectly educating the public at large
         about what the professionals consider to be a minimal acceptable practice
         in that field, even if practiced by a non-professional. </p>
       <p><strong>SUPPORT FOR POSITIVE ACTION</strong></p>
       <p> Codes provide a level of support for the engineer who decides to take
         positive action. They provide an environment in which it will be easier
         than it would otherwise be to resist pressure to do what the engineer
         would rather not do. The appeal to the imperatives of a code can be used
         as a counter pressure to urging by others to have the professional act
         in ways inconsistent with a pattern of behavior supported by a consensus
         of the profession. The effectiveness of appeals to a code are related
         to the type of sanctions related to violations of the code. For example
         doctors are encouraged to write prescriptions in accordance with legal
         guidelines. Recent failures to follow these standards has recently led
         to 900 physicians no longer being allowed to write prescriptions. DETERRENCE
         AND DISCIPLINE This is the other side of the support for positive action.
         Codes can serve as a formal basis for action against a professional.
         Some organizations revoke membership or suspend licenses to practice.</p>
       <p><strong>ENHANCE PROFESSION'S PUBLIC IMAGE</strong> </p>
       <p>Some codes specify a minimal standard of conduct. Sometimes this is
         done at great ethical cost. Codes used to prohibit public criticism of
         fellow professional's even if they violated some ethical standard</p>
       <p>For an emerging profession, some of these functions are more critical
         than others. The choice of function will give the code its own character.
         Because many software engineering projects are team projects and the
         software engineer is not always in a decision making position, the support
         function is very important. Since the profession is an emerging one,
         the educational and inspirational functions are also important. At this
         stage of the development of software engineering the disciplinary function
         is being taken over by the law. In most contemporary codes, the attempt
         to keep a perfect public image at the expense of quality development
         has been abandoned. For example both the IEEE-CS and ACM codes require
         that a professional attempts to rectify violations of the code, even
         to the point of whistleblowing. </p>
       <p>It is the first four functions which should be addressed in the development
         of a software engineering code of ethics.</p>
