                   <div align="justify">Dear Task Force Members: </div>
 
                   <p align="justify">Below is a copy of the main body of code 
 
                     of ethics which has been modified to address reviews received 
 
                     from a several of sources. The changes to the Preamble are 
 
                     being worked on now. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The architecture of the code v2.0 is similar 
 
                     to version 1.0. It will start out with a preamble or introduction 
 
                     explaining the functions of the code and guidelines on its 
 
                     use. This is followed by a series of keyword principles describing 
 
                     a software engineer's obligations in a variety of relationships. 
 
                     Associated with each of these keyword principles is a high 
 
                     level description of the software engineer's obligations. 
 
                     These are each followed by a series of clauses detailing some 
 
                     of the obligations under this Principle. These obligations 
 
                     are taken from all three levels of obligation in a professional 
 
                     code of ethics- level 1 representing obligations shared with 
 
                     all other human beings, level 2 obligations which are shared 
 
                     by all professionals, level 3 obligations which are specific 
 
                     to software engineering.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The architecture of this code, major principles, 
 
                     followed by explanations or examples, is fairly common, e.g., 
 
                     it is used by the NSPE and the British Computer Society. The 
 
                     use of an explanatory Preamble to explain the role of the 
 
                     code and instructions that the code should not be considered 
 
                     as a complete list of professional ethical obligations is 
 
                     also quite common. For example, all codes used in the architecture 
 
                     table follow this format. The Code v2.0 differs from most 
 
                     other codes in two ways. First, the code is different in its 
 
                     use of keyword Principles indicating obligations based on 
 
                     professional relationships. Some codes, like the Australian 
 
                     Computer Society Code of Ethics, also use keyword principles. 
 
                     The SE code differs in that its keywords are tied to professional 
 
                     relationships. Works on computer ethics have found this organization 
 
                     useful in covering the topics of professionalism and useful 
 
                     as a good nmonic device. The code also differs from other 
 
                     code by clearly addressing, in the preamble, the difference 
 
                     between the three levels of professional obligation and organizing 
 
                     the clauses under each principle around these three levels. 
 
                   </p>

                     WOULD YOU PLEASE READ THROUGH THIS DRAFT OF THE CODE AND GIVE 
 
                     US YOUR COMMENTS. IF YOU DISLIKE SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE,

                     the task to you. Client could also be a student or the professional 
 
                     receiving services from the professional organization. This 
 
                     change introduces some consistency missing from later clauses. 
 
                     &quot;Client&quot; is a person using the services of X.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">3a. We felt uncomfortable with the phrase 
 
                     'significant error'. It may be used as an escape clause- 'I 
 
                     had lots of errors but didn't think any of them significant'. 
 
                     Instead we deleted the word 'significant' and handled more 
 
                     detail about error in Principle 2.<br>
 
                     ???????? There is still some concern with this change because 
 
                     it is not possible to write error free code. Any suggestions 
 
                     for balancing these concerns? </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">4. Replace 'assure&quot; with &quot;ensure&quot;. 
 
                     'Ensure' is less legal than 'assure' which carries a formal 
 
                     guarantee and legal connotation (according to the OED); whilst 
 
                     'ensure' means to strive to make a thing happen and no formal 
 
                     guarantee is implied. This change is made for most future 
 
                     occurrences of 'assure'. <br>
 
                     .<br>
 
                     5. Replace 'in writing' with more generic 'well documented' 
 
                     to allow for multimedia capture of specifications. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">6. Replace 'assure' with 'Strive to'; used 
 
                     a purely aspirational term here to placate those who appeal 
 
                     to impossibility of precise specs. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">7. Change ' and' to 'or' in 1.03 to include 
 
                     those who have good technical knowledge and to make clear 
 
                     that 'qualified by education' does not imply paper qualification. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">8. Add clause to 1.03.1.05, and 1.07 'or 
 
                     propose to work' because this encourages a professionals commitment 
 
                     to develop the requisite skills prior to taking on new responsibilities.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">9. Replace 'proper' in several clauses with 
 
                     a less vague phrase. For example in this clause there are 
 
                     technical answers to the question 'which methods are appropriate?'</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Clause 1.01-1.09 are more technical than 
 
                     1.10-1.14. It is in these latter clauses where we started 
 
                     to more emphatically introduce a professional's commitments 
 
                     to society embodied in product development.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">10 Used more aspirational and intentional 
 
                     phrase for these level 1 type obligations in 1.10-1.14</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">11 Replace &quot;productivity&quot; with 
 
                     &quot;quality&quot;.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">11a add &quot;and make tradeoffs clear to

                   <p align="justify">Principle 2</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">12 Insert word &quot;authorities&quot; because 
 
                     want to refer to someone who can remedy the problem.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">13 Insert 'actual or potential' because if 
 
                     we only respond to actual dangers then one does not have an 
 
                     obligation to address potential dangers.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">14 Added 'or are aware of' because as stated, 
 
                     you only have obligations to report dangers of projects you 
 
                     are working on. Someone next to you can be working on a dangerous 
 
                     project and even if you are aware of the danger it poses, 
 
                     there is no stated obligation to address the problem. Both 
 
                     ACM and IEEE code require the reporting of dangers 'you are 
 
                     aware of'. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">15 Replace 'well-documented' with 'well-founded'.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">15a Delete 'all' to avoid the suggestion 
 
                     that exhaustive testing is required</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">16. Added specific commitments to protect 
 
                     the public and the ability to use the approval process to 
 
                     do it.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">17. Replace 'and' with 'or' to allow for

                   <p align="justify">17a. add &quot;and to which they are in agreement&quot;

                   <p align="justify">18. Restructured this statement to address
