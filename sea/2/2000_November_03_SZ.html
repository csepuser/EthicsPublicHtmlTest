       <p>Dennis,</p>
       <p>The IEEE Computer Society was informed on July 7, 2000 (see letter below)
         that ACM was withdrawing from SWECC. Our withdrawal was effective that
         date. It is inappropriate for IEEE-CS to be asking for ACM representation
         on SWECC.</p>
       <p>Regarding on-going activities, ACM is continuing to fund the curriculum
         work led by Richard LaBlanc and managed by the Education Board. It is
         continuing to fund ethics work through the ACM Committee on Professional
         Ethics. ACM is working with many societies on the Information Technology
         Profession Initiative. Both Bruce Eisenstein (IEEE President) and Doris
         Carver (past IEEE-CS) are on the Steering Committee.</p>
       <p>Barbara Simons is following up with Guylaine Pollack on behalf of the
         Executive Committee to ensure any remaining issues around our withdrawal
         from SWECC are resolved.</p>

       <p>Guylaine Pollack IEEE Computer Society Washington D.C.</p>
       <p>Dear Guylaine,</p>
       <p>In a vote completed June 30, 2000 the Council of the ACM has (without
         objection) directed that the Association withdraw from the Software Engineering
         Coordinating Committee (SWECC). This action was taken after 18 months
         of evaluation of the goals, direction, and progress of SWECC and its
         various projects. Accordingly, this letter is to inform you that ACM
         is withdrawing from SWECC. A full report on our decision to withdraw
         will be made available shortly. A summary of the ACM position is included
         with this letter.</p>
       <p>While the decision to withdraw from SWECC has been made, the Executive
         Committee of the ACM is eager to explore new ways of working together
         with the Computer Society to make substantive progress on the problem
         of improving the quality of software systems and the capabilities of
         software engineers. The Executive Committee feels there are areas in
         which</p>
       <p> <br>
   on-going activities should continue (e.g., education and curricula) and new
     areas in which joint projects and initiatives should be considered (e.g.,
     the Information Technology Profession Initiative). Representatives of the
     Executive Committee will be at the upcoming Snowbird Conference and look
     forward to having informal conversations with the Computer Society about
     new ways of working together on this difficult, but important, problem.</p>

   To: Bourne, Steve; White, John<br>
   Cc: ACM-Executive-Committee; ACM Council<br>
   Subject: Completing the ACM pullout from SWEcc</p>
       <p>&gt; &gt; Because the IEEE Computer Society executive board<br>
   meets next week and will address this matter, I recommend immediate attention.</p>
       <p>The bylaws of SWEcc, to which ACM and the IEEE Computer Society mutually
         agreed several years ago, call for an ACM representative to become chair
         of SWEcc as of January 1, 2001, for a 2 year period. (SWEcc is the software
         engineering coordinating committee, under the auspices of which there
         are four projects associated with establishing software engineering as
         a profession.)</p>
       <p>Although the ACM Council, under the previous executive committee, announced
         its intention to pull out of SWEcc on June 30, 2000, the details of making
         this happen were left to the next executive committee and nothing formal
         has been proposed or agreed to by the ACM and the Computer Society. ACM's
         announced intention was to seek an arrangement that would preserve some
         of the projects currently under SWEcc. The position of the computer society
         seems to be that SWEcc remains as a formal entity chartered by both societies
         to oversee these projects and will proceed as currently established until
         the Society and ACM agree to a resolution of this issue.</p>
       <p>In the absence of such an agreement by January 1, ACM will be obligated
         to provide a chair of SWEcc. I have received a request from the computer
         society to identify whom the ACM chair will be, presumably so that an
         orderly transition of</p>
       <p> <br>
   responsibility may take place. As ACM's primary representative to SWEcc, that
     obligation would fall on me, barring a change in ACM's representation or
     a formal resolution of the ACM withdrawal proposal.</p>
       <p>I am not willing to serve in that capacity when my sole purpose as ACM's
         representative would be to dismantle something I have spent 7 years building
         on ACM's behalf. I continue to believe that deciding to withdraw was
         a mistake on ACM's part.</p>
       <p>I would be happy to provide my insight on these matters or my perspective
         on the background if the new executive committee needs this information.
         In any case, I urge that action be taken to resolve this issue, since
         otherwise it leaves ACM in an awkward position at best.</p>
