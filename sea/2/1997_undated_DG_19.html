                   <p align="justify">Dear David,</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Thank you for your carfeul evaluation of 
 
                     the draft Software Engineering Code of Ethics. I am sorry 
 
                     for the delay in getting back to you but I wanted to clear 
 
                     my response to your concerns with the rest of the committee. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">We are also getting reponses from the publication 
 
                     of the Code in the Communications of the ACM and in Computer, 
 
                     so some of our responses to your coments incorporate responses 
 
                     to other comments on the code.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">You are right that we did not have specific 
 
                     mention of maintenance in the Code but the committee viewed 
 
                     maintance as another type of development, another way in which 
 
                     systems evolve. We believe modification of software requires 
 
                     the same care and responsiblity as does the original development 
 
                     of the software.. As you know, many forms of maintenance invlove 
 
                     the development of new subsystems and significant regression 
 
                     testing. We are also aware of the unfortunate circumstance 
 
                     where some developer treat maintenance as a mindless exercise. 
 
                     A Code need to be aspirational. If we are to achieve a minimum 
 
                     accepatable standard from all professionals and that this 
 
                     will also differentiate professionals from opportunists.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In our effort to emphasize the improtance 
 
                     of maintenance by applying the same standards of professional 
 
                     responsibility as new development we failed to explicitly 
 
                     mention the relation. We are adding a specific statement that 
 
                     will make clear that the term development includes new develpment, 
 
                     enhancement of existing system and correction of existing 
 
                     system. Target sentence. &#8220;One of the unique features 
 
                     of SE is maliability of already developed systems. This feature 
 
                     of software systems places special burdens on the software 
 
                     engineer to treat software modification with the same professionalism 
 
                     as new development.&#8221; </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In case this statement is missed, we have 
 
                     specifically added references to maintenance in the following 
 
                     places: preamble: &quot;Those who contribute, by direct participation 
 
                     or by teaching, to the design, development, and maintenance 
 
                     of software systems have significant opportunities both to 
 
                     do good and to cause harm and to influence and enable others 
 
                     to do good or cause harm. &quot;.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">&quot; To assure, as much as possible, that 
 
                     this power will be used for good, software engineers must 
 
                     commit themselves to making the design, development and maintenance 
 
                     of software a beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance 
 
                     with that commitment, software engineers shall adhere to the 
 
                     following Code of ethics.&quot;</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">&quot;8.01. Further their knowledge of developments 
 
                     in the design, development, maintenance and testing of software 
 
                     and related documents, together with the management of the 
 
                     development process&quot;</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Even under pressure the professional must 
 
                     understand the needed change, design the change, impelement 
 
                     and test the change and make sure that the change had no unexpected 
 
                     side effects. You are right that sometimes maintanance is 
 
                     treated as second class development and people take the dangerous 
 
                     step of modifying code they do not understand. One of the 
 
                     functions of a code of ethics is to provide standards of practice 
 
                     that people should aspire toward so we did not feel that this 
 
                     approach to software maintenance should be suported or advocated 
 
                     in a code of Good practice.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">We have added to bullet 1.01 1.01. Ensure 
 
                     that specifications for software on which they work have been 
 
                     well documented, satisfy the user&#8217;s requirements, and 
 
                     have the client&#8217;s approval. 1.02 Ensure that not work-

                     in that a large percentage of the development process is spent 
 
                     modifying </p>
 
                   <p align="center">=======================</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Some fixes are mechanical.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Your comment 2) about &#8220;shrinkwrapped 
 
                     software&#8221;development for the market, rather than development 
 
                     for a specific client was right on the mark. The development 
 
                     process is different here because the developer him/herself 
 
                     becomes the client. We are going to stipulate a &quot;client&quot; 
 
                     for shinkwrapped software: the person or persons who must 
 
                     be satisfied before the product is shipped. There is a concern 
 
                     that a shrinkwrapped client may agree to software that is 
 
                     damaging is some way to some users in the community. Those 
 
                     potnetially effected by this client acceptance need to be 
 
                     nformed. Development of systems with risks are unavoidable 
 
                     and acceptable, but ONLYwhen the affected parties are able 
 
                     to choose that risk. Disclaimers on such software would be 
 
                     required. Contractual bargains must be explicit. This also 
 
                     addresses your thid point about those who &#8220; &#8220;choose 
 
                     a niche in which their immediate goal is to produce a software 
 
                     product that is likely to be low quality but first on the 
 
                     market? &#8220; It is true that many companies trie to keep 
 
                     these levels of risk and low quality secret. But this behavior 
 
                     is viewed as unprofessional. Doctors perform operations which 
 
                     pose different degrees of threat to their patients but they 
 
                     must relveal the level of risk and secure informed consent.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> &#8220;This was the point of 1.14. Promote 
 
                     maximum quality and minimum cost to the employer, the client, 
 
                     the user and the public. Make any tradeoffs clear to all parties 
 
                     concerned.&#8221; We do understand that in any software development 
 
                     there will be trade-offs; but the professional is obliged 
 
                     to make these clear. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The next two points are straightforward to 
 
                     fix. Thank you. Point 4 is right on the mark. 6.15 is in need 
 
                     of clarification sharing &quot;useful software?related knowledge, 
 
                     inventions, or discoveries with the profession&quot;. A qualification 
 
                     is needed respecting rights of the third parties and confidentality. 
 
                     We are also adding a caveat about not violating or causing 
 
                     loss of trade secrets, competitive dis advantage etc. This 
 
                     will also cross reference 4.05</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Point 5 asks in regard to 1.15 &#8220;Are 
 
                     there reasonable and sufficient industry standards that apply 
 
                     to most or all areas of software engineering? &#8220; We struggled 
 
                     with this. We know there are different standards for data 
 
                     processing and real time systems. Unfortunately some developers 
 
                     generalize from the existence of different standards to &#8220;there 
 
                     are NO standards. We tried to cover this with the word &#8216; 
 
                     appropriate&#8217; in the introduction to this section. One 
 
                     of the things that make standards appropriate is the domain 
 
                     of application, shrinkwrap software etc. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">There is also the problem that there may 
 
                     be no best standard for a particular domain. &#8220; Work 
 
                     to follow industry standards that are most appropriate for 
 
                     the task at hand, departing from these only when technically 
 
                     justified.&#8221; will change to &#8220;Work to follow SUFFICIENT 
 
                     industry standards WHEN AVAILABLE that are most appropriate 
 
                     for the task at hand,...&#8221; We hope that &#8220;sufficient&#8221; 
 
                     implies that there are several acceptable methodologies and 
 
                     that &#8220;when available&#8221; allows for the fact that 
 
                     for certain projects there may be no best method.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Point 6 refers to the conflict of interest 
 
                     clause in 3.07 </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">You are correct in that we did intend the 
 
                     code to be read as whole and in the preamble suggested that 
 
                     individual items be read in the context of the code as a whole. 
 
                     We want to make clear We have decided to insert cross reference 
 
                     clauses where it is needed, rather than intreoduce more repetition 
 
                     into the Code.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> . Your concern with the absolute prohibitions 
 
                     of 3.07 was shared by others who commeted on the code. The 
 
                     intent of the conflict of interest clause was that potential 
 
                     conflicts of interest be revealed and addressed in ways acceptable 
 
                     to the customer. So we have deleted 3.07 and modified 3.06 
 
                     in the following way.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">3.06 Disclose to all concerned parties those 
 
                     potential conflicts of interest that cannot reasonably be 
 
                     avoided or escaped and aspire to resolve them. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">NEED INFORMED CONSENT WORD HERE I favor avoiding 
 
                     undisclosed potential conflicts. At the same time, expect 
 
                     professional behavior. [1i]I may participate. However, I must 
 
                     disclose the conflicts before participation and clearly state</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> Perhaps we might include soemthing about 
 
                     divulging interests and seeking agreement from affected parties

                     they have to cease their involvement. I think it is a case 
 
                     of transparency. The verb &quot;refuse&quot; is too strong. 
 
                     Also, restricting the statement to &quot;financial interest&quot; 
 
                     likely misses other important &quot;interests.&quot; A Software 
 
                     Engineer with an interest should fully disclose the nature 
 
                     of the interest. Based on the Software Engineer's belief that 
 
                     an unbiased opinion can be rendered and the comfort of the

                     participation of the Software Engineer in the decision process 
 
                     can be made and acted on accordingly. [10i] But 3.07 is simply
