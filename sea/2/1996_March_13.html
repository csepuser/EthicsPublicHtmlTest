       <p>Dear Working Group Members:<br>
   This is a LONG email message about SEEPP and our working group on Reliability
     and safety. Here is an outline of the message:<br>
   * BACKGROUND ON SEEPP <br>
    * OUR WORKING GROUP<br>
    * SOME RANDOM THOUGHTS<br>
    *HOMEWORK<br>
    *SCHEDULE</p>
       <p>===============================================================<br>
         * SOME BACKGROUND ON SEEP:<br>
         In October of 1994, the Joint IEEE Computer Society / ACM Project on
             Software Engineering: Ethical and Professional Standards of Practice
             published a call
       for participation. The purpose of SEEPP is given in that call: </p>
       <p>=============================================================</p>
       <p>The purpose
         of the SEEPP task force is to document the international consensus for
             minimally acceptable ethical/professional responsibilities and obligations
             of software
         engineers. <br>
         ----------------------<br>
         The scope is given as:</p>
       <p><br>
         1.0 SCOPE<br>
         (The standards to be established) shall document generally accepted
           principles for identifying and resolving ethical conflicts relevent
           to the discipline
           of software engineering. </p>
       <p>Consideration shall be given to the responsibilities
             and obligations of the Software Engineer to peers and laypersons,
         employer, customer (s), the profession and society/humanity. Additionally,
         consideration
             shall be similarly given to the obligations and responsibilities
         of these various entities towards the Software Engineer.</p>
       <p><br>
   1.1 GLOBAL APPLICATION<br>
   The SEEPP task force recognizes that the design, development and application
   of software often transcend national boundaries. We feel that it is vitally
   important that the global computing community have the means to insure that
   this project produces a product which is as reflective of the global computing
   community's wisdom as can be reasonably achieved. The participation of individuals
   from throughout the world is important to achieving this goal. </p>
       <p>These standards
     are intended to document the consensus of the global software engineering
         community. From time to time, consensus on an isue may not be clearly
         recognized. Accordingly, these standards shall also document various
         recommended practices and guidelines when no clear consensus can be established.</p>
       <p>==============================================<br>
 * OUR WORKING GROUP:<br>
 Later in the call, there was this description for our working group:<br>
 Reliability &amp; Safety<br>
 Chair: Keith Miller<br>
 miller@eagle.uis.edu<br>
 contracts, reliability thresholds in contracts, testing, risks, user centered
 design, truth in advertising, informed consent for buyers, financial support
 for improved quality, quantifying quality.</p>
       <p>===================================================<br>
         * SOME RANDOM THOUGHTS:<br>
         I want us to begin our work by brainstorming via email about what standards
           we can discover and articulate that have to do with reliability
           and safety.
   Here are a few random thoughts from me:<br>
       </p>
       <p>1. &quot;Reliability &amp; Safety&quot; may be too limiting. Parnas's
         term &quot;trustworthiness&quot; might improve the title of the working
         group. Other people might want &quot;testing&quot; or &quot;software
         quality assurance&quot; mentioned. Since we are talking about software
         engineering, I assume we will concentrate on software reliability and
         safety.<br>
       </p>
       <p>2. There is not a consensus on the state of the art in this field. That
         will complicate our task, but I don't think it makes it impossible. <br>
       </p>
       <p>3. I like the concept of &quot;informed consent&quot; in this area;
         we (generally) can't guarantee software success, but we can be candid
       about what we have done to assure a reasonable degree of success.</p>
       <p> Those
           three points are offered as conversation starters. There is a distinction
           that was described in the last task force meeting that also may inform
       our discussion. </p>
       <p>This paragraph was drafted by Don Gotterbarn: </p>
       <p>Most
             professions distinguish between standards of ethics, conduct, and
         practice. These
               standards include a range of statements, Standards of ethics are
           generally broad and aspirational and do not prescribe specific behaviors
           -prevent
               harm. Standards of conduct are more specific and standards of practice
               are regulative-do not release a product which has not been adequately
               tested. Violating this later type of standard is generally a foundation
               for legal action. These three types of standards exist for people
           as members of a profession, employees, and as individuals. We are looking
               for a range of statements and examples of these types of standards
         as they apply to professional competence.</p>
       <p>=====================================================<br>
         * HOMEWORK:<br>
         I. Please send email to me that describes YOUR view of possible standards
                 in the area of Software Reliability and Software Safety. We are
               brainstorming here, so don't be shy. Please aim these emails to
           ME, miller.keith@uis.edu,
           NOT at the whole group.</p>
       <p>
         II. Send email or paper mail to me of examples of ethics standards,
             standards of conduct, and standards of practice that you think are
             appropriate
             to our working group.
               These could come from professional organizations, from employers,
             from individuals, from scholarly literature, or from the popular
             press.</p>
       <p>
   III. I will sift through whatever you send, and I'll compile an email edited
     version for the whole group.</p>
       <p>===============================================<br>
         * SCHEDULE<br>
         APRIL 1: Deadline for group submitting materials to Keith. At this date
         I'll start editing the submitted stuff.<br>
   APRIL 15: Keith sends information back to the group, organized (I hope) around
   standards of ethics, standards of conduct, and standards of practice.<br>
   MAY 1: Additions and corrections sent back to Keith.<br>
   MAY 15: Keith sends back an edited document incorporating additions and corrections.<br>
   JUNE 1: Group responds to the latest version.<br>
   JUNE 15: Keith sends revised document to the general SEEPP Task Force members.<br>
   JULY 15 and beyond: Task Force combines working group documents, shapes them
   into a coherent package, and starts selling it to IEEE and ACM. </p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>The &quot;beyond&quot; includes
       more work for the working group, but we'll get into that later. I know
         the two-week rythym of this schedule sounds daunting, but we are eager
         to make
       progress after the painful delays we've experienced.<br>
