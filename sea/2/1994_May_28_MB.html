       <p>Meeting of the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS) and Association for Computing
         Machinery (ACM)<br>
 Joint Steering Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering as a Profession
       <p>Software Engineering Institute<br>
   Carnegie Mellon University<br>
   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania<br>
   Saturday, May 28, 1994<br>
   Participants:<br>
   Mario Barbacci, Barry Boehm, Doris Carver, Elliot Chikofsky, Pat Douglas, Larry
   Druffel,<br>
   Dennis Frailey, Don Gotterbarn, Sam Redwine (guest), John Werth, Stu Zweben<br>
   Regrets:<br>
   Fletcher Buckley, Robert Melford, Mary Shaw<br>
   Agenda Topics:<br>
   Welcome and Introductions<br>
   History of the initiative and initial recommendations<br>
   Task Force Report - body of knowledge and recommended practices<br>
   Task Force Report - ethics and professional practices<br>
   Task Force Report - curriculum<br>
   Discussion and recommendations<br>
   Wrap-up and review of action items<br>
   Software engineering body of knowledge and recommended practices<br>
   Pat Douglas - the methodology (task statement) adopted based on experience
   at IBM. Not assuming this is the end-all, just an initial step.<br>
 &#8226; Ideally would use a &quot;dictionary&quot; of terms but then it would
 be very difficult to identify body of knowledge through surveys.<br>
 &#8226; Have collected an initial list of major topics from several sources.<br>
 &#8226; Bloom's taxonomy is too detailed (6 levels); might chunk into just 3
 levels.</p>
       <p>Software engineering ethics and professional practices<br>
   Don Gotterbarn - all professions have a definition of &quot;obligation&quot; by
   virtue of belonging to a profession. Have identified several orthogonal axes
   for dealing with ethical issues:<br>
 &#8226; The groups to which we have ethical responsibility (the individual, the
 organization, the society)<br>
 &#8226; The standard ethics taxonomy (e.g., justice, equity, privacy and autonomy
 or beneficence, avoidance of harm, fidelity, and integrity)<br>
 &#8226; Ethical problems of software engineers (e.g., privacy, security, testing
 and reliabil<br>
   ity, competence, duties to society, intellectual property, and ethical tools)<br>
   The TF has taken the approach of using IEEE Standards process [actually, ANSI]
   to<br>
   define professional practices. ACM has a related process of standard concurrence.<br>
   Software engineering curriculum<br>
   Doris Carver and John Werth - The community knows how to develop curricula,
   the issues is how to gain acceptance and not let it become shelfware. Should
   not focus on &quot;software&quot; too soon but rather on &quot;engineering&quot;.
   Issues to consider include:<br>
 &#8226; How to involve the universities- How to reduce fears (e.g., fear of splitting
 MIS, CS, CE departments).<br>
 &#8226; Software engineering topics are moving into lower division curricula.<br>
 &#8226; Might be hard to invent yet another curriculum. The Steering Committee
 should think how do we sell this to academia. What are the leverage points e.g.:<br>
 &#8226; Accreditation boards<br>
 &#8226; Research agendas<br>
   Discussion<br>
   During the discussion there was a concern that mass surveys with lots of detailed/hard
   questions to lots of participants might be too cumbersome:<br>
 &#8226; How it is done in other disciplines- e.g., Medicine does it by defining
 surveys that are easy to pass.<br>
 &#8226; Address pieces of survey to groups of TC-SE/SIG SOFT members (we need
 to collect technical interest profiles)<br>
 &#8226; Separate questions<br>
 &#8226; What do you do-<br>
 &#8226; How do you do it-<br>
 &#8226; Identify fundamentals<br>
 &#8226; what did you learn in school and still use<br>
 &#8226; what did you learn and don't use The issue of U.S. vs. International
 definitions of the software engineering profession was addressed. Other countries
 have already defined certification/licensing for software engineers. Our strategy
 should be:<br>
 &#8226; 1-Will try to benefit from experience &amp; results in other countries<br>
 &#8226; 2-Definition is broad and can be used outside US.<br>
 &#8226; 3-Will study reciprocity with existing definitions in other countries<br>
       </p>
       <p>Questions and issues about the models:<br>
   How unique is the core to software engineering- We define the core but do it
     in context of applications (the core &quot;projects&quot; into applications
     areas) How much of the model is covered by the survey(s) Must involve educational
     community in definition of core<br>
   The scope of the committee<br>
   The steering committee felt that it was important to define the scope of the
   committee. The following topics were suggested:<br>
 &#8226; Statement of scope<br>
 &#8226; Mission/vision<br>
 &#8226; Goals<br>
 &#8226; Stakeholders<br>
 &#8226; Concept of Operation<br>
 &#8226; what does the profession look like (now and in the future)-<br>
 &#8226; how does committee operate-<br>
 &#8226; Control of profession when it is in place<br>
 &#8226; Funding for activity We only had time to cover the first item:<br>
   Draft mission statement:<br>
   `To establish the appropriate sets(s) of standards for professional practice
   of software engineering upon which industrial decisions, professional certification,
   and educational curricula can be based.&quot; There was some discussion about
   the appropriateness of the word &quot;standard&quot;; this is to be resolved
   by email discussion.<br>
   Stakeholders:<br>
 &#8226; Educational community<br>
 &#8226; universities<br>
 &#8226; community colleges<br>
 &#8226; students<br>
 &#8226; Professional societies<br>
 &#8226; Industry<br>
 &#8226; future employer<br>
 &#8226; human resources<br>
 &#8226; developer of products<br>
 &#8226; legal<br>
 &#8226; Practitioners<br>
 &#8226; Public users<br>
 &#8226; others<br>
 &#8226; Governments (federal, state)<br>
   Other providers of bodies of knowledge in SE<br>
   What is the target audience?<br>
   The target are those individuals engaged in professional practices - the middle
   layer in the following model of the future software market:<br>
   User Programming (100 million people in the US)<br>
   Application Application System Integrators<br>
   Generators (0.2 M) Composition (2 M) (2 million)<br>
   <br>
   Infrastructure (1 million)<br>
   <br>
   00. Academics Foundation Infrastructure (0.01 million)</p>
       <p>Resolutions<br>
 &#8226; Continue work of TF on body of knowledge and TF on ethics with appropriate
 changes as recommended during meeting.<br>
 &#8226; Task Force on curricula must define mission and role of educational community.<br>
   Action Items<br>

 of committee reports<br>

 &#8226; [Pat and Elliot] Define broad categories of audience interest for future
 surveys<br>
 &#8226; Solicit input from TCSE and SIGSOFT<br>
 &#8226; collect TSE and SIGSOFT member's profiles (for target surveys)<br>
 &#8226; [Mario and Stu] Steer draft press release from TF on Ethics and Professional
 Practices through CS/ACM for release at House briefing on June 21.<br>
