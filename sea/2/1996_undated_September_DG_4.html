       <p>DEAR EC(executive committee)- 
       
       <p> Below is a copy of the code with comments integrated. DF is Dennis
         Frailey (ACM chair of steering committee) and MS is Mary Shaw( member
         of steering committee). They received a copy of the code sent by Ed Mechler,
         who responded to Dennis' and Mary's early comments. Both The challenges
         and the comments have been circulated t the steering committee. Other
         comments are from members of the task force.</p>
       <p>Some of the comments raise difficulty, in that they are based on a miss-reading
         of the code or as in the case of &quot; bribery as good international
         business practices&quot; just plain wrong. </p>
       <p>Some of Simon's early comments are included. &gt;sr&gt;.. </p>
       <p>Keith, some second pass comments by Simon and I are listed under &gt;DS&gt;</p>
       <p>TASKS FOR US- </p>
       <p>relatively quickly is to restructure the code- a. to improve it b. to
         address objections raised. c. put together changes suggested with reasons
         for each and circulate to the task force</p>
       <p>Under a. I suggest at least the following:</p>
       <blockquote>
         <p> A.preamble introduction.</p>
         <blockquote>
           <p> i. revision of the introduction to include what we consider main
             functions of code </p>
           <p>ii. indication that code is not a list, black letter law, as in
             BCS code-put in preamble</p>
           <p> iii. make clear structure based on relationships </p>
           <p>iv make clear that client &amp; employer may not be synonymous,
             may even mean professor and student. </p>
           <p>v. include all people related to SE, like academics </p>
           <p>vi, YOUR ADDITIONS OR DELETION FROM THIS LIST</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p> B. bigger issues </p>
         <blockquote>
           <p>i. need to clearly bring QUALITY into the code-maybe in places that
             mention efficiency, for example 1.13 replace &quot;productivity&quot; with &quot;quality&quot; </p>
           <p>ii need to bring in teamwork and management issues </p>
           <p>iii. a professional owes higher order level of care </p>
           <p>iv. relate all stakeholders not merely &quot;end users&quot;</p>
           <p> v. address &quot;intensity issue&quot; by replacing &quot;assure&quot; with
             different terms </p>
           <p>vi. YOUR ADDITIONS DELETIONS FROM THIS LIST </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>C. minutia </p>
         <blockquote>
           <p>i. change &quot;RULES&quot; to &quot;PRINCIPLES&quot; </p>
           <p>ii. will we interleave examples 1.1,1.2 into list of principles,
             NSPE model or make the examples a separate list of guidelines ACM
             model. </p>
           <p>iii. YOUR additions or deletions from this list</p>
         </blockquote>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Under B</p>
       <blockquote>
         <p> A . clarity in structure will remove some objections, because some
           rules are for one type of relationship and not others, eg. MS argument
           that have to cite text books. </p>
         <p>B Need help here. </p>

         <p align="center"> <strong>CODE OF ETHICS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS v1.0
             September 1996 </strong></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p align="left">&gt;df&gt; In general, I think this expresses some good
         ideals, but is entirely impractical in a number of cases. The problem
         is that many of the things being proposed are vaguely defined, impossible
         to accomplish, or not under the control of the software engineer. A few
         others might not be generally accepted as the &quot;right&quot; thing
         to do.</p>
       <p align="left">&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; First The SE Code of Ethics was built
         using other professional codes as models. Ethics doesn't have a practical/impractical
         side that I have ever experienced. Usually, ethics are vaguely defined
         and are not under any one groups control. I don't think that any of the
         items are impossible to do as a professional. Finally, I'll give 100
         to 1 odds that under any professional code there are items that some
         will think are not the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.</p>
       <p align="left"> &gt;ms&gt; I share Dennis's general concern that this
         is fine in theory but hard to apply. I realize that codes of ethics should
         be idealistic, but they also must be credible ?? that is, practitioners
         should be able to see how the code shapes their work. Another way of
         saying this is &gt;that this draft seems a little naive.</p>
       <p align="left"> &gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; If I remember correctly, there was
         a debate in Ethics between Absolute and Relative but not idealistic and
         practical. The code doesn't shape work but guides SEs in areas of concern.
         I don't understand the &quot;naive&quot;, aren't we advocating all of
         the items in the code? </p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; The Code doesn't discriminate in intensity, even though some
         of the points are pretty close to absolute and others are currently viewed
         by many as good practice. I'd sign up to expecting an SE to refuse to
         work on a project that is blatantly unsafe or fraudulent. However, deviations
         from this committee's view of good process doesn't fall in this category,
         and the Code doesn't distinguish. For example, for me &quot;thou?shalt?absolutely&quot;s
         include 2.01, 2.03 (but see note), 2.07, 4.04,4.08, 4.09 whereas &quot;you
         should make a good?faith attempt to&quot; include 1.01, 1.05, 4.06, 5.06,
         5.11. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; I have never seen intensity associated with Ethics;
         guidelines are statements to help judgment. If a project is &quot;blatantly&quot; something
         then I don't need a code; the code is for the gray areas. </p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; There are some other points that require each software engineer
         to control things over which he/she has no control. Naturally the SE
         should try to achieve all this, by working within the company if not
         directly. But holding individual SEs responsible for things outside their
         control is another place where the degree of responsibility and consequence
         isn't clear: 1.01, 1.06, 1.07, 1.09, 1.12, 3.04, 4.02,6.06, 6.10 </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; The question is, Where does the responsibility begin?
         It must start at the SE Professional. I think too much &quot;Thou shall
         not&quot; or Thou shall&quot; is being read into the Codes Items. They
         are guide lines. </p>
       <p> &gt;ms&gt; &gt;There are some points at which mechanism creeps in.
         The Code should, I think, state the objective and leave implementation
         to the best judgement of the engineer. (This is the usual rule about
         specifications.)</p>
       <p> Examples: 1.01 (the new one about written specs, added between Aug
         8 and Sep 30), 2.02 (the &quot;well?documented&quot; part), 2.03 (the &quot;affix
         signature&quot; part), 5.13, 6.02 (the only way I can understand this
         one is as an implementation of something I haven't figured out yet).</p>
       <p> &gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not see the &quot;mechanism&quot;. We did not
         lay out steps but areas that the SE should be aware of. We tried to put
         them in a SE logical order which might give it an allusion of steps.
         The items are not objectives but guidelines for judgments.</p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; A particular problem area is international business. Even
         if the Code is intended for US practice, many US firms operate internationally.
         3.02 and 3.03 (on bribes, kickbacks, etc) don't really address the very
         gray situation in some countries. For example, I understand that in some
         countries customs officials are not supposed to take payments (by whatever
         name), but the computation that yields their salaries assumes they *are*
         receiving such payments. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; This is an area that goes back to Ethics being absolute
         or relative. I personally have not heard of a system using bribes, kickbacks,
         etc. that has worked. I have heard of systems that removed them and had
         better results. Anyway, this area was adapted from the PE Code, most
         of those people do business internationally.</p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; There are also omissions in the handling of intellectual
         property. Piracy appears in 4.04, confidentiality and public domain IP
         are used inconsistently in 4.05, copyright but not patent appears as
         part of a list in 4.07, trade secret and nondisclosure are mentioned
         nowhere at all (though 4.05 was probably intended to address them), there's
         also nothing about export restriction, and what's there about privacy
         is politically loaded. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Patent&quot; will be added to 4.07. If &quot;export
         restriction&quot; is desirable please write the statement and where it
         should be placed; I am not sure it fits here. As for privacy being politically
         loaded, maybe, but from an ethical point of view we should be very aware
         of these conditions.</p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; On the whole, I think the document would be more likely to
         be read if it were shorter, crisper, and more realistic. A supplementary
         document could work through examples in a little more detail than the
         2?liners that constitute most of this document. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; This a matter of style. We decided on the PE Code
         model to list some of the detail items associated with a rule.</p>
       <p align="center"> <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
       <p>Computers now have a central and growing role in commerce, industry,
         government, medicine, entertainment, and ordinary life. Because the utility
         of computers depends in large part on the instructions written for them,
         those who design, develop, and test software have enormous opportunities
         both to do good and to cause harm. To assure, as much as possible, that
         this power will be used for good, software engineers commit themselves
         to making the design, development, and</p>
       <p> &gt;pp&gt; must or shall commit themselves testing of software a distinct,
         beneficial, and respected profession. In accordance with that commitment,
         software engineers shall adhere to the following standards of conduct.
         The seven main paragraphs state general rules. Each subsidiary clause
         is a specific application of its general rule, one experience has shown
         needs express statement; but no set of subsidiary clauses exhausts the
         general rule.</p>
       <p>&gt;df The previous sentence makes no sense to me: </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; General disclaimer saying we cannot give all
         instances of a rule in ethics.</p>
       <p align="center"> <strong>Rule 1: PRODUCT</strong></p>
       <p> Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, assure that the software
         on which they work is useful to public, employer, customer, and user,
         completed on time and at reasonable cost, and free of significant error.
         In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate: </p>
       <p>&gt;sr&gt; who decides significant? </p>
       <p>&gt;dl&gt; General: I'm not sure that 'assure' is the right word; would
         'ensure' maybe be better? [eg. Rule 1 ? '... insofar as possible, assure
         that the software..' '... insofar as possible, ensure that the software..']</p>
       <p>&gt;mf&gt; Add: Assure use of approved standard practices.</p>
       <p> 1.01. Assure that specifications for software on which they work have
         been put in writing, satisfy the user's requirements, and have the customer's
         approval. </p>
       <p>&gt;df &gt; I see no reason why the ETHICS would require that specifications
         be put in writing. And I do not believe a software engineer is in a position
         to assure that specifications have met the other criteria. Examples:?
         you are brought in to fix something where you have(no) know knowledge
         of the history of its requirements you are given the requirements by
         your organization and have no interface with the customer and do not
         know if the customer has approved </p>
       <p>&gt;ed &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Specs in writing could be put &quot;record specs&quot; but
         at present writing is the safest way of assuring transfer of data. The
         example given is one of the problems we are trying to decrease the occurrence
         of. </p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 1.01....... put in writing. CHANGE TO 'documented'. This
         covers all electronic documentation too. </p>
       <p>&gt;DS&gt; replace put in writing with document</p>
       <p> 1.02. Assure that they understand fully the specifications for software
         on which they work. </p>
       <p> &gt;df&gt;&gt;Would that this were true. It never is in practice. Things
         are gray here. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, as professionals, another area we are trying
         to decrease the occurrence of. Shouldn't we strive for better specs and
         be unethical if we didn't.</p>
       <p> 1.03. Assure that they are qualified, by education and experience,
         for any project on which they work.</p>
       <p>&gt;dl&gt; Rule 1.03 'Assure that they are qualified, by education and
         experience, for any project on which they work [or propose to work]</p>
       <p> 1.04. Assure proper goals and objectives for any project on which they
         work.</p>
       <p> &gt;df&gt;&gt;How can this be done? What is &quot;proper&quot;? By
         whose standards?</p>
       <p> &gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; There seems to be a contradiction here ? if standards,
         companys/industry, exist then &quot;proper&quot; is defined. These are
         not difficult to do, although we don't, if we follow project manage techniques.</p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; &gt;-? 1.04: Who on earth gets to decide whether goals are &quot;proper&quot;? &gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; Ethics
         is a set of principles or values that guide our judgments.</p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; General comment: Change proper to 'approved'. Proper is too
         qualitative.</p>
       <p> 1.05. Assure proper development methodology on any project on which
         they work. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt;&gt;Same question as above. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; See 1.04</p>
       <p>&gt;mf&gt; Clauses 1.05 and 1.14 should be combined. Clause 1.14 seems
         to be a special case of 1.05.</p>
       <p> 1.06. Assure proper management on any project on which they work, including
         proper procedures for control of quality and risk.</p>
       <p> &gt;df&gt;&gt; This is patently impossible. A software engineer is
         not in a position to assure anything about management unless they are
         the management. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; As any type of engineer I can assure proper mgmt
         of my responsible areas and shouldn't I report mismgmt.</p>
       <p> 1.07. Assure proper estimates of cost, schedule, personnel, and outcome
         on any project on which they work. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt;&gt; Once again, what is &quot;proper&quot; and notwithstanding
         that, how can a software developer assure this in practice? Chances are
         they were added to the project long after estimates were done. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; Another area we are trying to decrease the occurrence
         of. </p>
       <p> 1.08. Assure adequate documentation on any project on which they work,
         including a log of problems discovered and solutions adopted. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt; This is determined by company processes and procedures and
         policies and specific customer requirmenets, not by software engineers
         desires. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; What is the problem? Why shouldn't a professional
         add to these in areas of their expertise?</p>
       <p> 1.09. Assure proper testing, debugging, and review of software and
         related documents on which they work.</p>
       <p> &gt;df&gt; What is &quot;proper&quot;? </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; See 1.04</p>
       <p> 1.10. Assure that software and related documents on which they work
         respect the privacy of those who will be subject to the software.</p>
       <p> &gt;df&gt; This is vague and untestable. Who will be &quot;subject
         to the software&quot;? What does it mean to &quot;respect the privacy&quot;? </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; This is an ethics statement not a program being written.
         I don't think it is vague but an assurance that the SE thinks about the
         privacy issue.</p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; &gt; -1.10: software/documentation seems mismatched to privacy.
         Privacy probably belongs under Rule 2 anyhow. Further, there's a big
         difference in the privacy arena between what's legal in the US and what
         many people think is &quot;proper&quot;. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a difference, something legal could be unethical.
         The items are guidelines for judgments. </p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 1.10 ....... respect the privacy... Change respect to 'maintain'.</p>
       <p> 1.11 Assure that raw information used in software is accurate, derives
         from a legitimate source, and is used only in ways properly authorized. </p>
       <p>&gt;sr&gt; change raw information to data and include &quot;only in
         ways properly authorized. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt; &gt;Assurance may be difficult. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; It may be difficult but we owe it to the public and
         who we are doing the job for.</p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 1.11........Change software is accurate.. to software 'development'
         is accurate..</p>
       <p> 1.12. Assure ethical, economic, cultural, legal, and environmental
         issues are properly identified, defined, and addressed. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt; Few software engineers even know what these issues are. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; Then maybe they are not SEs and this is a goal we
         should be aiming for.</p>
       <p> 1.13. Promote maximum productivity and minimum cost to employer, customer,
         user, and public.</p>
       <p> &gt;df&gt; &gt;A nice ideal. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; Is the commentator saying we are not doing this now?
         Are we a group of cheats? </p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; &gt; -1.13: What if the client wants quality of product (==&gt; not
         minimum price) and quality of life for SEs and programmers (==&gt; not
         maximum productivity)? </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; The client should then have a code or mission; I
         am not sure these fall under the SEs control. Anyway these do not seem
         to me to be mutually exclusive. </p>
       <p>&gt;DS&gt; replace productivity with QUALITY</p>
       <p>1.14. Avoid fads, departing from standard practices only when justified. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt; &gt;This is a judgement call. Highly inappropriate in a code
         of ethics. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; Ethics is a set of principles or values that guide
         our judgments.</p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; &gt; -1.14: It is not the case that &quot;fad&quot; is the
         same thing as &quot;departure from standard practice&quot;. In fact,
         there's a good case that some standard practices ARE fads. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; That is so true. A great deal of resources are applied
         because it is the latest fad , not because it fits the project and if
         we are luckily we end up where we started. As professionals this is an
         area we should be trying to decrease the occurrence of. </p>
       <p>&gt;dl&gt;Rule 1.14 'Avoid fads, departing from standard practices only
         when [technically] justified.</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>Rule 2: PUBLIC. Software engineers shall, in their professional role,
         act only in ways consistent with the public safety, health and welfare.
         In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
       <p> 2.01. Disclose to appropriate persons any danger that the software
         or related documents on which they work may pose to the user, a third
         party, or the environment. </p>
       <p>&gt;dl&gt; Rule 2.01 'Disclose to appropriate persons any [actual or
         potential] danger..'</p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 2.01.........Change persons to 'authorities'</p>
       <p> 2.02. Approve software only if they have a well?documented belief that
         it is safe, meets specifications, and has passed all appropriate tests. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt; This is too arbitrary. Why must their belief be well documented?
         Doesn't this depend on the intended use of the software? Doesn't &quot;safety&quot; also
         depend on the intended use? </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; Again 1.14 response; taken from PE Code. </p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 2.02.........Change appropriate to 'required'</p>
       <p> &gt;sr&gt; &quot;well documented belief&quot; don't know what this
         is </p>
       <p>&gt;DS&gt; &quot;well documented replace with well-founded</p>
       <p> 2.03. Affix their signature only to documents prepared under their
         supervision and within their areas of competence. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt; This would eliminate most documents one signs while seeking
         employment, such as non?disclosure agreements and various employment
         condition documents, such as intellectual property rights agreements. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; I do not see what these examples have to do with
         Rule 2. </p>
       <p>&gt;SR&gt; replace and with or </p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; &gt; -2.03 Presumably this means engineering documents about
         the product, not other documents the SE may sign at various times? </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes it refers to Rule 2</p>
       <p>&gt;mf&gt; Clause 2.03 might better fit under another rule, perhaps
         Rule 3?</p>
       <p> 2.04. Cooperate in efforts to correct problems in software or related
         documents. </p>
       <p>&gt;mf&gt; Clause 2.04 should be moved to Rule 1. </p>
       <p>2.05. Be fair and truthful in all public statements concerning software
         or related documents. </p>
       <p>&gt;dl&gt; Rule 2.05 'Be fair and truthful in [statements, particularly]
         in all public..']</p>
       <p> &gt;sr&gt; raises whistle blowing issue</p>
       <p> 2.06. Not put self?interest, the interest of an employer, or the interest
         of a client or customer ahead of the public's interest. </p>
       <p>&gt;sr&gt; who decides, client OR customer, used inconsistently with
         Principle 4 </p>
       <p>2.07. Accept full responsibility for their own work. </p>
       <p>&gt;ms&gt; 2.07 Wouldn't it be nice to have a level of practice that
         allowed this? </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; As professionals we should try hard to get there;
         we have too much finger pointing.</p>
       <p align="center"> <strong>Rule 3: JUDGMENT</strong></p>
       <p align="left">Software engineers shall, insofar as possible, protect
         both the independence of their professional judgment and their reputation
         for such judgment. In particular, software engineers shall, as appropriate:</p>
       <p align="left"> 3.01 Maintain professional skepticism with respect to
         any software or related documents they are asked to evaluate. </p>
       <p>3.02. Reject bribery. </p>

         business.</p>
       <p> &gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; See reply to international note.</p>
       <p> 3.03. Accept no payback, kickback, or other payment from a third party
         to a contract, except with the knowledge and consent of all parties to
         the contract. </p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 3.03.... Change no payback, to no 'lawful' payback</p>
       <p> 3.04. Accept payment from only one party for any particular project,
         or for services related to the same project, except when the circumstances
         have been fully disclosed to the parties concerned and they have given
         their informed consent.</p>
       <p> 3.05. Neither solicit nor accept a contract from a governmental body
         on which a principal or officer of their employer serves as a member.</p>
       <p>&gt;mf&gt; Clause 3.05 is too restrictive. As long as relationships
         and conflict of interest issues are addressed, there should be norestriction.</p>
       <p> 3.06. Participate in no decision of a governmental or professional
         body, as a member or advisor, concerned with software, or related documents,
         in which they, their employer, or their client have a financial interest.</p>
       <p> &gt;mf&gt; Clause 3.06 -Does this apply to participation in standards
         bodies?</p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 3.06 How does this relate to industrial consortia membership
         such as Unix Open, Semantec, etc.. ? </p>
       <p>&gt;DS&gt; Make 3.06 part of 307 and 306 to bring in issue of informed
         consent </p>
       <p>3.07. Disclose to all concerned parties those conflicts of interest
         that cannot reasonably be avoided or escaped. &gt;ms&gt; &gt; ? 3.05,
         3.06 Are these acts always and without exception unethical? I've been
         a member of a number of groups in which potential conflicts were managed
         other than by complete exclusion. Indeed, 3.07offers an alternative,
         thereby creating disagreement among 3.05, 3.06, and 3.07. &gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; I
         am not sure I understand your experiences but 3.05 and 3.06 give a guideline
         for these conditions and 3.07 gives an alternative if 3.05/3.06 can not
         be applied.</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>Rule 4: CLIENT AND EMPLOYER.<br>
       </strong> </p>
       <p> Software engineers shall, consistent with the public health, safety,

         trustees of their client or employer. </p>

       <p>In particular, software engineers shall:</p>
       <p> 4.01. Provide service only in areas of competence. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt; This would eliminate most practicing software engineers.
         I mean this. Who determines competence?</p>
       <p> &gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; The commentator paints a very bleak picture of our

         you agree with the first reviewer; The commentator paints a very bleak
         picture of our industry.</p>

         by someone qualified to approve it. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt; And how are they to determine the qualifications of the person
         who approved a document that was prepared by another organization or

         are many degrees of confidentiality to observe. In particular, copyright
         material is widely availablle in books but not public domain. Do you
         really mean an SE should say &quot;I found the algorithm in a standard
         textbook but must keep it confidential?&quot; That's what this point
         says. </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; First, I haven't seen a standard textbook in a while.
         Shouldn't it be the responsibility of the SE to bring your example to

         problem in the software or related documents on which they work. 4.07.
         Inform client or employer promptly if, in their opinion, a project is

       <p> &gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; We have 5.10. I have seen &quot;Obey all Laws&quot; in
         ethics documents but find it hard to put general legal factors in ethics

       <p>&gt;ms&gt; &gt; -6.02 Is it the intention of the Code to eliminate anonymous

         review engineering artifacts regularly. As far as I know, reviewers of
         public artifacts don't check in first. This would preclude product reviews
         undertaken without prior warning to the developer; it would impede product
         selection in the same way. What is this really trying to say? </p>
       <p>&gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; 6.02 is not even related to 5.13. Shouldn't a professional

       <p> 6.04. Criticize the work of others in an objective, candid, and properly?documented
         way.</p>
       <p> 6.05. Give a fair hearing to the opinion, concern, or complaint of
         a colleague.</p>
       <p> 6.06. Assure that employees are informed of standards before being
         held to them.</p>
       <p> 6.07. Assure co?workers know the employer's policies and procedures
         for protecting passwords, files, and other confidential information. </p>
       <p>&gt;mf&gt; Clause 6.07 ? This is a management function. </p>
       <p>&gt;sr&gt; add &quot;and security measures in general&quot; 6.08. Assign
         work only upon considerations of professional qualifications. </p>
       <p>&gt;dl&gt; Rule 6.08</p>
       <p> 'Assign work only upon considerations of professional qualifications
         [and experience.]</p>
       <p> 6.09. Provide for due process in hearing charges of violation of an
         employer's policy or of this code.</p>
       <p> &gt;mf&gt; Clauses 6.08, 6.09, and 6.14 are management functions. Does
         not fit well under this rule.</p>
       <p> 6.10. Develop a fair agreement concerning ownership of any invention
         an employee makes. </p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 6.10...... Change an employee... to 'anyone' &gt;sr&gt; this
         is limited to the context of employment </p>
       <p>6.11. Not supplant another software engineer after steps have been taken
         for employment. </p>
       <p>&gt;mf&gt; Clause 6.11 is not clear. What is issue? </p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 6.11 What does this mean?? </p>
       <p>&gt;sr&gt; -6.12. Attract employees only by full and accurate description
         of the conditions of employment. </p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 6.12 Change Attract employees to 'Recruit colleagues'</p>
       <p> 6.13. Offer only fair and just compensation. </p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 6.13 This does not seem to fit here. This is within the purview
         and responsibility of management or owners of the enterprise and not
         the SWEng individual contributor. </p>
       <p>&gt;sr&gt; for what? </p>
       <p>6.14. Not prevent a subordinate from taking a better job for which the
         subordinate is qualified.</p>
       <p> &gt;pp&gt; 6.14 I'm not sure what the intention of this statement was,
         however, it should be eliminated or restated, e.g. 'No software engineer
         shall interfere in the professional career progression of any colleague.'</p>
       <p align="center"> <strong>Rule 7: SELF</strong></p>
       <p> Software engineers shall, throughout their career, try to enhance their
         own ability to practice their profession as it should be practiced. In
         particular, software engineers shall continually endeavor to:</p>
       <p> 7.01. Improve their knowledge of recent developments in the design,
         development, and testing of software and related documents. </p>
       <p>&gt;df&gt;&gt; I don't see why this is required for them to be ethical.
         Ditto for the rest of this section. Sounds more like what one would expect
         for them to get a license, not to be considered ethical.</p>
       <p> &gt;ed&gt;&gt;&gt; In the fastest growing field today, and perhaps
         in history, this is definitely an ethical issue. I have met too many
         people giving advice and guidance who I hope were not up to date and
         not just lying </p>
       <p>&gt;mf&gt; Clause 7.01 ? Delete &quot;recent&quot;.</p>
       <p> 7.02. Improve their ability to create safe, reliable, and useful software
         at reasonable cost and within a reasonable time. </p>
       <p>&gt;pp&gt; 7.2 ...at reasonable cost and within reasonable time. This
         last part of the item is too qualitative and should be eliminated. We
         might consider changing the term reasonable to 'contractual' cost and
         schedule. This would at least allow or acknowledge redress in the civil
         contract's law process.</p>
       <p> 7.03. Improve their ability to write accurate, informative, and literate
         documents in support of software on which they work. </p>
       <p>7.04. Improve their understanding of the software and related documents
         on which they work and of the environment in which they will be used. </p>
       <p>7.05. Improve their knowledge of the law governing the software and
         related documents on which they work. </p>
       <p>7.06. Improve their knowledge of this code, its interpretation, and
         its application to their work.</p>
