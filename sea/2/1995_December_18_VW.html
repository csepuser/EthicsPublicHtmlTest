 When Chicago-based System Software Associates Inc. was sued recently by Owens-Illinois
 Inc. over business software the Toledo-based glass container manufacturer says
 doesn't work, it was just the latest of many cases plaguing one of America's
 hottest industries.<br>
                     <br>
 Companies such as SSA, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Germany's SAP Corp. (Systeme
 Anwendung Produkte AG) are leaders in a fast-growing $5 billion industry that
 provides new computing power to companies eager to create information systems
 that seamlessly link all business functions.<br>
                     <br>
 But many firms making the transition from outdated mainframe computer systems
 to powerful, more flexible client/server networks are hitting major potholes
 on the information superhighway.<br>
                     <br>
 In some cases, the computer systems and software simply have not lived up to
 manufacturers' promises. In others, the unrealistic expectations of corporate
 clients have vastly exceeded the new software's capabilities.<br>
                     <br>
 While the newer systems are supposed to allow employees worldwide to use personal
 computers to exchange everything from design and manufacturing data to financial
 and marketing e-mail, companies are discovering they don't always work that way.<br>
                     <br>
 The result has been an increasing number of squabbles between the industry's
 200 or so commercial software manufacturers and their customers.<br>
                     <br>
 For example, in addition to the dispute between $3.7 billion Owens-Illinois and
 SSA, Siemens Medical Systems Inc. filed suit in July against Newton, Mass.- based
 Marcam Corp., alleging the company's MXP business process software failed to
 perform as promised.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;It was driving us crazy,&quot; said a Siemens employee familiar with the
 problem. We needed to make some changes in the software to make it work for us
 and we just couldn't do it. And neither could Marcam. It added up to hundreds
 of hours of downtime. People were pulling their hair out.&quot;<br>
                     <br>
 Because litigation is ongoing, neither Siemens nor Marcam would speak in specifics
 or on the record, but a Marcam official said the problem arose from unworkable
 modifications Siemens made to the software.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;They were trying to get it to work a certain way on their old system and
 it wouldn't &quot; said a Marcam representative.<br>
                     <br>
 Atlanta-based American Software Inc. has been sued by GTE Corp., with the $19.9
 billion telecommunications giant charging that American's product didn't perform
 the way GTE had been told it would. With the case settled out of court, both
 parties are bound by a confidentiality agreement.<br>
                     <br>
 But a GTE employee close to the dispute said the promise of seamless computer
 communication on the information superhighway between the company's 111,000
 worldwide employees turned into &quot;an interchange from hell.&quot;<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;E-mail got lost in cyberspace and numbers crunching across the enterprise
 turned into teeth gnashing,&quot; said a GTE employee.<br>
                     <br>
 The dispute between American Software and GTE, like most such scuffles, was
 resolved through extensive after-service tweaking of the product. Like most,
 it was never made public.<br>
                     <br>
 It was the same story with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the nation's largest<br>
 publicly owned electric and natural gas utility. It ordered a multimillion- dollar
 system from SAP Corp.--the General Motors of the commercial, application-oriented
 software industry.<br>
                     <br>
 When the product failed to handle the Northern California company's complex accounting
 system the way PG&amp;E had been told it would, it called SAP and demanded something
 be done.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;SAP wound up sending in a team but they had no idea how to deal with PG&amp;E's
 complex accounting system,&quot; said Bill McSpadden, an analyst with Boston-based
 Plantwide Research Group. &quot;So PG&amp;E wound up training SAP's accounting
 experts in its unique accounting methods so they could properly install the system.&quot;<br>
                     <br>
 PG&amp;E representative Leonard Anderson said the company is still in the early
 stages of installing and configuring SAP's system. The company estimates all
 the bugs should be worked out by April 1996.<br>
                     <br>
 Bruce Richardson, an analyst with Boston-based AMR, says while it's not unusual
 for software companies to be threatened with lawsuits, it is unusual that such
 cases make headlines. Most problems are solved through negotiation, modification
 and fine tuning, he said.<br>
                     <br>
 But as more and more companies buy new computer systems and technologies
 costing anywhere from a few hundred thousand dollars to $15 million to $20 million,
 or more, lawsuits against software companies are likely to increase. So is the
 publicity surrounding them.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;Our industry is guilty of downplaying the difficulties in making the transition
 from current computer systems to these new client/server systems,&quot; said
 Richardson. &quot;Information systems people at corporations get enamored with
 the technology. But for many customers it quickly becomes more complicated than
 they ever dreamed it could be. This is not plug and play stuff.&quot;<br>
                     <br>
 While neither side is saying very much on the record, that seems to be what happened
 between Owens-Illinois and SSA, analysts say.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;Owens-Illinois says SSA guaranteed that the BPCS (Business Planning and
 Control Software) system it makes would run on the company's Unix-based Sybase
 Inc. relational database system by a certain date,&quot; said Bill McSpadden,
 an analyst with Boston-based Plantwide Research Group. &quot;When that didn't
 happen, they sued. SSA apparently ran into all kinds of technical problems.&quot;<br>
                     <br>
 Among other things, Owens-Illinois charged in its suit that the $11 million SSA<br>
 software system would not generate consolidated reports at all levels; would
 not integrate with fax and e-mail software to send forms and reports; and would
 not perform date and time stamp processing on all system records.<br>
                     <br>
 The suit claims SSA consistently misrepresented the software's capabilities and
 failed to deliver a Unix-based Sybase version by November 1994, as promised.
 SSA's BPCS software runs on databases made by Informix Corp. and Oracle Corp.,
 but the company is working on a Unix-based Sybase version.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;Using the product SSA gave us was like trying to park a Rolls-Royce in
 a dog house,&quot; said an Owens-Illinois representative. &quot;It just wouldn't
 fit. So we had to build around it. We changed some of our business practices.
 But that took time and we needed a new system yesterday.&quot;<br>
                     <br>
 SSA's software, already being used by some 7,500 clients worldwide, is designed
 to link thousands of company computers with a common graphical interface and
 a shared set of object-oriented programming languages.<br>
                     <br>
 Roger Covey, SSA's founder and chief executive, insists there is nothing wrong
 with SSA's software or with the plan it had for getting it up and running at
 Owens-Illinois.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;At Owens-Illinois we were in middle of a plan to implement our BPCS software,&quot; said
 Covey, whose 14-year-old company had sales of $267 million through the first
 nine months of 1995. &quot;We had eight people in place there. We didn't think
 anything was wrong with the software. We still don't. But at the same time, this
 is not like installing Windows 95 on a personal computer.&quot;<br>
                     <br>
 In the meantime, Owens-Illinois has contracted with Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software<br>
 to provide its &quot;SmartStream&quot; client/server system that will operate
 with the Unix-based database it already has in place.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;The problem is that companies are often asked to change the way they do
 business to fit the new information system,&quot; said Michael Soenen, a founder
 and executive vice president of Waterstone Consulting in Palatine--a 1993 spin-off
 of Andersen Consulting. &quot;That's not the way it should be.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;Software companies slide into the sales mode and when a client asks if
 a product can do this or that, their sales people say `Oh yeah, we can support
 that,' &quot; said Soenen, whose company designs and integrates information systems
 for clients. &quot;What's happening is that the corporations aren't doing their
 due diligence and the manufacturers are developing a system one way while the
 client is expecting something else.&quot;<br>
                     <br>
 Companies like Owens-Illinois are not unusual in changing the way they do business
 to fit computer hardware and software systems.<br>
                     <br>
 Instron Corp., a Canton, Mass. manufacturer of materials testing equipment, shelled
 out millions of dollars for a mainframe system in the 1980s that was partially
 replaced with a hodgepodge of personal computers and an archaic bookkeeping system
 in which serial numbers of components are still entered into a ledger by hand.<br>
                     <br>
 Two years ago, the $136 million company finally decided it had to do something.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;Over the next few months all of our mainframes will be unplugged,&quot; said
 Mark 
 C. Montlack, manager of manufacturing systems. In their place, the company is
 installing a multimillion-dollar Unix-based client/server system sold by Interactive
 Inc., of San Diego.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;The new system has its warts and blemishes,&quot; said Montlack. &quot;It
 doesn't do everything we want it to yet. For example, we're still using that
 old ledger book.&quot;<br>
                     <br>
 Still, Montlack says the new system is saving Instron lots of money--&quot;seven
 digits a year&quot; in reduced work hours and other inefficiencies.<br>
                     <br>
 &quot;But the big question is what will be the actual costs of the system because
 of all the software enhancements and the upgraded hardware that was not originally
 budgeted?&quot; Montlack said. &quot;It's been my experience that you should
 consider yourself real lucky if you find a system that is able to do 70 to 80
 percent of what you need.&quot;
