                   <div align="justify">version 2.1<br>
 
                     Mario, </div>
 
                   <p align="justify">The draft I sent the Steering committee 2.0a 
 
                     had several spelling errors and had highlighted changes with 
 
                     capitalization. It does no good to circulate the code in that 
 
                     form. Below is version 2.1- just like 2.0a only with spelling 
 
                     corrected and highlighting of changes removed. Please only 
 
                     circulate version 2.1</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The way I understood the steering committee 
 
                     minutes was that the draft code cannot be circulated without 
 
                     an officially sanctioned cover memo. Below is the draft code 
 
                     version 2.1 and an introduction which I believe serves the 
 
                     purpose of a cover memo. It strikes me as a better to present 
 
                     a single coherent document. I made this suggestion to Stu, 
 
                     but have not heard anything back yet. Is there a any chance 
 
                     of meeting the Monday deadline for SIGCAS?(See my note to 
 
                     Stu below.)</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">According to the minutes of the steering 
 
                     committee, the draft code can only be distributed in an identical 
 
                     form on all media, so we cannot move foreward until steering 
 
                     committee approval is received for my suggestion below.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In terms of where to put this on the web,
                     
 
                     I would rather have responses to the draft code and not have
                     
 
                     commentators engaging in acrimonious debates with each other.
                     People seem to feel are less reticent 
 
                     to express their views about morals in a private setting.
                     
 
                     I realize that this is more work for us, but we managed to
                     
 
                     handle this kind of email when we did the ACM code of ethics. 
 
                   </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">What is the planed location at the IEEE site 
 
                     so I can be more specific in the article below.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">I really appreciate the promptness of your 
 
                     responses. It is fun to work on a project that is moving along. 
 
                     Thanks.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">best regards, don</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">ps I will get the addresses, email, and fax 
 
                     information for the executvie committee awardees to you shortly.<br>
 
                     ==================Here is what I sent to Stu ============</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Three items.<br>
 
                     First the &quot;cover memo&quot;<br>
 
                     I am not sure what the steering committee had in mind, but 
 
                     I thought rather than doing a &quot;cover memo&quot; a cohesive 
 
                     document with an introduction and the code would work better. 
 
                     To that end I have done the following: I wrote an article 
 
                     about the entire project in a book &quot;The Responsible Software 
 
                     Engineer&quot;. The article was based on note supplied by 
 
                     the steering committee when Mario was chair and the article 
 
                     was approved by the steering committee. I have abstracted 
 
                     from that article a statement of the background for my task 
 
                     force. This abstract is the first two paragraphs of the document 
 
                     below. This is followed by a paragraph stating that this is 
 
                     a draft code and soliciting comments. Then comes the code 
 
                     followed by contact information. It would help if we could 
 
                     say where at each web site this will be found. Abstracting 
 
                     from an already published document should make the committee 
 
                     approval process easier.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">What do you think about this approach?</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Second<br>
 
                     I have not heard back from SIGSOFT yet, but the editor at 
 
                     SIGCAS has already delayed two weeks and was told by the publisher 
 
                     that the final copy must be fed exed by Monday afternoon. 
 
                     If we don't make that deadline, the draft will not appear 
 
                     until September.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Third I am a version freak. You will note 
 
                     that this code is listed as version 2.1 rather than 2.a The 
 
                     differences between this version and what I sent to the steering 
 
                     committee earlier in the week is: the spelling in the preamble 
 
                     has been corrected, a possessive apostrophe as removed from 
 
                     the word &quot; opinion's&quot; because it is a plural not 
 
                     a possessive and the capitalization used to highlight the 
 
                     changes was removed. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Let me know what you think of this.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Thanks for your interest and help.</p>

                     =================================== </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Software Engineering Ethics Code<br>
 
                     Don gotterbarn, Keith Miller, Simon Rogerson </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">In May of 1993, the Board of Governors of 
 
                     the IEEE-CS established a steering committee for evaluating, 
 
                     planning, and coordinating actions related to establishing 
 
                     software engineering as a profession. In that same year the 
 
                     ACM Council endorsed the establishment of a Commission on 
 
                     Software Engineering. By January of 1994, both societies formed 
 
                     a joint committee &quot;To establish the appropriate set(s) 
 
                     of standards for professional practice of Software Engineering 
 
                     upon which industrial decisions, professional certification, 
 
                     and educational curricula can be based.&quot; To accomplish 
 
                     these tasks they made the following recommendations:</p>
 
                   <p align="justify"> 1. adopt standard definitions,<br>
 
                     2. define required body of knowledge and recommended practices<br>
 
                     3. define ethical standards<br>
 
                     4. define educational curricula for undergraduate, graduate(MS) 
 
                     and continuing education (for retraining and migration).</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The steering committee decided to accomplish 
 
                     these tasks through the establishment of a series of task 
 
                     forces. Initially the task forces established were: Software 
 
                     Engineering body of knowledge and recommended practices; Software 
 
                     Engineering ethics and professional practices, and Software 
 
                     Engineering curriculum. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The purpose of the ethics task force is to 
 
                     document the ethical and professional responsibilities and 
 
                     obligations of software engineers. This draft code of ethics 
 
                     was developed by a task force of the Joint IEEE Computer Society 
 
                     and Association for Computing Machinery Steering Committee 
 
                     for the Establishment of Software Engineering as a Profession. 
 
                     The task force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional 
 
                     Practices developed this code for a sub-specialization within 
 
                     the constituencies of both of the professional societies. 
 
                     In an attempt to reflect the international character of both 
 
                     organizations and the profession itself, the composition of 
 
                     the task force is multinational in both citizenship and in 
 
                     membership in professional computing organizations. The proposed 
 
                     draft Code of Ethics for Software Engineers ( version 2.1 
 
                     ) was developed by the task force and reviewed by the Steering 
 
                     Committee for distribution and comment as a preliminary draft. 
 
                     The intent of this distribution is to solicit comments from 
 
                     practitioners and other interested parties.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Based on the feedback from readers of this 
 
                     publication and from other sources, a final draft of the code 
 
                     will be developed and presented to the Steering Committee 
 
                     for approval. <br>

                   <p align="justify"> DRAFT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CODE OF ETHICS 
 
                     <br>
 
                     version 2.1 April 1997</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">PREAMBLE v 2.1 </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Computers now have a central and growing 
 
                     role in commerce, industry, government, medicine, education, 
 
                     entertainment, social affairs, and ordinary life. Those who 
 
                     contribute, by direct participation or by teaching, to the 
 
                     design and development of software systems have significant 
 
                     opportunities both to do good and to cause harm and to influence 
 
                     and enable others to do good or cause harm. To assure, as 
 
                     much as possible, that this power will be used for good, software 
 
                     engineers must commit themselves to making the design and 
 
                     development of software a beneficial, and respected profession. 
 
                     In accordance with that commitment, software engineers shall 
 
                     adhere to the following code of ethics. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The code contains eight keyword principles 
 
                     related to the behavior of and decisions made by professional 
 
                     software engineers, be they practitioners, educators, managers 
 
                     and supervisors, or policy makers, as well as trainees and 
 
                     students of the profession. The Principles identify the various 
 
                     relationships in which individuals, groups, and organizations 
 
                     participate and the primary obligations within these relationships. 
 
                     . Each principle of this code addresses three levels of ethical 
 
                     obligation owed by professional software engineers in each 
 
                     of these relationships. The first level identified is a set 
 
                     of ethical values which they share with all other human beings 
 
                     by virtue of their humanity. The second level obliges professionals 
 
                     to a higher order of care for those who may be affected by 
 
                     their work. The third and deeper level comprises several obligations 
 
                     which derive directly from elements unique to the professional 
 
                     practice of software engineering. The clauses of each principle 
 
                     are illustrations of the various levels of obligation included 
 
                     in that relationship.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The clauses under each Principle consist 
 
                     of three different types of statement corresponding to each 
 
                     level. Level One: Aspire (to be human); Statements of aspiration 
 
                     provide vision and objectives, are intended to direct professional 
 
                     behavior. These directives require significant ethical judgement. 
 
                     Level Two: Expect (to be professional); Statements of expectation 
 
                     express the obligations of all professionals and professional 
 
                     attitudes. Again they do not describe the specific behavior 
 
                     details but they clearly indicate professional responsibilities 
 
                     in computing. Level Three: Demand (to use good practices); 
 
                     Statements of demand assert more specific behavioral responsibilities 
 
                     within software engineering which are more closely related 
 
                     to the current state of the art. The range of statements is 
 
                     from the more general aspirational statement to specific measurable 
 
                     requirements.</p>
 
                   <p align="justify">Although all levels of professional obligation 
 
                     are recognized and because the Code contains different types 
 
                     of statements, the Code is not intended to be all inclusive 
 
                     nor is it intended that its individual parts be used in isolation 
 
                     to justify errors of omissions or commission. The list of 
 
                     Principles and Clauses is not exhaustive, and should not be 
 
                     read as separating the acceptable from the unacceptable in 
 
                     professional conduct in all practical situations. The Code 
 
                     is not a simple ethical algorithm which generates ethical 
 
                     decisions. In some situations standards may conflict with 
 
                     each other or with standards from other sources. These situations 
 
                     require the software engineer to use ethical judgement to 
 
                     act in a manner which is most consistent with the spirit of 
 
                     the code of ethics, given the circumstances. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">These ethical tensions can best be answered 
 
                     by thoughtful consideration of fundamental principles, rather 
 
                     than reliance on detailed regulations. These Principles should 
 
                     influence you to consider broadly who is affected by your 
 
                     work; to examine if you and your colleagues are treating other 
 
                     human beings with due respect; to speculate on how the public 
 
                     would view your decision if they were reasonably well informed; 
 
                     to analyze how the least empowered will be affected by your 
 
                     decision; and to consider if your acts would be considered 
 
                     worthy of the ideal professional working as a software engineer. 
 
                     Since this code represents a consensus of those engaged in 
 
                     the profession one should take into account what is likely 
 
                     to be judged as the most ethical way to act in the circumstances 
 
                     by informed, respected, and experienced peers in possession 
 
                     of all the facts and only depart from such a course for profound 
 
                     reasons, backed with careful judgement. </p>
 
                   <p align="justify">The dynamic and demanding context of software 
 
                     engineering requires a code that is adaptable and relevant 
 
                     to new situations as they occur. But even in this generality, 
 
                     the code provides support for the software engineer who needs 
 
                     to take positive action by documenting the ethical stance 
 
                     of the profession; an ethical foundation to which individuals<br>
 
                     within teams and the team as a whole can appeal. The code 
 
                     also helps to define those things which are ethically improper 
 
                     to request of an software engineer. <br>
 
                     The code has an educational function, stating what is required 
 
                     of anyone wishing to join or continue in the software engineering 
 
                     community. Because it expresses the consensus of the profession 
 
                     on ethical issues it can be used as a guide to decision making 
 
                     and as means to educate both the public and aspiring professionals 
 
                     about the professional obligation of all software engineers</p>
