         evolving ethical aspects of the information highway.I have been a rep
         from IEEE on various AAAS projects involving information privacy. By
         involvement in the working groups I can bring bakcground information

       <p>As President of the company, my interests cover all aspects of Software
         Engineering as a profession. Our company is currently providing pension
         and benefits software to large employers, as well as consulting advice.
         Having us review other software developers' work is a role that seems
         to be gaining popularity with our clients.</p>
       <p>I have worked in both large and small environments, and have witnessed
         both noteworthy honesty and ethical conduct, and the extreme opposite,
         by both software developers and end?users. I can bring to the project
         a knowledge of the conflicts that arise in a large corporate environment,
         where high billings sometimes push against the boundaries of ethics.
         As well, as the President of of a small firm, I can contribute knowledge
         of the problems and solutions faced by small companies and independent
         developers. Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in
         these working groups.<br>

       <p>I am concerned about the need to create Software Engineering as a Profession.
         I believe that present academic qualifications are insufficient to judge
         a persons competance in the computer industry. I do not have any academic
         qualifications, am lousy at maths, and still have managed to become MIS
         manager at one of Irelands largest PLCs. I am now techical director of
         the Trinity Group (Ireland second largest DEC reseller) and have just
         launched an electronic mail service company. Most of the people I know
         who have 3rd level qualifications and are working in the computer industry,
         do not hold their degrees in computer?related subjects.</p>
       <p>I agree with the need for &quot;formalise&quot; all aspects of the computer
         profession, but I want to see real, industry?related testing. For instance,
         the skills required of a commercial programmer (writing business applications)
         are different from those of one writing an operating system. I have just
         employed a graduate who holds a degree, diploma, and certificate in computer
         science. When asked to plug a modem into a PC, she asked which port was
         the comm port? She had never had to do this on her courses. In a previous
         job, I employed a commercial programmer with no academic qualifications.
         She was programming *productively* in two days. I then, deliberately,
         employed a &quot;junior&quot; for her. This junior?programmer was the
         top of his class in a computer?applications degree. It took nearly 4?months
         before he could be allowed work independantly.</p>
       <p>I have been working in the industry for 15 years since I left school.
         I have been a programmer, network manager, MIS manager and consultant.</p>

       <p>My interest is in the furtherence of SW Engineering as a professional
         activity. My observation is that ANYONE and EVERYONE seems to believe
         they can develop SW applications. Many of these follow no consistent
         process or provide any supporting products to aid in maintaining these
         applications. This gives legitimate SW professionals a bad name. I believe
         that ethical standards may provide and approach to solving this problem.
         I have 20 years' of experience in developing real?time applications for
         visual simulation applications. I have dealt with a number of these semi?SW
         professionals and believe that this experience will be useful to the
         ethical standards effort.<br>

       <p>IMPORTANT ?? Please tell us about your specific interests and how your<br>
   experience will aid this project.</p>
       <p>As a practitioner and academic with over 20 years experience I am deeply
         concerned about the way software engineering is managed and how societal
         impacts are considered and taken into account. At De Montfort University,
         I have been instrumental in developing and implementing modules relating
         to these issues on our<br>
   undergraduate and postgraduate portfolios. Currently, I am pioneering a Computing
   Ethics module for final year students on our modular scheme. I am very keen
   to increase the awareness of ethics and professionalism in the UK and as such
   I am organising, in conjunction with Professor Bynum of Southern Connecticut
   State University, an international conference, ETHICOMP95, next March which
   addresses the ethical issues of IT exploitation.</p>
       <p>At a national level, I am involved with the Institute of Data Processing
         Management and currently serve on their Education Committee. I am a member
         of theParliamentary IT committee, the aim of which is to inform Government
         of the current trends in IT and how IT can be sympathetically utilised.
         I am also involved with the Higher Education Funding Council of England
         acting as a special assessor in Computer Science for quality assurance
         exercises.</p>
       <p>I would very much welcome the opportunity of participating in the working
         groups I have indicated and feel that my background, experience and contacts
         would add value to the project as a whole. I would also like to be kept
         informed of progress on the other working groups</p>
       <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

       <p>I would like to be involved in the Software Engineering Ethics and Professional
         Practices task force, in particular the Professional Competence working
         group.</p>
       <p>This is a critical item that needs to be addressed before the software
         industry can mature further. There are to many projects and packages
         that leave unfulfilled promises. I believe the disenchantment with the
         software industry and it's inability to be viewed as an engineering discipline
         is in part caused by &quot;vendors&quot; attitudes that, &quot;promises,
         functionality, quality&quot; do not matter. This needs to change and
         I think this is one way to help enlighten people in the industry that
         this industry needs to take itself seriously and it is not just here
         to create games and the like.</p>
       <p>I currently work for a systems integration company and unfortunately
         see first hand misunderstandings and the bad feelings that result from
         the disconnects. I am very passionate about this topic and feel this
         is one way I can help further the industry along and would like to be
         part of this working group.</p>
       <p>I am currently a member of IEEE, the Computer Society, and have been
         involved in commenting on and voting on standards from the Software Engineering
         Standards Subcommittees.</p>

       <p>My interest is in the furtherence of SW Engineering as a professional
         activity. My observation is that ANYONE and EVERYONE seems to believe
         they can develop SW applications. Many of these follow no consistent
         process or provide any supporting products to aid in maintaining these
         applications. This gives legitimate SW professionals a bad name. I believe
         that ethical standards may provide and approach to solving this problem.
         I have 20 years' of experience in developing real?time applications for
         visual simulation applications. I have dealt with a number of these semi?SW
         professionals and believe that this experience will be useful to the
         ethical standards effort.</p>

       <p>I deal with the education of future SEs and I believe that it is of
         great importance to teach them RIGHT early on. I Used to teach Doctoral
         level courses back in the states and many of my students were part timers
         working for big organizations. Many of them did not believe in SE and
         were still relying on &quot;ad?hoc&quot; techniques not only in civil
         applications, but in mission critical applications as well!</p>
       <p>I also do private consultation for industry. So I see both ends: academic
         and practice.</p>
       <p>Enforcing acceptable ethical/professional responsibilities on SEs I
         fell is part of my duty as a scholar and a practicing SE. From: seepp?cfp@computer.org
