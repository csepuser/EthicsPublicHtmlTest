  Dear Keith, </p>
       <p> I am a faculty member at Illinois Institute  of Technology
   and co-director of the software  engineering program in our CS dept. I am
   interested
   in the deliberations of the SEEPP  task force, especially your group on reliability
   and
   safety. Has there been any interaction within  that working group? If so
   are the e-mail transactions  or any other sort  avaiable to interested
   parties? If yes can you  foward them to me. My research interests are in
    testing
   and debugging. </p>
       <p> Thanks, </p>

       <p><br>
           <br>
  Dear Dr. Howell,  I am interested in the deliberations of  the task
 force on &quot;Software Engineering as  a Profession&quot;. In particular
 the sub-task force  on Defining the Code of Ethics and Professional  Standards.
 Has this committee begun to communicate; if so, do you know how I can get on
 the e-mail distribution list. I am a faculty member at IIT and am one of the
 co-directors of a master's program in software engineering. </p>
       <p> Thanks! </p>
       <p>Ilene Burnstein</p>
       <p><br>
   Dear Dr. Burnstein,<br>
   My apologies for the delay in a reply - I was out of the office much of Friday.
   I will forward to you some email messages related to your request -they also
   explain the intended role of the TCSE group relative to the actual working
   groups (joint IEEE/ACM). Please let me know if you have any other questions.
   I'm afraid that the TCSE discussion group has been very dormant - we don't
   get any information from the actual groups involved in the effort, so there
   isn't much to forward. I'd suggest contacting the working groups themselves
   to directly participate...</p>
       <p><br>
   Thanks,</p>

   Subject: Professional Awareness in Software Engineering<br>
   [FYI, CCH]<br>
   Professional Awareness in Software Engineering PASE'96 First Westminster Conference
   London, 1st-2nd February 1996<br>
   First Announcement and Call for Papers ------------------------------------</p>
       <p><br>
   THE NEED FOR THE CONFERENCE<br>
   - --------------------------<br>
   The conference has grown from the increasing concern of professional bodies
   and the computing industry that software engineers should be better equipped
   to meet the challenges of today's working practices. More than ever before,
   there is a need for the software practitioner to adopt a professional approach
   to deal with both technical advances and structural changes in the workplace.</p>
       <p><br>
   Many of the practices in the software world harken back to the 'Dark Ages'
     of computing, when computer people were strange and wonderful to behold:
     they did not conform to business conventions in terms of dress or behaviour.
     They were mad boffins and therefore forgiven all eccentricities. Indeed,
     they were expected to be weird. Some of these expectations are still with
     us, the software professional is still viewed as different from other professionals.
     However, we increasingly have to work in teams, deal with clients and demonstrate
     that we can behave responsibly, that is, work in a professional manner, according
     to a professional code of conduct.<br>
   The main aim of this conference is, therefore, to help determine the attitudes
   that are required for a software engineer to succeed as a professional, and
   so help to avoid software disasters, improve quality, improve user confidence
   and raise the level of job satisfaction.</p>
       <p><br>
   TOPICS<br>
   The conference offers a cross-disciplinary platform, with an emphasis on:<br>
   *Equal opportunities* in particular combatting unconscious sexism, racism and
   discrimination against physically-disadvantaged groups. *Ethical and legal
   responsibilities and liabilities* for example examining the appropriateness
   of existing professional codes of conduct. *The structure of the software industry
   as a profession* including the.role of professional bodies, market testing
   and information technology practices, the problems faced by small companies
   and the impact of outworking on employment profiles.</p>
       <p><br>
   *Work practices* including coping with methodology madness, the dangers of
     project management, the importance of software quality innovations and standards
     recognition.</p>
       <p><br>
   FEATURED SPEAKERS<br>
   - ----------------<br>
   Featured speakers at this conference include:</p>
       <p><br>
   Tom DeMarco: Observing that 'most often when organizations try to urge professionalism

   Fred Brooks: Author of 'The Mythical Man Month', reflecting on his not so mythical
   man years.</p>
       <p><br>
   Frank Bott: Co-author of 'Professional Issues in Software Engineering' on the
     selling, marketing and procuring of software.</p>
       <p><br>
   Elizabeth France: The Data Protection Registrar, debating whether software
     engineers help or hinder the protection of data.</p>

       <p>From: Elliot Chikofsky &lt;CHIKOFSKY@neu.edu<br>
   Subject: I am pursuing getting TCSE officially in the mix... d Subj: Reorganization
     of the Steering Committee (long message)<br>
   For a couple of months the presidents of the Computer Society and the ACM have
   been looking for ways to structure the steering committee in a way that would
   better reflect the interest and participation of the ACM. Following a series
   of exchanges a proposal was made by Laurel Kaleda to Gwen Bell to streamline
   the steering committee and to include equal numbers of members appointed by
   the society presidents. The ACM has agreed to the general terms of the proposal
   and we are now moving to the new organization.<br>
   - ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STATUS:</p>
       <p><br>
   This committee was created by the Board of Governors of the Computer Society
     last May and was asked to report at the November meeting of the BoG. This
     was accomplished and the four initial recommendations were accepted by the
     board. In November we were asked to initiate the implementation of the recommendations
     and report back at the next meeting (next Friday). The recommendations were:<br>
   1) Define the body of knowledge and recommended practices - we initiated a
   task force populated mostly with industry people, led by Patricia Douglas of
   IBM.<br>
   2) Define a code of ethics - we initiated a task force co-chaired by Robert
   Melford (CS) and Don Gotterbarn (ACM)<br>
   3) Define the curricula - we have agreement from Doris Carver (CS) and John
   Werth (ACM) to co-chair the task force. We did not have time to have an organizational
   meeting and besides, the spirit of the recommendation was to have this group
   track the &quot;body of knowledge&quot; task force. Doris and John are the
   heads of the &quot;education boards&quot; of the two societies and they have
   agreed to be stand-by until the other group starts producing some recommendations.
   Doris and John have agreed to join the &quot;body of knowledge&quot; task force
   so they will be up-to-speed when the time comes.</p>
       <p><br>
   A fourth recommendation called for &quot;definition of terms&quot;. This is
   probably better done by the three task forces since they are the ones who will
   identify the terms that need to be in the &quot;glossary&quot;. Furthermore,
   there are various IEEE standards that might provide the bulk of the definitions,
   so there is not urgent need to have this as a separate &quot;task force&quot;.<br>
   We have essentially accomplished our job and next Friday, at the BoG meeting
   I will report these activities. At that point the new.organization will kick
   in</p>
       <p>NEW ORGANIZATION:</p>
       <p>I would like to quote a paragraph from Laurel's letter to Gwen describing
         the new organization:</p>
       <p><br>
   The members of the steering committee will include Mario who will continue
     as chair, a vice-chair (appointed by you as president of the ACM), and six
     members, three appointed by each society by whatever mechanism and for whatever
     terms the societies may choose. The steering committee may add additional
     members (such as the chairs of the task forces established by the steering
     committee) as ex officio, nonvoting members of the steering committee. Mario
     may identify other details to be worked out, but these are the general guidelines
     under which we can get started.</p>
       <p><br>
   Stu Sweben will be the Vice-chair appointed by the ACM. The other 6 appointments
     will be announced shortly.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p> NO MEETING NEXT WEEK:<br>
   As you recall, a few weeks ago I asked who would be around new Monday in San
     Francisco, in case we needed to do some work on the report to be presented
     on Friday. In light of the restructuring, it is probably not necessary to
     have the meeting on Monday (only a handful of us could attend anyway.) The
     report will be short and sweet: the accomplishments outline above plus the
     plans produced by the two operating task forces.<br>
   Unless there is something urgent, let's call the meeting off. Those of us who
   are there could adjourn to the CS hopitality suite and have a toast to our
   great work :-)<br>
   - ----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
   I want to thank all of you for your effort and your contribution to the profession.
   The new steering committee will be a very small body and its role will be to
   oversee the work of the task forces. The real fun work will be done by the
   task forces and I would invite all of you to continue your involvement by joining
   those groups that are closer to your personal interests.<br>
   Best regards,<br>

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
   June 14, 1994<br>
 &quot;COMPUTING ETHICS: WORLD'S TWO LARGEST COMPUTER PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES JOIN
 FORCES IN INTERNATIONAL PROJECT&quot;</p>
       <p><br>
   Washington, DC, Rayburn House Office Building, Congressional Briefing, organized
     by Representatives George Brown (D-CA) and Edward Markey<br>
   (D-MA), in cooperation with the National Computer Ethics and<br>
   Responsibilities Campaign, (June 21, 1994) -- </p>
       <p>The world's two largest organizations of computing professionals, with
         a combined membership of more than one hundred and seventy-five thousand
         members (world-wide), have mounted a joint effort to establish internationally
         recognized standards for the professional and ethical conduct of &lt;'
         software engineers. The Washington, DC based IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS),
         and the New York, NY based Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
         recently established their joint task force on Software Engineering Ethics
         and Professional Practices (SEEPP.) to &quot;codify and document the
         software engineering profession's collective kr, . k N wisdom for resolving
         ethical conflicts,&quot; said Robert J. Melford, Computer Society Co-chair
         for the task force. </p>
       <p><br>
   ACM Co-chair Dr. Donald Gotterbarn added, &quot;this task force will focus &#8222;r
   both on 'Ethics' and 'Standards of Practice.' The latter will provide &quot;'
   guidelines and recommended practices to help computing professionals meet their
   professional obligations to quality and higher care in difficult situations.&quot; Both
   Co-chairs went on to emphasize, &quot;software engineering is a profession
   whose activities are trans-national; the SEEPP task force must also address
   cultural, organizational, and national characteristics that bear on a global
   definition of Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices.&quot; The
   SEEPP task force is approaching the one-third mark of an aggressive eighteen
   month schedule to complete its work. Computing professionals from throughout
   the world are being invited to participate in the standards' development process.
   Melford and Gotterbarn explained that the task force is using &quot;a.recognized
   methodology for developing and documenting the profession's consensus, in an
   international venue.&quot; The methodology is derived from the IEEE Computer
   Society's extensive work in developing and establishing internationally recognized
   standards for the design, test, construction, and operation of computer hardware
   and software, and for the management of software engineering projects. ACM's
   recent work in developing and disseminating a Code of Ethics and Professional
   Conduct for its members also should be of great value to the task force. The
   task force has organized eight different Standards Working Groups, which are
   charged with addressing specific areas of ethical interest and concern.</p>
       <p><br>
   Melford and Gotterbarn stated that the working groups on Privacy, Security,
     Intellectual Property, Professional Competence, Professional Relationships,
     and Social Justice address &quot;issues and principles.&quot; Gotterbarn
     explained that the eighth working group, Institutional Support, will address
     such things as how to establish and operate a &quot;Hot Line&quot; where
     software engineers could query recognized experts about ethical problems
     they were encountering. Both Chairman also noted that the task force could
     establish additional working groups to address other areas of concern if
     there was sufficient volunteer interest.</p>
       <p><br>
   The SEEPP task force is part of a larger project, the Joint IEEE-CS/ACM Steering
     Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering as a Profession.
     The Steering Committee has also established two other task forces: the first
     one to review academic curriculum; and, the second one to identify the body
     of knowledge and recommended practices. Dr. Mario Barbacci and Prof. Stuart
     Zweben are Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively.</p>

   SOFTWARE ENGINEERING: ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS OF PRACTICE<br>
   JOINT IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY / ACM PROJECT WORKING GROUPS FORMING<br>
   17 October 1994</p>
       <p><br>
   Dear Computing Professional,<br>
   The IEEE Computer Society and the ACM, the world's two largest organizations
   of computing professionals, with a combined membership of more than one hundred
   and seventy-five thousand members (worldwide) have established a Joint Steering
   Committee for the Establishment of Software Engineering as a Profession. This
   steering committee has established three tasks forces to accomplish their mission.
   One task force is identifying the body of knowledge and recommended practices,
   and another task force is addressing educational issues. Our task force on
   Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices (SEEPP) is tasked with
   documenting and codifying standards of ethical and professional practices for
   Software Engineers. We invite your participation in this task. You do NOT need
   to be a member of either society in order to participate.</p>
       <p><br>
   1.0 SCOPE These standards shall document generally accepted principles for
     identifying and resolving ethical conflicts relevant to the discipline of
     software engineering.<br>
   Consideration shall be given to the responsibilities and obligations of the
   Software Engineer to peers and laypersons, employer, customer(s), the profession
   and society/humanity. Additionally, consideration shall be similarly given
   to the obligations and responsibilities of these various entities towards the
   Software Engineer.</p>
       <p><br>
   1.1 GLOBAL APPLICATION The SEEPP task force recognizes that the design, development
     and application of software often transcend national boundaries. We feel
     that it is vitally important that the global computing community have the
     means to insure that this project produces a product which is as reflective
     of the global computing community's wisdom as can be reasonably achieved.
     The participation of individuals from throughout the world is important to
     achieving this goal. These standards are intended to document the consensus
     of the.global software engineering community. From time to time, consensus
     on an issue may not be clearly recognized. Accordingly, these standards shall
     also document various recommended practices and guidelines when no clear
     consensus can be established.</p>
       <p><br>
   2.0 PURPOSE The purpose of the SEEPP task force is to document the international
     consensus for minimally acceptable ethical/professional responsibilities
     and obligations of Software Engineers.</p>
       <p><br>
   3.0 ORGANIZATION Working groups are being formed to address specific areas
     of concern. Eight different subject areas are distinguished so far, as described
     below. Should additional subject areas be identified, additional working
     groups may be established.</p>

   3.1 PARTICIPATION Participation is open to all individuals who are directly
     and materially affected or interested in these issues.<br>
   Members of the international computing community are particularly encouraged
   to participate.</p>
       <p><br>
   3.1.1 WORKING GROUP MEMBERSHIP Individuals may participate in as many working
     groups as they desire.</p>
       <p><br>
   3.1.2 ORGANIZATIONAL/INSTITUTIONAL PARTICIPATION If organizations desire to
     send an organizational representative, they shall be accommodated. Their
     inputs will be valued and processed as would any other input. However, no
     organization shall be permitted a veto power over results that reflect the
     consensus of the concerned professionals in the field..</p>
       <p>3.1.3 WORKING GROUP MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION<br>
   PLEASE COMPLETE THE APPLICATION AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT AND E-MAIL IT TO
     SEEPP-CFP@COMPUTER.ORG, BEFORE 5-NOVEMBER-1994.<br>
   We are organizing the working groups on 12 November 1994.</p>
       <p><br>
   3.1.4 EXPENSES Participation is voluntary. Each individual is responsible for
     all expenses incurred to support his/her participation. Many institutions
     provide financial support for their volunteers.</p>
       <p><br>
   3.2 &quot;OFFICIAL&quot; IEEE STANDARD Working groups will operate according
   to the procedures specified for IEEE Standards (see Governance, below). However,
   working groups will NOT be initially chartered by the IEEE Computer Society's
   Standards Activities Board. (If the working groups were so chartered, individuals
   in several countries would be required to receive their government's approval
   for participation.)</p>
       <p><br>
   3.3 GOVERNANCE The conduct of each working group shall follow the same written
     procedures that govern internationally recognized IEEE Standards Activities.
     These procedures specify that prompt consideration should be given to the
     written views and objections of all participants. Objectors should be notified
     of the disposition of an objection and the reasons therefor. Unresolved objections
     and the associated reasons should be reported to the entire working group's
     membership. The conclusions of the group should be supported by a consensus
     of the membership. (This would imply a ballot on the final products, probably
     run as IEEE Draft Standards ballots are currently run.)</p>
       <p><br>
   3.4 E-MAIL &amp; MEETINGS Working group business is expected to be primarily
   conducted via e-mail and computer mediated conferencing. From time to time,
   a working group may also conduct face to face or teleconference meetings. These
   meetings should be conducted in a manner whic h facilitates attendance by as
   many members as possible.</p>
       <p><br>
   4.0 INTERNET ACCESS Each working group member should have a valid Internet
     e-mail account. The member should also be prepared to obtain access to other
     Internet applications such as FTP, TELNET, Gopher, WAIS WWW/MOSAIC, etc.</p>
       <p><br>
